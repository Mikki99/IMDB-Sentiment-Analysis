1,"This is one of the worst episodes of the series, so I'm going to try hard to review it without completely blowing a gasket. It all began when Hot Lips was all aflutter for a visiting colonel, and a female colonel at that. She kept fumbling up in O.R., so Hawkeye sends her out. They get into an argument in the scrub room, and she tells Frank to do something about it. What can he do? Well, he childishly takes a towel and snaps Hawkeye with it. Now, Hawkeye could have been a man and ignored this, figuring this simpleton isn't worth any kind of retaliation, but no, instead he rears back and punches him. Right away, he and Trapper deny any assault took place, but Frank still wants a court martial. Henry is reluctant, because of the paperwork and having to actually do his job and all, but Frank insists, and while the papers are drawn up, Hawkeye is placed under house arrest, which he absolutely adores. Father Mulcahy brings him a prisoners-of-war care-package and the cook makes him a genuine steak to thank him for hitting Burns.Colonel Reese eventually shows up. She isn't the model of perfection Hot Lips was hoping for, but rather a wise-cracking, flirtatious shrew who takes quite a shine to Frank. By the way, before I continue, there's a subplot about Radar buying altered pants and elevator shoes because he's tired of all the height insults he gets. I think this would have been a more appropriate A plot instead of a B, but I'm not the idiots who wrote this. So anyway, they decide to show the movie in the Swamp so Hawkeye can see it, and everybody crowds in the tent, while Frank goes to look to Hot Lips and instead finds Reese in her tent. The colonel flirts with Burns and promises big things for him, and so they get into the throes of intimacy, but when Hot Lips walks in on them, this happens: Colonel Reese screams ""Rape!"" This gets everyone's attention, particularly Trapper being excited about going to a rape. So now the bitch colonel wants to file charges on Frank for no reason and Hot Lips lies about the scrub room incident, so now Hawkeye is found innocent and Frank is under house arrest.Oh, House Arrest, how do I hate thee? Let me count the ways: 1) Horrible script by Jim Fritzell and Everett Greenbaum. Whoever said they were the show's best writers wouldn't know good writing if it bit him on the ear. I could've written a better script than this. 2) Horrible direction by Hy Averback. 3) Horrible acting. Everybody phoned this one in, especially Mary Wickes. 4) Horrible all-around idea. For the love of God, why did they think this was a good idea?! Frank Burns getting punched, not that didn't deserve it, then Hawkeye going under house arrest and everybody treating him like a victim, then this Colonel Reese bitch coming in and accusing Frank of rape, getting him in trouble for no reason! This blows my mind on so many levels. I HATE this episode! I HATE, HATE, HATE it with a fiery passion and I advise all M*A*S*H fans to avoid it. If you like this or thought it was funny, you're sick. This was the meanest, most unfair display I have ever seen. So what if Frank is a Class-A jerk-wad, he was still treated unfairly here. Viewers, again, stay away from this garbage! It will make you very angry and curse the day you first laid eyes on it. I can't put into words how acrimonious it's made me. Screw you, House Arrest!",-1
9,"A lot has has been made about Hawkeye belting Frank. It wasnt the first time he tried to attack Frank, nor would it be the last. As for his being Mr Pacifist, yep, he was being a hypocrite, but we all are at times. I liked the episode, despite the cringeworthy rape joke, Mary Wickes hits it out the park like she always did, And while this wasn't Fritzell & Greenbaum's best effort, there's enough of their unique, folksy humor to move things along.",1
7,"Let me say from the outset I'm not a particular fan of this kind of film, but Nightbreed holds a certain fascination for me with a message about perspective.Back in the old days, the folks who inhabit Midian would have been called Zombies, the undead. And according to what Clive Barker has given us certain members of human kind, in this Craig Sheffer are born with the potential to become part of that world.Psychiatrist David Cronenberg at first looking like the mild mannered professional has taken unto himself a fanatical mission to rid the world of the Nightbreed. He tricks the police into killing Sheffer, but Sheffer goes to a graveyard named Midian cemetery where the Nightbreed congregate and live underground. Sheffer has also left a girl friend, Anne Bobby, who still has feelings for him even after he's been killed and is now one of the undead. She tries in her own small way to be a bridge to humankind. Clive Barker's creatures are a pretty gruesome looking lot and are not particularly fond of humans. But it's plain to see that if humans left them alone, the Nightbreed in turn not bother with them.Your sympathies are definitely with the Nightbreed especially after seeing a fanatic like Cronenberg and redneck police chief Charles Haid in action.Clive Barker's been an out gay man for some time now and some have suggested to me that the Nightbreed is a metaphor for gay people. I can see where that would come in, especially since there are a whole lot of people who don't even think of gays as anything human because they're taught that way.Granted Nightbreed is pretty bloody with a lot of gratuitous violence, but it also does make you think and I do like the way Clive Barker does turn traditional theology on its head and makes Craig Sheffer a kind of messiah for the Nightbreed creatures.",1
6,Aaron Boone (Craig Sheffer) has disturbing dreams of Midian where monsters live. Psychiatrist Dr. Decker (David Cronenberg) is treating him and convinces him that he committed a series of murders. He tries to go to Midian for real and is rejected by its inhabitants. The police catches up to him outside the gates and Decker tricks the police into killing Boone. Boone is resurrected and he is accepted into Midian. His girlfriend Lori Winston tracks down Boone but she is followed by Decker who turns out to be the real monster.Clive Barker is not quite good enough to direct this. Cronenberg is competent as a villain but he would have been a far superior choice as the director. This is filled with the grotesque and weird monstrosities. Some of it is very effective gore. Narcisse slicing through his own head is amazing although other creatures are less effective. There's only so much real makeup can do and CGI is rather primitive. The movie attempts for grand horror but Barker doesn't have it in him. He is still stuck in a lot of B-movie horror tropes. The cops are too silly. There are not enough good actors for the minor roles.EDIT: Director's Cut It's been so long that I can't tell what's been added in this version. There's almost twenty minutes more. This probably flowed a bit better although it could cut down Anne Bobby's singing. Neither her nor Craig Sheffer are A-list performers. The limitations are still the same in this extended cut. I still don't see why body-horror expert Cronenberg isn't doing the directing. He's right there on set already. The creature creations are pretty good especially considering the limited budget although Midian is short-changed. It needs to be more other-worldly. The secondary acting is still B-level. This will never be better than a relatively good B-movie. I do wonder if a bigger remake could be great.,1
7,"A masked serial-killer is slaughtering families. Meanwhile, the youngster Aaron Boone (Craig Sheffer) has nightmares with monsters in a place called Midian. He has therapy with the psychiatric Dr. Philip K. Decker (David Cronenberg) and his girlfriend Lori Winston (Anne Bobby) wants to travel on vacation with him. When Aaron visits Dr. Decker for a session, the doctor convinces him that he is a serial-killer and asks Aaron to turn himself in to the police. He also gives a medication to calm him down. However it is indeed a hallucinogen and Aaron is hit by a truck. He awakes in a hospital where he shares a room with the insane Narcisse (Hugh Ross). When he overhears the man talking about Midian, Aaron learns the direction to reach the place. He heads to the place and finds that Midian is a cemetery. Further, there are monsters hidden from the humans in the underground and is bitten by Peloquin (Oliver Parker). Aaron flees from the monsters and finds Dr. Decker, Detective Joyce (Hugh Quarshie) and a team of police officers waiting for him outside the cemetery. Decker lies and yells that Aaron has a gun and he is murdered by the police. However the bite revives him and he goes to Midian, where he joins a society of monsters hidden in the underground. Meanwhile Lori is seeking him out while Decker wants to destroy the ancient breed of monsters.""Nightbreed"" is a cult-horror-fantasy film by Clive Barker. The film is highly entertaining but screenplay has an abrupt beginning and a deceptive conclusion. The DVD I saw does not have an alternate ending in accordance with the director's cut, but the description gives a perfect conclusion to this film. Aaron says goodbye to Lori, but she suicides and resurrects as a Nightbreed. There is no resurrection of Decker and Ashberry kills Eigerman that is seeking revenge. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Raça das Trevas"" (""Darkness Breed"")Note: On 19 July 2020, I saw this film again.",1
6,"The editor of the new cut (also called Cabal Cut at the moment) is touring with this ""new"" version around the world. I did watch it at Frightfest, but the people responsible for that are touring the world with it. Next stop will be Bottrop in Germany, at a convention in November 2012. Of course you should be aware that the newly inserted footage is taken from a VHS. For those too young to remember: It equals bad quality! Project that on one of the biggest screens (as it happened at Frightfest) and you might get nausea.But this was my first encounter with Nightbreed, because I hadn't seen the movie before that. I have to admit, the not yet restored scenes did require some time getting used to. The movie as whole feels a bit too long (maybe the producers were onto something for once?). But I'm glad I had the opportunity to watch it in its entirety. There will further cuts until they're satisfied (and the audience watching) with the result.The story is actually pretty good (I haven't read the novel, but I guess this is as close as it gets), but some of the acting didn't really convince me. David Cronenberg was good, but also very weird. Than again, the whole movie has this strange vibe to it. Not sure what to make of it and will definitely not appeal to the masses. Try it if you get the chance",1
5,"Boone has dreams of a city called Midian where the monsters live. He is not alone -- others have dreamt of it, too, and the reason is because it may just be real. That is interesting enough, but then we have the other plot: Boone is also suspected of being a masked serial killer who has amassed more than fifteen victims.Clive Barker wrote this story (as ""Cabal"") and directed the film. It is probably his weakest film, despite an underground fan following. It clearly does not rank on the level of ""Hellraiser"". Yes, it has a decent cast such as Doug Bradley and Simon Bamford (though Doug was almost completely unrecognizable). And there is David Cronenberg, probably one of the greatest directors who ever lived, playing a really creepy psychiatrist. I think it is fair to say he is the highlight of the film. In fact, without Cronenberg, the film would have been a complete waste of time.The film has some major plot issues Where did the priest come from? He shows up and acts as though he was in the film the entire time, though we know this to be false. In fact, he then becomes a main character somehow. Is there an earlier scene with him that got edited out? Why is the psychiatrist so intent on wiping out Midian? Why does he care? And why should we care about the ""nightbreed""? None of their characters is ever developed. And why are they called a different race when it is clear that people can cross over? It is just so strange that the more questions you ask, the fewer answers you will get.The film as a whole has too much going on. Focusing on the serial killer part would have been enough, but they introduce thirty characters and develop none of them. Recently, an additional 44 minutes of footage was found from the film. Would it probably explain the plot better? Yes. But is it worth sitting through a three-hour version of this film? I suspect not. If two hours was just average (at best), the longer version could not improve on this.Now, I still support its release. Clive Barker is fighting Morgan Creek, who refuse to release or sell the footage, so for those who want to see it, they cannot. And, to be fair, some is just a second here or there cut by the MPAA (the hospital scene where the man removes his face was trimmed down, for example).Should you see this? Well, if you like Clive Barker, yes. Or Doug Bradley (though you cannot even recognize him due to the German voice dub). But it is not one of the better films I have seen... none of my reference books even mention it! That is a sad state of affairs!",-1
8,"Troubled young man Aaron Boone (a likeable and passable performance by Craig Sheffer) gets set up as a serial killer by cunning and deranged psychiatrist Dr. Philip K. Decker (well played with chilling understatement by noted film director David Cronenberg). However, it turns out Boone is actually a monster messiah in disguise who Decker is using as a means of finding a mythical creature Shangri-La called Midian.Writer/director Clive Barker delivers a potent and provocative horror/fantasy allegory on mankind's cruelty, hatred, and intolerance towards anyone or anything different that goes outside man's ability to understand and subsequently accept. Moreover, Barker presents a dazzling array of monsters that are exotic, grotesque, sympathetic, and wholly convincing: The magical underground world of Midian and its colorful inhabitants are both beautifully realized.In addition, it's acted with zeal by an able cast: Anne Bobby as Boone's concerned girlfriend Lori Winston, Charles Haid as hateful bigot Captain Eigerman, Hugh Quarshie as the pragmatic Detective Joyce, Hugh Ross as the raucous Narcisse, Doug Bradley as peaceful Moses-like leader Dirk Lylesberg, Catherine Chevalier as the alluring Rachel, Oliver Parker as the ferocious Peloquin, and Malcolm Smith as weak drunken priest Ashberry. Popping up in nifty small roles are John Agar as an ill-fated gas station owner, prolific British bit player Harry Fielder as the redneck who gets taken out by little black demon Devil Lude, and splatterpunk writers John Skipp and Craig Spector as a couple of bloodied dead bodies in a hotel room. Robin Vidgeon's vibrant cinematography offers a wealth of stunning visuals. Danny Elfman's robust and majestic orchestral score hits the rousing spot. A superior creature feature.",1
4,"Plagued by weird dreams of a mythical place called Midian, Aaron Boone (Craig Sheffer) is drawn into a nightmarish world of monsters and madmen, with adoring girlfriend Lori (Anne Bobby) in tow.I first saw Clive Barker's Nightbreed in 1990 and couldn't believe that it was from the same man who gave us the excellent Hellraiser: the film was a total mess. I have since learnt that the movie was the victim of studio interference and that some footage was excised against Barker's wishes, but to be honest, more of the same doesn't make the experience any better. The Director's Cut still suffers from a dreadful story, weak performances, bad special effects (that cemetery matte painting is awful!), lousy monsters (pathetic creatures that we, the viewers, are supposed to empathise with), and an all-pervading, overblown score from Danny Elfman (of which the chanting sections sound uncannily similar to that old advert for Meow Mix ""I want chicken, I want liver"").Only David Cronenberg, as hooded serial killer psychiatrist Dr. Philip K. Decker, impresses, his character being a truly scary creation (although I still haven't quite figured out how he can see through those buttons on his mask); to be honest, I wish the whole film had been about Decker it would have been a whole lot more entertaining than this muddled monster mash.3.5 out of 10, rounded up to 4 for IMDb.",-1
5,"I remember watching ""Nightbreed"" sometime during my teenage years and then again later on into my adult years. Then I decided to revisit it again, because I did remember it fondly.Now, I must admit that ""Nightbreed"" was actually weighed down by a fairly tame storyline, which was odd, because I remembered it to be much more entertaining. However, this lack of a deeper storyline, was more than made up for with lots of interesting make-up effects on the numerous members of the tribe.There was some good acting performances put on by an equally good cast, which includes the likes of Craig Sheffer and Doug Bradley.""Nightbreed"" is sort of a surreal mixture of horror and grotesque imagination from writer and director Clive Barker. But of course, one would suspect such an endeavor from a creative mind such as his, especially with all his other interesting work.This movie is not particularly outstanding in terms of the horror genre, although the creature design is something that will actually be imprinted in your memory for a long, long time. And that was a great accomplishment, in my opinion.I believe this is the third or fourth time that I have actually watched ""Nightbreed"" since it was initially released back in 1990.",-1
8,"Directed by Clive Barker and based on his 1988 novella Cabal, this movie was a commercial and critical failure. Barker has always claimed that the producers tried to sell the film as a run of the mill slasher, when it is anything but. In 2014, he finally was able to release a director's cut that fixed many of his issues.Aaron Boone (Craig Sheffer, Fire in the Sky) dreams of a place called Midian where monsters are accepted. His girlfriend Lori has convinced him to start seeing a psychotherapist named Dr. Phillip Decker, who is ably played by David Cronenberg of all people. All along, Decker has been setting Boone up for the murders that he's been committing, giving his LSD instead of lithium and filling his head with details of the murders.Decker urges Boone to turn himself in, but he's hit by a truck and sent to the hospital where he meets Narcisse, another man who knows about Midian. He explains to Boone how to get to the hidden story while he cuts off his own face.Boone makes his way to Midian, where he meets the creatures who make it their home like Kinski (Nicholas Vince, the Chattering Cenobite from Hellraiser) and Peloquin, a demonic creature who smells Boone's innocence, letting him know that there's no way that the murders could have been his doing. He bites Boone, who runs into a police trap led by Decker and is shot and killed.He'd be dead if it wasn't for Peloquin's bite. Soon, he returns to life in the morgue while his girlfriend decides to come looking for Midian herself. Boone becomes part of the Nightbreed thanks to their leader Dirk Lylesburg (Doug Bradley, Pinhead himself) and from the touch of their god, Baphomet.What follows is a battle between the police and clergy versus the Nightbreed, ending with Boone rallying the supernatural creatures and destroying their home to stop the attacks. Decker is stopped, Baphomet discusses that this was all part of the prophecy and he renames Boone Cabal.There are two different endings of the film, depending on the original and director's cut that change the story significantly. One raises Decker from the dead while another places Lori into the Nightbreed. Both set the stage for further adventures that never happened, sadly.Barker wanted this to be the Star Wars of horror films and envisioned a trilogy of stories. But the film wasn't marketed well and never made back its budget. Barker said that the producers expressed a concern that ""the monsters are the good guys,"" to which he replied, ""That's the point.""Marvel's Epic imprint put out several comic books and there were serveral video games, but soon the film slided away into obscurity, Luckily, with the excitement around the director's and Cabal cuts of the film being released, SyFy, Morgan Creek and Barker have announced an entirely new series based on the movie.Interestingly enough, Filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky spoked well of Nightbreed, calling it ""the first truly gay horror fantasy epic"", as he saw the movie being all about the ""unconsummated relationship between doctor and patient.""There are plenty of music ties in this film, as the role of Ohnaka was first intended for singer Marc Almond and Suzi Quatro was in the film, but her scenes were cut. It's also one of the first films that Danny Elfman scored after Batman. Barker stated that ""The most uncompromised portion of that entire movie is the score.""Nightbreed has more than held up, reminding me of the convention season of 1990 when you could see buttons and shirts of this movie everywhere. My excitement was at a fever pitch and I thought, ""This is going to be huge."" Shows how smart I was.",1
4,"It took me YEARS to finally see this film again. I once began watching it at the age of 10 (I knowway too young) and got terrified. There's this scene near the beginning of Nightbreed in which a madman  wearing the scariest mask ever  butchers an entire family. Pretty creepy, I assure youand I never really dared to watch it again until now. Now, I still think Nightbreed is able to cause nightmares to some peopleas it is stuffed with gruesome monsters and a fair amount of unpleasant killing scenes. Not that it is very scaryit's just constant artillery of ugliness.
For the second time, Clive Barker turned his own novel into a scenario. When compared to Hellraiser (which happens to be my favorite film of all time), Nightbreed is nothing more then rubbish! Regretfully, Barker didn't succeed in creating the same sober and chilling atmosphere and the attempted moral ruins the whole film. Cronenberg and Haid are supposed to be the personifications of modern evil and Barker tries to tell us they're much more dangerous than a couple of mutant outcasts who're living underneath an abandoned cemetery. It's better not to compare it with Hellraiser too much; otherwise you'll feel terribly cheated. Clive Barker's direction looks amateurish and untidy and the acting isn't a real highlight, neither. David Cronenberg is a much better director than he is an actor but it was nice to see him in this roleI'll admit that. And I would lie if I said there was absolutely nothing to enjoy about Nightbreed. The settings are pretty cool and the music is truly terrific. Thanks to Danny Elfman's guiding musical score, there are a few memorable sequences in this film, after all. Actually, if you cut back on the ugly monsters a bit and maintain Elfman's musicit practically is a Tim Burton film! All together: NOT recommended!",-1
5,"I'm not much of a Barker fan . I've read all his BOOKS OF BLOOD but was put off them by his self indulgent purple prose writing . But nevertheless I really enjoyed HELLRAISER which I rate as the greatest horror film ever made and looked forward to seeing NIGHTBREED ****** SPOILERS ******Oh gawd what a disappointment . I've never read Barker's novel CABAL but feel I may have to in order to make sense of this film adaption . Why is Dr Decker( Who I thought Cronenberg played very well ) bumping off people ? Why does he pick Boone to be the patsy ? What criteria do peoples' souls have to meet in order to enter Midian ? This is a classic example of an underdeveloped script , the answers to these questions may be obvious to the screenwriter/adaptor but they leave the audience totally puzzled . But the thing that confused was the way the film was marketed as "" A horror movie where the humans are the bad guys "" ! Well apart from this being a bad premise for a horror film I was confused as to how the humans can be uniformily "" "" bad "" ? Yes they attack the monsters lair but this is because they believe they've been behind the murder of humans along with Boone . There's absolutely no idication any human knows Decker was responsible . In other words they're guilty of nothing more than wanting to protect their community from more hideous murders . Is there anything wrong with this concept ? In my opinion - NO ! And the attack on Midian is way over the top. NIGHTBREED is set in Canada but the rednecks here are equipped with assault rifles , flame throwers and rocket launchers , since when have Canadian citizens been allowed to own these ? Despite these serious flaws I'm sad to see that Clive Barker seems to have retired from making films because I was hoping he'd become a big name in the British film industry . Which reminds me : If NIGHTBREED was filmed on location in Canada with the ( Not very convincing )studio exteriors filmed in Britain with a mainly British cast and crew then why is it classed as an American film ?",-1
8,"Note: this review and rating applies to the directors' cut recently released on DVD and Blu-ray by Scream Factory.Clive Barkers' adaptation of his own story Cabal is one that actually could be described as epic in this incarnation. While it would have been even nicer to get to know our characters a little better before the darkness falls, the film succeeds on a visceral and visual level. The look is something special, and the theme is resonant. The end result comes about through intolerance, hatred, and xenophobia, and one cannot help but root for the monsters. Unfortunately, the producers at Morgan Creek did not see eye to eye with Barker, and compromised his vision. They didn't think it possible for monsters to be sympathetic or to be heroes.Craig Sheffer stars as Aaron Boone, a young man unsure of whether or not he is committing murders. His psychiatrist, Philip Decker (a well cast David Cronenberg) is not really any help. Unfortunately, the police are convinced that Boone's a killer, and track him down to the gates of a mysterious community named Midian. There he is pumped full of bullets. However, what Boone had wanted was to become a part of this community, believing that it's a place where sin can be forgiven. The monsters soon accept him as one of their own.Sheffer is okay, but is easily out acted by Cronenberg, who creates a memorable creep indeed. Anne Bobby is very appealing as Lori, Boones' lover who embarks on a journey into this other world in search of answers. Charles Haid is excellent as a gung ho antagonist, police captain Eigerman. The very fine supporting cast also includes Hugh Quarshie, Doug Bradley, Catherine Chevalier, Nicholas Vince, and Simon Bamford. It's a treat to see screen veteran John Agar in a small role.The varied and vivid makeup effects work on all of the characters is most impressive. Hats off to Bob Keen and his company Image Animation for all of their efforts.In addition to an engaging romance at the centre of things, Barker is able to create a fierce, dynamic apocalyptic climax that should have its viewers' full attention.A creature feature with a sensitivity towards its creatures, ""Nightbreed"" is definitely worth a look, or another one, for fans of the genre.Eight out of 10.",1
7,"Aaron Boone (Craig Sheffer) keeps having dreams about strange creatures and a cemetery. His loving girlfriend Lori (Anne Bobby) stays with him because she loves him. Psychiatrist Philip Deeker (David Cronenberg) is trying to help Aaron...or is he? Aaron is killed and then the nightbreed (a breed of undead creatures) make him one of their own. It all ends up with an all out war.As everyone knows this film is a disaster. Before it was released the studio (20th Century Fox) cut out almost 30 MINUTES out of the film much to the fury of writer/producer/director Clive Barker. What's left is a very interesting movie which (sadly) has huge gaps in the plot and very choppy editing. I blame the studio for this--not Barker. Also it was horribly advertised and died quickly. It DOES have some glaring faults--there was also a hilarious continuity error in which Lori is being chased in a graveyard and it goes from day to night and back to day again! Also Sheffer is lousy in his role and the ending was just horrible. I caught it in a theatre back in 1990. It WAS confusing and a mess but there was (and is) a lot of good material there to see what MIGHT have been.The story lacked a real strong back story about the Nightbreed (I attribute this to the editing) but you understand enough to get the plot. The makeup and sound effects are excellent and Danny Elfman provides a GREAT score to the movie. Also there's impressive set designs--especially with Deeker's lair and the Nightbreed's home. Also the movie makes you feel for the Nightbreed at the end and puts the audience firmly on their side--NOT an easy thing to do. Sheffer aside the acting is great by everybody. The actors playing the Nightbreed seem to be having a whale of a time even though they have tons of makeup on. Also Bobby has nothing to do but whine and search for Aaron--but she pulls it off. Also look for Doug Bradley (Pinhead from the ""Hellraiser"" films), horror authors John Skipp and Craig Spector and genre great John Agar in small roles.Hopefully we'll see a directors cut one day--but it's been 20 years so I don't think so. What's left is a flawed but very good horror movie. Worth seeking out if you're a horror fan.",1
6,"Based upon Clive Barker's own novel 'Cabal' this was his second feature film as director after the far superior Hellraiser. The film follows Aaron Boone (Craig Sheffer) and his girlfriend Lori Winston (Anne Bobby) as he is implicated in a series of brutal murders committed by his psychologist Dr. Phillip K. Decker (David Cronenberg, in front of the camera for a change instead of behind it). Decker uses taped sessions to frame him. Boone also has recurring nightmares about monsters and a place called Midian. Decker convinces Boone that he is responsible for the gruesome killings. Boone, high on drugs given to him by Decker, is involved in an accident and is hit by a truck. While in hospital he over hears another patient talking about Midian. Boone questions him and finds out Midian is located under a cemetery. Once there he discovers the 'nightbreed' the last remains of ancient races that mankind have driven to almost total extinction. He is attacked and bitten on the shoulder by one such creature Peloquin (Oliver Parker). He manages to escape only to find Decker and the police waiting for him outside, the police shoot him. Later on that night in the morgue Boone comes back to life and becomes one of the nightbreed, he travels back to Midian and is accepted as one. But right behind him people are becoming aware of Midian's existence, Lori who wants to be with Boone, plus Decker, and the local Sheriff (Charles Haid) who together are intent on destroying Midian and it's residents. I was disappointed with what ended up on the screen here. I never felt anything for any of the characters, human or otherwise. Except for Cronenberg's masked serial killer Dr. Decker. I found the monsters in this dull and uninteresting unlike the Cenobites from Barker's Hellraiser. Most of them are just people with a bit of face make up. The make up effects, credited to Image Animation, are kept mostly in shadow and shown in flashes, when we do get a look at some of the better designs they are impressive, although I couldn't get the thought of an actor in a cheap rubber mask out of my head. Midian itself is also mainly kept in the dark, but it appears nothing more than tunnels connected by wooden bridges. There's not much blood or gore, certainly when you compare it to Barker's Hellraiser, but a horror film doesn't have to be gory to be good. The problem is Barker's script, as I've already mentioned most of the characters, both human and nightbreed, are dull and underdeveloped, except Cronenberg you won't care about any of them. His insistence on religion and heavy handed morals don't help either, Barker constantly tries to tell us that a cemetery full of monsters isn't as terrible as the local Sheriff and his police officers, and just about anyone else from the 'natural' world. And he throws in a priest at the end Father Ashberry (Malcolm Smith) who runs around among all the explosions and fire at the end rambling to himself about god. Danny Elfman's score sounds like just about all his others. There's no real coherent story to it, and it doesn't go anywhere or finish in a particularly satisfying manner. It's different and better than a lot of unoriginal unimaginative horror films, but ultimately I found it to be disappointing, maybe I was just expecting too much. I'm sure Barker's original cut that he was forced to chance would be better, but I doubt we'll ever see it. A missed opportunity.",1
7,"Clive Barker of Hellraiser fame has written and produced a fantasy horror film that is funny and exciting.The make-up done by Bob Keen and Geoffrey Portass was fantastic. It took quite an imagination to come up with these mutants that lived underground. It was really a treat to see the quality of work.It wasn't particularly horrible, as the worst creature was actually a human serial killer.I just saw Craig Sheffer in Shadow of Doubt the other day and he did a good job in this film also. Nothing spectacular, but fair. This was only Anne Bobby's third film, and she was good also.The ending was spectacular and the rednecks got their just desserts, as did David Cronenberg. Ha!",1
2,"This Clive Barker catastrophe was based upon his book ""Cabal."" A cabal is a small group of secret plotters, as against a government or person in authority. Don't expect the movie to be about that.It's a Calgary, Canada crapfest that's somehow a freakish love story where a priest abandons his faith and a girl stabs herself in the stomach to join the ranks of the undead. Because, you know... love and crap. Dumbass YA's and the irrevocable decisions they make because they're too damn dumb to think long term.This pile of Canadian goose poo would have us believe that a doctor accompanies police to apprehend serial killers. And that the doctor, not the police would be the first to engage said killer. And that when the doctor shouts, ""He's got a gun!"" the police just unload everything they've got into said suspect.""Nightbreed"" was bad enough to make me catatonic with bewilderment at how dumb it all was. The Nightbreeds were monsters, or mutants, or some species of creatures that ranged from very human to very alien. They lived in a cemetery called Midian. What once was a closely guarded secret with no admittance allowed became a well-known nightclub with no security at the door.Because of a series of absurd events resulting in the main character, Aaron Boone (not the ex-NY Yankee) (Craig Sheffer), being dead and in jail, Midian became Hamburger Hill. It was the ""naturals"" versus the... unnaturals I guess... with the naturals having the edge with firepower and the Monstars (yes I'm making them a Space Jam basketball team) having the edge with mutant abilities.Boone leads the underground shapeshifters to victory, immortalizes his irritating shadow of a girlfriend, and fulfills his destiny. He was the Luke Skywalker of horrible horrors. Now, excuse me while I try to go purge my memory before I lose my mind.",-1
7,"A community of mutant outcasts of varying types and abilities attempts to escape the attention of a psychotic serial killer and redneck vigilantes with the help of a brooding young man who discovers them...What a strange interesting movie this oddity is.First off, the editing is really the poorest i have ever seen in a movie. One second, we see Boone about to talk to someone, next, it's obvious something prolific was said, but we never find out, hence making the film all the more confusing.Marketed as a slasher movie, Cronenberg is the most interesting character in the film, but he is a small fish in the Nightbreed pond compared to the characters we never get to learn more about.It's clearly evident that the characters who appear to have more going on in the world had more to do in the film than the finished product, which is frustrating.But as a standalone movie, it's fascinating to see such creations appear on screen, and the mythology we could have been given is there, but not in it's full glory.It has a very camp element to it, and Sheefer is good in his role, but Cronenberg steals the film as the sadistic doctor.Hopefully one day, the full 159 minute epic will be released, but for now, we will have to put up with this creation.",1
6,"Not that it is a really good movie or anything, it is an okay film that is rather interesting. I do not think I am going out on much of a limb when I say I am betting the book was better. Just a feeling I get, as this movie has parts of it where a viewer can get a bit lost. Plot points and key events seem to be missing from this film. It would have also been useful to know what certain characters were thinking, something you just can not do in a movie that you can do in the book. Still, the film was different and David Cronenburg was absolutely great as that weird doctor guy and by far the creepiest guy in the film which is rather good considering all the strange creatures there are in this movie. The story is hard to explain, a young man is seemingly called to his old cemetery. He believes he is becoming some sort of monster and this cemetery is home to these strange monsters that do have bite to them, but for the most part seem okay. They seem to have an entire city under the cemetery. There are all sorts to, though the porcupine one and the berserker ones stick out most in my mind. The doctor played by Cronenburg has strange motivations and the young man at the beginning copes with some strange changes. Like I said interesting enough, but it just seems to much was left out or something, or maybe it was a short story and to much was added in.",1
8,"When I heard last year that a new version of Nightbreed was coming out I was happy to finally see how this flick should be in stead of the mess it was made off when it came out. Clive Barker had nothing to say about the editing just before release. It was not done that monsters were the good thing and humans were bad. So nobody understood the earlier version and it was a big failure. 6 years ago Clive Barker was fed up with it all and tried to restore Nightbreed in it's original form. It was a hell, nothing was found. Mark Miller helped Clive to find the old stuff and contacted the fan base and yes, there it was, a 160 minute flick called the cabal cut. It was edited full with VHS parts that were almost not watchable. I have seen pieces and they knew that they couldn't bring it out that way so they contacted the studio's again and here it is, the director's cut clocking in at 120 minutes restored on Blu Ray, sadly only on region A but no probs for me, I have seen it and indeed this looks more like a flick.The effects used to make the nightbreed creatures are stunning and so typical Barker but some effects are also outdated and were used common at the end of the eighties. But still it's worth picking up. And now seeing it again, David Cronenberg (Dr Decker) was perfect in his role. Finally it's out there so do pick it up. Here and there you do see pixels due the upgrade towards 1080P but hey, finally Midian is back in full glory.Gore 1/5 Nudity 0,5/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",1
6,"Clive Barker's ""Nightbreed"" (based on Barker's novel ""Cabal"") is a disappointing horror film-especially in comparison to legendary ""Hellraiser""(1987).First of all there is not enough suspense or gore to satisfy horror fans.The sets are incredibly fake as are some of the monsters.However the cast is fine and David Cronenberg steals the show as a Dr.Phillip K.Decker.Check it out if you have enough time to kill...My rating:5 out of 10.",1
4,"I decided to watch the theatrical release version instead of the 'director's cut' and almost immediately wondered if I had made the right decision. As things progressed and more and more seemed to be happening from which I seemed to be dissociated I reckoned I had probably made the wrong decision. But then so unhappy was I with the comings and goings and the monster to monster shoulder rub and sly wink, I thought surely the shorter version was the way to go. The crux of the problem here is that Barker clearly wanted to reveal the terrible 'bad' monsters as good and the 'good' bad but this is a difficult trick to pull off especially with limited resources, a studio that just wants a straightforward hero and villain blockbuster and perhaps your own personal demons to be addressed. I can see why it seemed a good idea to have David Cronenberg playing it very straight and gentle but the inevitable contrast with the fantastical goings on is too great and in the end his character becomes yet one more obstacle to our getting involved. Would more back story have increased the viewers' involvement and understanding? I'm not sure but I tend to think that because of the immediacy and usually the inevitable simplicity of hero/villain situations it is difficult to try to come on too seriously. Regrettably, therefore, I'm tended to conclude that despite all the original ideas and good intentions this was, sadly, a deeply flawed project.",-1
6,"What heartache. Bursting with such innovation, atmosphere and intensity, it really loses out to the narrative's lack of ambition in exploring this mythological world by going down the same uneven route. What starts off unusually great (mainly the first half of the film with its eccentrically uneasy editing), goes onto fumble the absorbingly menacing impact and spontaneous psychological thrills generated, even though still keeping the passionate imagination alive. The second half doesn't try to disturb, but simply goes even more out of control, but follows a routine trend that sees gruesome carnage and a somewhat allegory on racism creeping in and of course the saying ""appearances can be deceiving"". Even the humour around these acts fell flat for me. The side-story involving David Cronenberg's clinically viper-like character (an excellently unnerving and placid performance that you can easily see what drew him to this project) became far more fascinating, than that of the monster realm 'Midian'. The monsters themselves are vividly brought to life with convincing, twisted features that truly stay in mind and the art direction had a pastel Gothic and nightmarish glow that seem to really give the grim atmosphere plenty of juice and an epic quality. Robert Vidgeon's agile photography work moodily set-ups each set-piece and Robert Elfman orchestrates a playfully airy, and eerie music score. Craig Sheffer is agreeable in the lead, and Anne Bobby is earnestly likable. Charles Haid, Doug Bradley and Hugh Ross appear in a very solid support cast. Adapted off Clive Baker's novel 'Cabel', Baker does a gallantly great job bringing it to life. I wasn't much of a fan of his film ""Hellraiser (1987)"", but I still admire his work and probably say this to be better. 'Nightbreed' is flawed, but there's too much creativity and colour that has to count for something.",1
2,"Clive Barker's 'Nightbreed' is a lavish, senseless horror film underpinned by a half-baked metaphysics. It's ""more is less"" plot features a psychopathic psychiatrist (unusually played by David Cronenberg, who has never directed a film as bad this one he appears in), a quasi-fascist police force and a bizarre ""community"" of undead monsters, all apparently living in the Cascade mountains. I say ""community"" in quotes as the supposed social dynamics of this group are never remotely plausible; instead, the film simply throws something new at us (a new monster, a new idea, a new enemy, a new place) at every turn of the plot, when just a fraction of the ingredients would have sufficed. It's not scary or funny, and having the monsters swear a lot renders them not frightening but banal. The film also has the most intrusive music of any movie I can remember. The result is a film with all the depth of a pop video; though sadly not the brevity.",-1
1,"I saw the movie in Costa Rica, the story seemed interesting but the director failed to keep the movie interesting, it was messy disorganized and boring, I feel that the movie did not go in the direction where it was easily understood or interesting, the plot was very weak and the ending was bad, bottom line is not worth watching not even in DVD, I saw it because I was curious to see a foreign film but this will not win any awards at all, it was awful say the least, the little girls did some good acting I will give them that. The movie was very basic and it failed to make the point of the film or the story that was told, this seemed more like a reality show than a movie.",-1
7,"I suppose that someone who is totally ignorant of the tragic history of Central America might find this film to be unintelligible and incomprehensible. However I found it to be absorbing. Those turbulent times produced tragic circumstances that families found themselves caught up in and forced to deal with as best they could. It is not a slick Hollywood production, but then it was never intended to be one.",1
8,"I was surprised by the level of enjoyment that ""Hajen som visste för mycket"" (The Shark That Knew Too Much) provides. It provides a perfect overall comment on society. Through an original, creative and funny story it mocks the world of money and looks. What lends endurance to this film is the comedy of which many alternating forms are used; physical, intelligent, sarcastic, silly - all forms original. Having watched other TV series and films by Galenskaparna, such as ""Macken,"" ""En Himla Många Program"" and ""Leif"" I was also surprised by the budget of this film; a lot of money and work has been used for stunts and special effects to make the film look more expensive than any of Galenskaparna's work I've seen. The story never halts or abates - it evolves at a fast pace throughout the film. It is somewhat of a musical, and as always the musical arrangements are impressive (regardless of the very late 80's overall sound.)",1
10,"Claes Eriksson, who created this movie, has said that of all his movies, this was the one he wasn't satisfied with. And perhaps all the strange relationships between all the odd characters is a bit confusing, but all the funny names and jokes alone, makes the movie worth seeing. And I know something you don't know...",1
2,"Some of the scenery was nice, but talking about Chaos that is the only asset I can say that was good about Chaos. Where Chaos really falls down on is the story. You sometimes are left wondering if there is any story at all and when there is it's lacking in any kind of sense. The idea with the circus could have been a good idea but never expanded enough upon, while the characters' motivations are foggy at best. On top of that the writing is banal and sometimes because of the low sound and line delivery incomprehensible. The stunts and such are unexciting and lacking in any kind of danger or heart. The characters are thinly sketched to the point that you are bored of them to care about them. The acting is literally a non-event as well.To put it in summing up, Chaos has some nice scenery but everything else makes the film overall a dull and truly chaotic mess. 2/10 Bethany Cox",-1
6,"When I saw the opening scenes of this movie I thought it was going to be a classic but as the increasingly preposterous plot unfolded i grew disillusioned. It's admirable in that, like _Alphaville_, _Zardoz_ and _minority report_ it tries to create a vision of the future that doesn't rely on Trickery, but it's view of where the current fascination with extreme sports might take us is seriously ill-judged. The plot is so full of holes that one often gets the impression that it was being made up as it went along.It's a pity, because there's some beautiful cinematography and some imaginative use of location, and a genuine interest in the consequences of European integration for Ireland",1
1,"What a turkey. I expected very little from this movie but even still it was a disappointment. The last movie I saw that made as little sense as this one was Eraserhead. The film is full of poorly fleshed out characters acting out of the foggiest motivations. The plot is barely there. The acting is a laugh. The film's biggest flaw though is its failure to appropriately depict the allegedly grand spectacle that is the Chaos metal circus. The whole movie hinges upon the massive success of the Chaos show, but all we ever get to see of it are a couple of half-assed motorcycle stunts and fight scenes in which nobody actually hits each other-- just a lot of yelling and then a close-up of a chainsaw throwing sparks off of metal. After the circus scenes were done I felt like I'd barely seen the show at all. After I watched the DVD, I viewed the ""making-of"" featurette for a clue that the filmmakers had an inkling that they were making a gigantic bomb. Nope! All I saw was repeated, laughable comparisons between Romeo & Juliet and the romance at the center of this piece of junk. Don't waste your time.",-1
5,"I purchased this movie from a local Big Lots for $3. I'm a big fan of The Road Warrior and Mad max. This movie labels itself as being similar. I would say that's a pretty slim comparison. As for the quality the sound can be a little low, and the quality is most definitely not on par with normal Hollywood features but it wasn't that bad either. The film centers around a main character who gets mixed up with a metal circus. Chaos ensues, one on one battles, back stabbing, and even a small love story thrown in for good measure. It was an OK film that I would watch again if I was feeling in a bit of a goofy mood, or even if I just wanted a background type of film playing. The movie wasn't amazing, but wasn't bad either. It's a fun B movie that a sci fi/apocalyptic fan might find a few interesting bits of. Worth the $3 I had spent ;)",-1
9,"The big prom night and definitely an episode to remember.Donna's mother is sure a horrible person. Wouldn't mind it if she will get killed off. Would have been better if it was her and not Dylan's dad. The scenes before prom are actually pretty good. While she is being nice to Donna and allows her to stay out, one can see how much she tortures Donna who has been under influence of her Christian prudishness all her life.Donna getting drunk and in trouble is also a pretty interesting part. They are not able to get her out on time and now we wonder how it will end.David was pretty cute in this episode, especially how much he wanted to try sex and his worries that they may forbid sex for prom nights.And Brandon and Andrea ending up in the hotel room! Will anything happen here?",1
10,"I'm not Jewish and no one in my family died in the Holocaust, but I feel the sense of horror at what happened and the little bit of relief that it might give the people who were touched by the extraordinary efforts done to capture the people that carried out these heinous crimes.I've actually watched the series a couple times and simply amazed at the dogged persistence of the people who wanted to try and get justice. It made me go and read further and it even more amazes me how they were able to do what they did.It is well researched and paced. There's a review that comments about some errors in what people were wearing, and yes like many shows there are some errors but I've found errors in almost every show. I didn't find those here to be overwhelming.",1
8,"Well put together series using both actors and historical films and stills. This is essential viewing for anyone who doesn't have good knowledge if the atrocities committed by Germany in WWII which should never be forgotten or forgiven. Illustrates just how pathetic virtually all the Nazis are after the war, hardly the master race they liked to think they were.",1
4,"With as much apparent research the producers did into the details of each of these Nazi series of events, you'd think they could get something like military rank insignia correct. They show actors described as key US Army Majors but wearing Captain bars. USA Colonels wearing 2 General stars. US Army NCOs in USMC uniforms.When a documentary doesn't get the simplest of things correct, I have a hard time taking for granted that the more obscure things are correct. All that research into the Nazis and they didn't do any research into ""What insignia would a Major have worn?"". Is there nobody on the production staff that's ever been in the military? Nobody who's ever watched the news or an (accurate) movie that might speak up and say ""Wait, I don't think that's right"".I hope that's all ten lines required. Seems like a silly requirement.",-1
1,"This is History from only a Jewish perspective. This series applauds illegal internal operations by the Moussad and the government of Israel that include forged passports, kidnapping, and murder of former Nazis and Nazi collaborators while it makes a blanket indictment of the Catholic church and all Catholics.People like Mengele are ""diabolical"" enough without having a biased, exaggerated script about them in something posing as a documentary.Just three of many obvious examples: After having heard of the kidnapping and murder of Adolph Eichmann, it is a ridiculous statement to make in this series that Mengele was ""paranoid"" while in Brazil after having fled Argentina in fear. 17:18Definition of paranoid: of, relating to, or suffering from a mental illness that causes you to falsely believe that people are trying to harm you.This series uses bland euphemisms to describe what had to have been torture of Eichmann by the Moussad to get the address of Mengele.Wiki says ""Mengele was a notorious member of the team of doctors"". This series makes you believe Mengele was solely responsible for the selection. If he was the one doing all the experiments on the twins he could not also be there at the trains when millions of Jews, gays, Gypsies, etc. were unloaded to select the fate of everyone. His deeds are bad enough that I wonder why the makes of this series feel the need to exaggerate it.The series says Mengele was narcissistic and that's why he did not get a tattoo that shows his blood type on his arm like all the other SS officers. Maybe he was just smart. They give no other proof as to why they believe he was narcissistic.We don't need yet another ""documentary"" that oversimplifies WWII history. We will never learn what makes people do these things if we always reduce them to caricatures.I would not have fallen for Hitler's BS as he was coming to power. Why should I fall for all this BS now?The ""experts"" in the series are full of people whose statements should be suspect: former Moussad agents, civilian Jewish Nazi hunters, authors like Guy Walters of unscholarly books about the Nazis wanting their 15 minutes of fame to promote book sales, people who were young children at the time who say they did not know what was happening because they did not speak German but who did not understand German but later claim they know complex statements things Mengele made verbatim because they knew enough German to understand that, and Gerald Posner, a former lawyer whose ""his two major career disappointments"" are that he could not get two of his books made into movies. They were not his books about the children of Nazis. He takes a very anti Arab stance after 911 wanting the blame the Saudi royal family for it.I tis customary industry practice for the producer to list all the cast. IN a documentary type production that would include any ""experts"" whose statements they include as well as any witnesses whose testimony they include. The only cast this IMDb lists for the Menegele episode is the narrator. Narrators just read a script verbatim into a microphone. If they had a list of the cast it would be too obvious that this sensationalistic explanation of historical events is related through a biased pool of witnesses and experts.""We thought Hollywood was doing documentaries instead of films""It's strange that they could not catch these most wanted of all Nazis for decades, if ever, and yet they claim to not only know every detail about everything that happened to them while they did not know where they were, they claim to have known what they felt. Words like bitter, depressed, etc. from 3rd party people who could not have known are descriptions of how Mengele felt. It is never explained how these people who were not witnesses to these things got the information.I the Eichman episode they never mention that Mengele thought of him as unimportant in the hierarchy but in the Mengele episode they mention it. Seems to me that would have been important to know mengele's opinion which had less reason for lying about Eichman. If so, it would condemn the Israeli government for kidnapping him and hanging him.The Paul Touvier episode says ""it does seem very fishy that everybody who helped the Nazis happened to be connected to the Catholic church""",-1
8,"There are two Italies. There's the romantic one the English portray where someone goes to Italy and finds the love, and there's the Italy you get from Italians, which is a pretty bizarre place. My Brilliant Friend takes place in Naples, a scuzzy city where the wealthy are criminals, women are barely human, and men are all just terrible.The story follows two girls, Lila and Elena, as the grow up in this disgusting world. Lila is effortlessly brilliant, but when her father refuses to allow her further education, she is outpaced by Elena, who gets to follow Lila's dream while Lila struggles to make her way in a world that will never accept her.The performances are terrific and the story is dramatic and compelling, but the movie is about as good for Italy's tourism industry as The Bicycle Thief. If this is Italy, I'll pass!",1
9,"My interests are slightly in the action/fantasy direction, but welcome all others. So the lives of two girls as they grow into young women in Naples, Italy in the '50s & '60s was not approached w/any great enthusiasm. More of, well let's see what this is about. I often ff movies that are so done-before-scripted, and was prepared to do the same here, but it was so engaging that I listened to every minute of the intelligent dialogue to the end. Kudos, well done to the location, acting (first time actors), script, props, cinematography & directing. My only puzzlement, contrary to what is written, is that (half way through final episode 8) while in the bathtub Lenu (Lila) says to Elana, ""You're my brilliant friend. You must become the smartest of them all. Boys and girls.""",1
8,"""My Brilliant Friend - The Story of a New Name"" (2020 release from Italy; 8 episodes of about 60 min. each) opens with ""Chapter 9 - The New Name"". We pick up exactly where the first season (and first book) left off, namely right after Lila's wedding to Stefano. On the way back from the wedding, Lenu and her (boy)friend Antonio get into a huge argument, but make up and... make out. Antonio raises the issue of marriage, but Lenu demurs. A few days later Lila and Stefano return from their honeymoon. When Lenu visits Lila (now Lila Carrucci--the new name) at the newlyweds' new apartment, Lila sports a black eye. In a flashback we learn what happened in the honeymoon... At this point we are 15 min. into the episode, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the TV adaptation of the second book of the 4 serial novels written by Neapolitan author Elena Ferrante. If you saw the first season, which aired in the Fall of 2018, you know EXACTLY what to expect: the continuing stories of BFFs Lila and Lenu. Given that this is a plot-heavy series, I am not going to say anything else about the story line besides what I described from the initial 15 min. (which sets the table for the remaining 7 3/4 episodes). Instead, let me point out that seemingly money was not an object, as we move into Napoli's 1960s. The Italians have always dressed super nice yet always cool, and this production reflects that, and then some. The cast is pretty much a no-names cast from the US' perspective, and when you have that many characters to follow, that actually works very well. Once again Max Richter has provided a rich instrumental orchestral score. In short, the second season looks to continue in the same high quality as was the first season, on all levels.""My Brilliant Friend - The Story of a New Name"" premiered this week on HBO and is not available on HBO on Demand and other streaming services. New episodes air Monday evenings at 10 pm (Eastern). I can't wait to see how the continuing story of Lenu and Lila will play out. If you are in the mood for a top-notch quality foreign TV series, I'd readily suggest you check this out and draw your own conclusion.",1
5,"The pace of this series lends itself to watching it only by visiting it intermittently. The series itself runs at a pace of molasses flowing uphill, and some of the scenes are so boring that one needs the use of a fast forward button to get through them. In those scenes there is no dialog, just a lot of staring at people and things! It really does not hold your interest as it becomes too dark and anguished....and no one does that as well as Italian cinema! Was not a favorite but did provide something to watch whenever the streaming queues were sparse.",-1
8,"I thoroughly enjoyed this first series of MY BRILLIANT FRIEND. The casting was a little awkward, matching up the young then the teenage actors, but the performances soon swept you along. (My only advice is keep track of the family units.) Complex story telling. Informative look at the working poor in the 50s and 60s post-war Italy. Some twists you don't expect, but an intimate look at friendship. Can't wait for series two next fall (possibility of 4 series that will follow the quintet of books). I give this first series an 8 (great) out of 10. {Drama}",1
10,"Remarkable coming of age story, very moving and caring. The two main characters are well written and realistic, could have been real people. Going in completely blind only knowing it's an HBO production, I didn't know what to think and I would compare it to Handmaid's Tale but now I see it's too different in a good way. The writing can't get any better, you cared for the characters after only an episode and after eight well written episodes with only important content we have seen a lot. With it being in Italian, the dialogue feels natural and immersive.
Everything, every scene is just gorgeous to look at, masterpiece!",1
8,"The 2 main characters, are played excellently by the 4 young actresses chosen for these roles that are newcomers to keep your eyes on in the future. Very, dark, gritty background almost devoid of light color and air, which pulls you into their world of dreaming of a better life and their aspirations to find happiness, which seems quite elusive despite their wonderful intelligence and bravery. Two young girls growing up in a small poverty stricken town, filled with violence and suppression of women. Both challenge each other, to move to a brighter future, like watching a game of chess between them as the years drag on, all the time wondering when it's over, will they still be friends? Can't wait for season 3.:D One of the best show from HBO since Carnivale. ;D.",1
10,"Seasons 1 & 2Season 1This Italian miniseries follows the friendship of Lenú and Lila, first as girls and then as teenagers / youth in a Naples suburb throughout the 1950s and early 1960s.The series articulates this relationship with the family and social environment of both in a very natural and effective way. A deep relationship between two very different girls: Lenú is introverted, conciliatory and studious while Lila has a privileged intelligence, is defiant and unpredictable, at times exasperating, becoming a very particular kind of femme fatal at times. A friendship with closeness, distance and occasional rivalries.They belong to families with women subjected to a violently patriarchal social framework with little interest in their intellectual and personal development, with family and clan, class and ideological rivalries and at some point subject to a Destiny typical of a very Mediterranean fatalism. And all taking place in that dusty neighborhood superbly photographed in sepia tone.Especially at the beginning, the period reconstruction and performances clearly refer to post-war Italian neorealism. Note that the characters speak in the Neapolitan dialect.Saverio Constanzo makes a magnificent, cinematographic direction, both in the intimate scenes and in the collective ones. The series is based on the first volume of the novel tetralogy Dos amigas, by the writer Elena Ferrante, whose text appears in the voice-over of an adult Lenú, from whose point of view the story is told.In addition to the very good performance of the two girls and the cast (with those mothers who seem like a reincarnation of Anna Magnani and an extraordinary Dora Romano as teacher Oliviero), the magnificent performances of Margherita Mazzucco and Gaia Girace stand out, as Lenú and Lila adolescents and young, respectively, each immersed in her own particular melancholy . Each viewer will surely choose one of both characters as his favorite.In addition to combining very well and with a romantic spirit all the dimensions of this narrative (psychological, social, historical), the series at many times knows how to beat with a deep and unprecedented emotionality, underlined by the great soundtrack by Max Richter, harmonically based on the theme La Follia, a favorite of many Baroque composers.Without a doubt, one of the best series of 2018.Season 2English ReviewContains references to Season 1Season 2 of My Brilliant Friend (based on A Bad Name, the second novel of Elena Ferrante's tetralogy) continues with the encounters and misunderstandings of the friends Lenu and Lila, the first with her patient and tenacious path of academic training and passion. and enterprising Lila immersed in the family trap of her marriage to Stefano, agent of a deceptive prosperity and that of the suburb in which she always lived. In both cases, omnipresent the patriarchal matrix that seeks to elegantly discourage the first and subdue the second with daily violence.The love rivalry between the two erupts within the framework of the paradisiacal Ischia, in scenes of great beauty and suggestion (directed by Alice Rohrwacher and that makes us understand the bourgeois character of what we call adolescence, a territory to be conquered by women who pass from the childhood to adulthood nonstop). The Italian political scene of the 60s and the differences between northern and southern Italy are present and evident.The series retains all its emotional power and even doubles it, enveloping us with its incredible period reconstruction. Of course, certain topics appear in other fictions, but always the approach of the directors Saverio Costanzo and Alice Rohrwacher (and of course, Ferrante) and the wonderful performance of their cast (led by Margherita Mazzucco and Gaia Girace, two authentic teenagers born in 2004 and with an astonishing interpretive maturity) give them an absolutely original depth and sobriety.",1
9,"One season in this is a magnificent production that paints an incredibly vivid portrait of the lives of two girls from their early childhood in post war Naples to their growth into young women. I find it deeply moving in parts. My own mother grew up as one of three children in a poor family in the north of England during this era and whilst local gangsters were less of an issue!, the abject poverty and complete lack of opportunity for working class people, particularly women, resonates completely. She was the brightest in her class but her only option on leaving school was the local slipper factory. Most people under 40 don't realise how bad it was back then. Very few films or tv series have showcased the importance of education as strikingly as this series does and it's a reminder that we all need at a time when governments across the world are pricing the current generations out of education once again. That this piece works so well is obviously partly due to the brilliant writing but it is brought to life by four stunning performances from the 4 young actresses who play Elena and Lila as children and young women. Margherita Mazzucco just about edges it - she can convey the equivalent of a paragraph of verse via a particular look and a couple of words, but all 4 are exceptional. Dora Romano is also fabulous as the teacher who is desperate to help the girls fulfil their potential and who reminded me of a great teacher that I had who saw some potential in a boy in her class. There isn't really a weak link in the wider cast either. You really get invested in all the characters and yearn for Elena and Lila in particular to escape to a place where they can flourish. The stunning cinematography is also worthy of high praise here. There is a scene where Elena rides a bus through Naples and you really believe you are there in the 1950's and the scenes in Ischia are breathtaking. Finally, it's all accompanied by a fabulous score from Max Richter. In short, this is one of the most promising tv series of recent years and I just hope that it keeps up this great high standard.",1
6,"It tries very hard to be arty and thought-provoking and utterly fails. It's mostly really boring in the super-long shots of scenery, etc. The narrator/author presents a portrait of Lila that is insipid, vapid, and narcissistic and in doing so, reveals herself to be all those things.",1

(i think Ludovica Nasti and Elisa del Genio),the two again unbelievable main
protagonists Margherita Mazzucco and Gaia Girace,of course Elena Ferrante,
and to all the crew and members of this magnificent accomplishment.",1
10,"This is one of the best shows I have ever experienced. It takes place in Naples Italy from the early 1950s and onwards following the lives of two best friends Lili and Elena as they progress in their lives. The storyline is gripping and captivating. The characters are so interesting authentic yet complex and nuanced. The rendition of Italy in the 50s and 60s is so fantastic. Attention to all details is absolutely perfect. This is poetry and on a totally different level in comparison to most other good shows today. This series deserves much much more attention. I am so happy that I found this gem. Do yourself a favour and put this show on top of your list. You will be happy you did, I guarantee! I have seen most of the major series so I know what to compare with ( see my other reviews for a reference) Wow what an excellent series this is! Perfection.",1
10,Rarely have I seen a series that has amazed me recently more that My Brilliant Friend. The style and pacing reminded me of Call Me By Your Name (2017) as the pacing serves as a slow but purposeful look into a female friendship that feels intimate and raw while the style feels pleasing with gorgeous shots and colors.,1
7,"But as the 2nd drags on, we lost interest.
it becomes too dark for too long.
Great players and story.
Looks great.",1
8,"Its not a tv series, its a saga. It will keep you engrossed & each character will become your personal concern. Very well made & source material is of high calibre. Must watch tv series in my opinion.",1
10,"Breathtaking drama, with remarkable attention to detail. Naples never looked so stunning. The central performances, especially Lenu are so captivating to watch. Loved it!",1
1,"MY BRILJANT FRIEND is being introduced to the public as a truly art- series, based on an italian bestseller series of books by Elena Ferrante, and so a lot of film critics are talking (or rather blabbering!) about how good it is and how artistic and wonderful they find the series and all that stuff. . . well . . .tss. . .OK maybe i don't get it . . . that's possible but i DO like independent and art movies and so i was immediately interested in the series . . but now it seems that i was totally misled by all the good reviews here on IMDb. . .With this review i want to give a totally different view on the series (please note that i only saw season 1 and i haven't read the book!).
I find the series not the least bit interesting or artistic, but rather very superficial, largely melodramatic and sometimes even hilarious (and absurd!) in a ridiculous kind of way, rather unemotional and, last but not least: very, very, very slow-paced and boring.
When i say unemotional it is because one never gets the full reasons or even any explanation about why things happen. For instance why does (the infant) Lila throws the dolls in the cellar, or why doesn't she wants to win the school contest with the boys, or why does she throws rocks to Nino etc etc. . ?One never gets a any insight in the emotions of the characters and so never fully understands why they act as they do (is it frustration, jealousy, mere stupidity or what? . . ? ).I suppose in the book it all makes sense because all emotions are given or probably even thrown at the reader; but as a viewer of the series one can only guess of course . . but anyway . . . it's all-in the dark and it makes it all over the top melodramatic and thus sometimes even absurd.And of course with countless horse-drawn carts, period vehicles and extras like the incessant repetition of women and men screaming, overwhelming explicit violence, and numerous misunderstandings to fill the stage, our attention is often distracted from the story itself.
The casting was rather mediocre: only the two youngest actrices were extremely good in their roles (especially Elisa del Genio as young Elena!); the rest of the actors didn't match up with them.By the time the season concluded, I was bored by the slow pace of the show, utterly disappointed by the overall acting and sometimes very confused by the complex storytelling of this chronicle of poor people in post-war Italy in the 1950s.Conclusion: I wanted to give it a 3 or 4; but because of to the undeserved very high IMDB rate, i decided to give it a 1 ! . .And i am not the least interested in seeing the next season!",-1
10,"Such a tender and at the same time cruel story! Well, what would you expect when we are talking of one taking place in times of sheer poverty, as the case almost everywhere in Europe was after the W. W.2, in a place famous for its beauties and notorious for its ""peculiarities"": Naples, Italy! And not just Naples, but a poor suburb of the city, populated in general by hardworking and honest, yet backward -very conservative if you prefer- and sometimes very stubborn and tough people. The story line is developed in a most natural, unpretentious way and everything illustrated in it, characters, situations, setting etc looks as honest as in the classical neorealistic italian films of the 50s. And just as the sentimental power of films like De Sica's ""Il ladro di biciclette"" springs from the pure honesty and truth of the bitter story they tell, so in ""L'amica geniale"" is its truth and honesty that make me often cry watching it, and not any cheap or less cheap dramatic scenes trying to evoke emotion. In other words, its enormous emotional power is due to its honesty and truth, to waking up memories of a past common to a huge number of people just by honestly retelling and reminding it, in other words its tremendous emotional power is something you will find ""between the lines"" so to say, and not to any ""melodrama"" if you see what i mean.For me, a man brought up not too far from the place where the story is being developed, not long after the period this story takes place and in a more quiet and peaceful yet in many other ways not too different environment, - and that is a neighborhood in Piraeus, Greece,- my identification with the characters of the story is inevitable, hence the shocks of emotion it makes me feel . After all, the name of the main character is Greco! Helena Greco. Let alone the place itself which ""feels"" by history and name as greek as it gets! Napoli-Neapoli =Newcity!",1
10,Thank you HBO for bringing this series to the USA and going ahead with the second season. Not since the epic Italian classics of the 1960s has life in Italy been brought to the screen with such beauty and characters. All four of the lead girls are fantastic.. As an Italian American it is great to see a slice of life non shoot em up mafia series.. viva hbo please plug it more in your ads. richard,1

When I watched the second series...I don't think there was an episode I didn't cry...look at the acting of Lena,her torture,of her best friend falling for the man she loves
Lila being superior,intellectually to everyone else...
But Lena...so beautiful ...
So beautifully acted...
This series is one of those special ones,that we really underestimate but should be revered🙏",1
10,From the first episode I was hooked. Definitely one of the best series I have ever watched.Highly recommend it to everyone. Now I am reading the 4 books.,1
8,"Base of novel, this screenplay is really good. Two young girls make you sit and watch their interesting roles. For the First 8 episodes, i enjoy from all parts. And there is not anything bad about it. I am waiting for next episodes, and eager to watch it.",1
10,"🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 In horizontal comparison, Elena was lucky. She didn't seem to get the scumbag's favor, and she violently abandoned herself. In fact, Nino gave Elena a chance to regenerate, allowing her to leave freely. Naples, imagine that if Nino didn't let it go, Elena would most likely become the finale of Lena's copy: pregnancy was abandoned. So Elena is lucky, she has good-will guidance, and also has the opportunity and family environment support to leave Naples.Beauvoir said in ""Second Sex"": The great luck of a man is that he, whether in adulthood or childhood, must embark on a very difficult road, but this is the most reliable road; women 'S misfortune lies in being surrounded by almost irresistible temptations; she is not required to work hard and is encouraged to slide down to reach Bliss. When she found out she was fooled by Mirage, it was too late, and her power was exhausted in a failed adventure.",1
10,"I didn't get hooked on the first episode, but I continue watching and loved it. A breathe of fresh air Powerful yet simple. Wish movies were as creative as this one. In a world full of special effects without true and profound content, this simple yet original series is simply perfection",1
10,"A breath-taking storytelling that takes you by storm.
Superb in all senses.
Jaw-dropping acting, exquisite, unprecedented cinematography and an ode to friendship and society underdogs that leaves you in awe.
Its flawless narration, turns you numb and craving for more.
Unfortunately I have not read the books yet, but the series is absolutely sensational. Sorrentino turns everything into motion poetry. A perfect Ten!",1
7,Cast and acting was soo impressive eventhough the actors were new faces to auditions...the story was affective even the screenplay is soo slow..samuthirakani and sunaina acted soo well as a couple with kids..,1
8,"4 short films very loosely linked with one after another but all of them are about love, life and everything in between a couple.
A wonderful, nice, feel-good film after 96.
Cab ride-sharing, Amazon's Alexa 👌
Samuthirakani well used after his first venture (Read: no social-message/advice) 👏
Finally, beautiful Sunaina after a very long time 😍",1
6,The movie is an anthology of 4 stories of love and affection at different stages of life. It boldly speaks of taboo subjects. There is no interconnection between the 4 stories and characters from other stories appear as only strangers in current story. Kudos to the director for portraying seemingly difficult subjects with such an ease!! A good watch in Netflix.,1
8,"I am surprised to watch such a feel-good movie which released last year.This is one of the best in 2019.Go and watch it, dont skip this wonderful movie!",1
9,"The first and the last stories were home runs. Very very relate-able.
While the first story was pure fiction, the forth one was very close to everyday life. Yet both landed right into my heart.The third story did not resonate as much but still felt pretty honest. The second story was pretty good too.The actress in the forth story stood out as the best performer in the movie.All in all, it is a beautiful anthology. Recommended.",1

The film rarely deviates from its tonality.
Music by Pradeep Kumar, in this film and the others, paints the greys of the story in yellows and pinks-quite in tune with the purpose of these films.

you upsee the mark, I feel like a part of me is missing. This kids love story reminded me the writing of Tagore's "" Saisava Geethi "" Mahej Bins "" Street children's ""
the unknowing purity they has in each thing they do !KAAKAKADI (No more tears) : an unlikely love story that occurs through cab rides and conversations. The jokes are a bit hit and miss in this film-like that Tabu-taboo wordplay or the done-to-death cancer-Cancer !

Pink Bag - 1st story
the eagerness to find the girl and gives the ring which she misses, but it talks the innocent purest form of love.Kakka Kadi - 2nd story An absolute treat where the love is defined from a matured girl's perception, and simply love the chemistry between the two actors. love beyond humans and within a man and woman from unexpected. But the ride is light hearted and fills you will positivity.
Turtle - 3rd story Dignified. The story has this old aged widower falling for an unmarried old woman, over their turtle walk. The 'Inji tea with added Dignity' is sure going to stick to your mind forever.
Belonging'- 'Be-Longing' for the love of your life.
Hey Ammu - 4th story
Samudhrakni and Sunaina, just steal your heart with their 12 years of marriage, 3 children and their ignorance on what real love is.
The married couple, this is what most of us do, this was really conveyed well. When we love its just love, later its Love + Responsibility. This takes the diversion in one's live. This shows, the emotions and a little caring that leads to unconditional love.
The total credit goes to the director Halitha Shameem. Her sense of humor and perception on Love reflects through the entire movie.
Pradeep Kumar bgm to this movie is cake for this film. Must watchable.",1
8,"Picking a movie from a list of Netflix is like opening a box of chocolates. ""You never know what you gonna get!..."" I was pleasantly surprised by my choice. Sometimes it is the movie unheard of with an equally unfamiliar cast may be the one with the most exciting storyline.This movie is an anthology of four unrelated stories with love being the common theme. Its four stories try to show that the emotion that releases butterflies in the tummy, the special feeling called love, at different age groups. Love needs are different at various times of one's life, and it carries a different meaning at other periods of their lifetimes.The first story revolves around teens and love blossoms in the most unromantic place of all, the city dumpster. A slum-boy who scavenges the trash comes across some greeting cards, memorabilia and a photograph of a young girl. Curious how the girl would be in real life, he follows the garbage trump to get a peek at the owner. In summary, it is puppy love. Looking at the apparent disparity in social class and education levels of both, the viewers can guess the relationship would go nowhere.The next one is the love of the contemporary kind, involving all modalities considered modern. There is the current Chennai landscape complete with spanking new highways and clean Hyundai cars, Ole call cab service, modern private medical centres and social media. Here a young man in his early 30s, who is all excited in anticipation of tying the nuptial knots with his gal that he found on an online matrimonial page, is diagnosed with testicular cancer. His beau bolts and he has to deal with the ailment on his own. Love is found again in strange places; this time in the form of a fellow occupant of a shared cab. Love blossoms by being an anchor weathering the storm.
The third story is about love in the twilight years. The traditional way of Indian life would dictate that those senior years of experience is the opportune time to prepare for the ethereal world. Not so in the modern world, it seems. Loneliness and fairly robust health necessitate romantic liaisons, especially when the offsprings are nowhere around to be seen.
The final clip is about love in contemporary times. After years of marriage, the spark that drew the couple together is somewhat missing. Husband and wife just carry on life doing their society-sanctioned duties without giving second thoughts to the amorous need of the other. Life, as each knew it, was the repetitive action of working at home or office, caring for the needs of kids and being trapped in the quagmire of the cycle of repetition. Remedy comes through the cupid work of a modern AI device.Love, as they say, makes the world to stay relevant. At the spring of adolescence, with the raging of hormones, the youths think with their impulse. Nature needs them to be amorous. Progeny has to happen. The young cannot be wasting time in critical thinking and analysing. Continuity of the species is of paramount importance.It used to be a time when society, which used to be patriarchal, dictated how the female species were left with no choice but conform to assume their role in society. With female empowerment came reduced fertility and threat of extinction. Nature fought back. Love had to bloom somehow, and it does.It is love that holds a family and a society together. Left to their own devices, Man can be self-centred with their 'selfish gene' taking charge. The weak and the old would be left to rot. Hence, love manifest as compassion to care for the ones left behind in the race of time. Even the participants at the twilight stage of their years need someone to ride into the sunset...",1
6,"I had heard a lot of positive reviews about this movie, before watching it, but after watching it, was not able to understand, why it got such a review? It was a movie with 4 stories, but did not like story couple of them at all probably because of the cultural changes it portrays in movie, however liked 4th one very much and acting of Sunaina was too good in that! Overall felt like having watched a short film, rather than full length movie!",1
8,"In the conservative and commercial Tamil cinema industry, not often a film worthy of critical acclaim gets produced but when such a film gets produced and released, as audience we are all deemed to embrace and appreciate it, for we are the ones who wish to see more films like it.In such case, Sillu Karupatti is a seemingly sweet film with deep rooted ideas embedded into it, to loosen this society a little bit. Comparing it with some other language films and trying to bring it down is unnecessary. For what you've paid the price, Sillu Karupatti is worth of it.Like a tender breeze, past our hearts, having seeded it with love and tolerance, Sillu Karupatti passes by as audience leave the film with change and fulfillment.",1
9,"Sillu Karupatti is an anthology of four stories each featuring people from different age groups. Though the first story, does not have as much impact as the others, it sets the stage for them. The second story featuring a guy with testicular cancer falling in love with a girl who he meets during a car pool ride, is handled deftly by the director. The director does not make crude jokes about his condition. She knows where to draw the line. The fourth one is my favourite. A husband and wife rediscovering their love for each other. At one point, the wife confesses to her Alexa speaker that she needs meaningful sex and not the one where her husband goes to sleep immediately afterwards. This shows the maturity of the director in approaching a topic which is still considered a taboo in India. The third story is about finding your soul mate even after the sixties. This movie will surely satisfy you and leave you with a smile on your face.",1
10,Try to do some different thing from normal tamil cinema and I can say it worked well. Four love stories running the film and they are so matured. All cast did a great job even kids and specially Samuthirakani. I'm looking forward see these kind of movies from tamil cinema again and again!,1
8,"A very good movie in which different stages of love is portrayed soo well and it's Soo much interesting to watch each stories it tells about love in the ,teenage , old , after marriage, and in between youngsters. It shows what true love is and gives us a message it was a nice feel good movie . And it will entertain you for sure",1

PS -Thanks @NetflixIndia",1
1,Kind of over hyped . It is a decent movie with a good work from cinematographer . I am not keeping the other Tamil movies as yardstick but when comparing with world class cinemas the characters feel artificial and dialogues feel forced .Despite its flaws any day I would watch this movie rather than watching sum masala crap .,-1

10,"Everything holds a vibe.Even Artforms.Beyond logical perception some magical creations touch our soul deeper, which is very hard to define in words.Especially when it fills you with all love and love.
I m going to try that hard part now.I know my words can do least justification to that wonderful experience of this movie, an anthology of four films.But expressing my inner experience with this movie itself like drenching in the ocean of love and bliss.I want to relive that amazing experience by writing here.
When this movie got released,my social media flooded with wonderful positive reviews which was intriguing. But i coudnt watch it immediately. Destiny has its own plan.Whenever i entangled with some serious life situations.I prefer to travel which will set things straight to me. It was a tough day which made me emotionally drained. Started my car for an unplanned drive.With all complex thoughts and emotions i reached a multiplex in a city. Its late evening and i m not in a mood for a movie as i felt exhausted.
While having food glimpsed the movies running in the Mulitiplex.I never watch a movie if i m unsettled. But my instinct directs me to go for it.I stepped in with a blank mind and Drained emotions.Then the miracle started happening gradualy.The essence of the movie which is love filled me completely. I could resonate with every bit of energy that movie holds.I can write a lot and lot about every frame and Characters of the movie with story line. But whole heartedly i want everyone should watch this movie as it is without any spoilers and prejudgements.If any missed this movie till now, I would say its an opputunity to fill yourself with hope and light with numerous dimensions of love with four poetic stories.Only few creator can fill life in their creations and that will fill light and love in you.Writer of this film may used a magic wand while weaving this artform.Every bit of this movie holds Life Breath.Sufi mystics says, their essence of truth are between then space betweem their words. Real musicians fills Silence in between the sounds. Similarly this movie holds the Soul of the Director which reflects as a whole in those invisible connecting dots between all four stories. True meaning and purpose of this movie exists between those four creations. Its natural that any one could connect to the creator for the movie or even may fall in love with the creator without knowing who it is. Because its a healing for many supressed souls and anything which heals will make a person to feel grateful.Blessings not needed to be a word. A healed heart bless with its silence of fullfillment.
This is not just a movie, its an eternal nectar.!",1
8,This movie changed my life.8/10 for lateness of the sequel,1
10,"Wonderful showing of the hero's journey, with relatable characters, fantastic editing, and an amazing climax. I legit cried the first time I watched it.

5,"Jaclyn Smith is a professor at a Midwestern university. When her husband is killed in an accident, she feels adrift and accepts an appointment as ambassador to Rumania, hauling her young daughter (Ari Meyers) along. It's a tough job. I mean -- who knows anything about Rumania? It sounds a little like a mental illness. ""I think he has a touch of Rumania."" Smith must learn to speak Rumanian, which is at least a Romance language descended from Latin, like French, Italian, and Spanish, but is after all pretty historically remote from its source. Then, in Bucharest, she meets her chief aid, a cocky, unshaven Robert Wagner, who quickly straightens up and flies right. She also meets a simpatico Christopher Casanove, who is working for the wrong side, unknown to her. R. J. Wagner straightens THAT problem out pronto. There's a lot of intrigue, which I won't go into.Jaclyn Smith, her daughter, and just about everyone at the American embassy is being stalked by an assassin known only as ""Angel,"" whom the novel describes as ""fat, ugly, and stupid."" (The part was offered to me for reasons I can't imagine.) The victims are to be blown up at an embassy party. I won't disclose the means. The climactic chase and resolution involves the Marine embassy guards and the explosion is prevented by Skylight Ex Machina.What's most impressive about the film, aside from Jaclyn Smith's supernal beauty, is the way the director and photographer have turned Wilmington, North Carolina, into Bucharest. (They didn't do such a hot job of turning Wilmington into Kansas. Nobody could.) Wilmington, a charming, relaxed Southern town, really LOOKS like Rumania. An old warehouse down by the docks is convincingly turned into an infamous prison. There are enough old mansions scattered around that it must have been easy to pick one of particular splendor to serve as the embassy.The Marine guards were real Marines, recruited from nearby Camp Lejeune, where I taught night classes. Nice guys too. Many of the guests at the embassy party were genuine ethnics. The guy in the Arab head dress was ethnically Arab, for instance. The background persons were asked to speak in foreign languages if they could. I was teamed with a young French woman and, conversationally, rattled off the lyrics to ""Chevalier de la Table Ronde,"" adding what I thought was an appropriately fatalistic Gallic shrug from time to time. ""I haven't heard zat seence I was a child,"" she said. I suppose many others were doing the same thing.As a miniseries, it doesn't lack for pace. It's exotic-looking, mysterious, exciting, and pretty propulsive.",-1
8,"Where to begin. This is wonderful TV miniseries thriller another gem from the decade of the American tv miniseries. The 1980s. Full of plot twists and turns. Wonderfully paced and acted, Its two one and a half hour episodes. But there is not a single boring moment to be had. You can watch it in one three-hour sitting and the time will go very quickly. Jaclyn Smith is one of the best American actresses of that decade the 1980s. She shows her considerable talent and beauty in spades. Jaclyn Smith was not on the big screen so much but most of her work was done on the tv movies on the small screen. I saw her excellent performance as Florence Nightingale in the TV movie from 1985 of the same name. By this time she is a mature performer. Robert Wagner was also very good in this. But Jaclyn Smith stole the show and lit up the screen in every scene she is in. I will be checking out her other work from this decade on television as I am very impressed by her as a performer. You can catch this mini series on DVD. Or if you are lucky you could be channel surfing one day and you can pick it up on cable television. Watching this tv miniseries with Jaclyn Smith in the lead role is time well spent in front of the box.",1
7,"Boris Karloff was a wonderful actor and amazing guy--especially since he kept appearing in films well after death! If you check IMDb, you'll see three films that all came out AFTER he died in February, 1969. This film, while released in the UK in 1968 was released in the US in 1970--making it a fourth post-mortem film Karloff made! Much of the reason for this is that late in life the man made a ton of ""guest appearances"" in cheesy horror films, since he was a big name and apparently would work for little money. A few of these late appearances, like TARGETS, were exceptional films and many, like CHILDREN OF BLOOD, were cheap Mexican productions that should have embarrassed Karloff. I can only assume he really, really needed the money as he was confined to a wheelchair for many of these films--though he could walk about a bit if needed.CRIMSON ALTAR is a post-death film that falls between the bad ones and the exceptional ones. It has the benefit of good supporting acting from Christopher Lee but isn't as original or cool as TARGETS (a very under-appreciated classic) but is a genuinely chilling and interesting tale about witchcraft.The film begins with a witch trial back in the good old days. After the witch is roasted to a crackly perfection, the scene switches to the present time. A man is concerned because his brother was visiting a town (the same one that held this witch trial) and has disappeared, so he goes there in search of clues. And, naturally, given the cast, it isn't surprising when it turns out that there is a cult that worships this dead witch and they are responsible for the brother's disappearance.The film has many red herrings--false leads and twists. Many of them are very good, though the end almost seemed like it was concocted at the last minute. Still, there were enough chills and excitement to merit watching this film--particularly if you are a fan of Karloff or Lee.By the way, get a look at the guy with antlers and a leather thong, the goat-man as well as the sexy green witch! You just have to see them--trust me.",1
5,"The cast were the source of interest for Curse of the Crimson Altar in the first place. The film though doesn't see any of the cast at their best and doesn't do them justice. That said Curse of the Crimson Altar is far from terrible. The cinematography and settings are appropriately eerie, and the music gives a real sense of creepiness. Three members of the cast shine. Boris Karloff is even when ill and late in his career commanding and acerbic. Christopher Lee is similarly wonderful and has a character that suits him to a tee. And Barbara Steele is wonderfully wacky and sensual, her costume and make-up are a knockout. Mark Eden however is a monotonously bland lead, and Virginia Weatherell while very pretty is lacking in charisma too. Michael Gough does deserve credit for doing shifty so convincingly, sadly he's woefully underused, and that's pretty much the same with Rupert Davies. While the film doesn't look so bad visually, the special effects do look rather cheap. The script is a complete muddle, it has some amusing lines from Karloff but too much of it is cheesy and severely underwritten. The story drags quite badly and even for a short running time feels on the thin side, complete with an ending that is both under-explained and dramatically undercooked. The dream sequences did come across as hilariously weird too, and the direction is rather flat and doesn't do anything to make the film less dull and muddled. Overall, not a terrible film but a strange one, somewhat difficult to rate this time around. 5/10 Bethany Cox",-1
6,"Peter Manning joins a demonic cult. His brother Robert is desperate to find him. The brothers are partners in dealing antiques. He follows Peter to Craxted Lodge at Greymarsh which is celebrating witches' night. He finds Eve Morley being chased by four men which turns out to be a game. There's a wild party at the lodge. Eve's uncle Mr. Morley (Christopher Lee) runs the place. Professor John Marsh (Boris Karloff) warns Robert of the darker occult and Lavinia Morley (Barbara Steele) who is a long ago ancestor.It's a British B-horror. It does have post-Hammer Lee and the legendary Karloff. The movie is self-aware enough to make a Boris Karloff joke. This is one of his last films and he is dead a few months after its UK release. Despite sitting down, he is still charismatic enough to hold the screen. The cult costumes are cheesy and crazy and fun. The effects are cheesy. This is undeniable in the B-movie category. It's a standard guy-uncovering-cult story despite the weirdness. The movie has a bit of S&M fun during the weird cult stuff but it does stall in the blander parts. It's worth a watch for late Karloff and the cheesy cult costumes.",1
4,"Mark Eden shows up at an old country home, looking for information on his missing brother. Owner Christopher Lee -- in what he claims was his worst movie -- tells him he's never heard of the man. Since the place is having a local festival, all the rooms at the local pub or booked, so he invites him to stay at the house, remarking it's the sort of place that one would expect to see Boris Karloff. After Lee's daughter, Barbara Steele, shows him to his room, Karloff shows up in a wheelchair, and we're off to the races.It's a rather incoherent, uncredited version of Lovecraft's The Dreams In The Witch House, most notable for its cast, which includes Michael Gough, than for anything else, although cinematographer John Coquillon shoots the dark interiors.",-1
5,"No sooner has Mark Eden predicted that Karloff would pop up in the creepy mansion he's visiting (searching for his brother who disappeared after sending him a note on the castlesc stationary) than he does! The wheelchair bound Karloff, having haunted more houses than actual ghosts, is a minor supporting charachter here, playing a castle resident who is a historian, he claims, of the past, present and future, and gives Eden both facts and warnings about the evening he's spending there. Having already joined forces with fellow horror film legends Bela Lugosi, Vincent Price, Peter Lorre, Basil Rathbone and Lionel Atwill, now shares the screen with two other legends of the genre, Christopher Lee and Michael Gough.While Lee and Karloff are top billed, the real lead is Eden, walking in on a yearly ceremony surrounding the burning death of witch Barbara Steele, seen here in flashbacks and nightmares as the green body painted , horn helmuted evil enchantress. She haunts Eden as he tries to solve the mystery of his brother's disappearance, with Gough claiming that the brother is dead. This isn't so much scary as it is erotic, utilizing gratuitous nudity to sell seats. Virginia Wetherell gets to bare quite a bit as Lee's niece, aiding Eden and accused of betraying the family which obviously has its share of secrets. A fairly spooky atmosphere makes this only slightly more interesting with a potentially eerie plot that really goes nowhere and concludes with a weak finale.",-1
6,"Robert Manning (Mark Eden) searches for his vanished brother in a rural English village, where he is entangled in the legend of Lavinia (Barbara Steele), a witch killed 300 years ago. Lavinia's heir, J. D. Morley (Christopher Lee), wants revenge on anyone related to her killers, such as Robert. Robert romances Morley's niece, Eve, and is aided by occult expert Prof. Marsh (Boris Karloff), but it is up to him to repel Morley's evil designs.Boris Karloff became ill with pneumonia while shooting this project in the freezing rain. It was his last British feature, begun January 22 1968, and he would recover enough to shoot four Mexican features in May 1968, his final screen work. Barbara Steele is always a treat, and she is especially interesting with green skin and a large, feathery hat (if you can call that a hat).Loosely based off of H. P. Lovecraft's ""Dreams in the Witch House"", how does it stack up to the Stuart Gordon version forty years later? Honestly, you cannot even compare them. If there is a connection, it is very limited. There is a witch, there are dreams, but the two films are worlds apart.Howard Maxford calls the film ""dated and somewhat slow"", having ""a better cast than it deserves"". How a film that runs only 87 minutes can be slow is a legitimate question. Ivan Butler also feels the film falls short, saying the ""promise of a combination of Lee, Karloff and Barbara Steele is not fulfilled"". These are fair assessments.I recommend the film for the cast and the awesome organ track that opens the film. Beyond that, it is hit and miss and you could skip it.",1

6,"Antiques dealer Robert Manning (Mark Eden) travels to the remote village of Greymarsh in search of his missing brother Peter, who was last seen at a country lodge belonging to Mr. Morley (Christopher Lee), descendant of local witch Lavinia (Barbara Steele, looking a bit like the Tretchikoff print my mum used to have hanging in her living room) who was burnt at the stake. '60s horror titans Lee and Steele are joined by old-school favourite Boris Karloff in this exploitative effort from Tigon Studios that lacks a decent plot but which compensates somewhat with a few exploitative elements, including debauched young revellers, mild torture perpetrated by a muscleman in leather briefs and a stag antler helmet, and a spot of gratuitous nudity (bum and boobs) courtesy of Virginia Wetherell, who plays Morley's vivacious niece Eve.Storywise, the film feels like it was made up on the go, the plot lurching from one scene to the next with little regard for logic (Michel Gough, as mentally retarded butler Elder, provides several pointless moments before inexplicably turning up dead), but with its incredible triumvirate of genre greats and all of its campy schlock horror ingredients, the film is such a silly slice of Satanic nonsense that it is hard not to enjoy just a bit.",1
6,"I'll be perfectly honest. This could have been the worst movie ever made and you put Barbara Steele in green body paint and I'll watch it anyway. Luckily, it's a pretty great movie.Director by Vernon Sewell (The Blood Beast Terror) and written by Mervyn Haisman (Dr. Who, Jane and the Lost City) and Henry Lincoln (who wrote The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, which Dan Brown completely ripped off to make The DaVinci Code, as well as one of the main researchers into Rennes-le-Château and an honorary Militi Templi Scotia knight in recognition of his work in the fields of sacred geometry and Templar history), this movie piles on the occult and I couldn't love it anymore for that fact. Or that it was based on ""The Dreams in the Witch House"" by H. P. Lovecraft.Antiques dealer Robert Manning is looking for his brother, who has gone missing after visiting their family's ancestral home in Graymarsh. He arrives in the middle of a party - people are painted like they are on Laugh-In and there's a catfight tournament seemingly being held - and by the first evening's rest, his dreams are filled with images of ritual sacrifice. That's when he joins up with occult expert Professor Marsh (Boris Karloff!) to battle the forces of Satan himself.Making this all the better, Morley, the owner of the Craxted Lodge*, is played by Christopher Lee.Also - Michael Gough appears as a sinister butler!When this was released by American-International Pictures in the U. S., all of the nudity in the virgin sacrifice scenes were, well, sacrificed.Honestly, no one is going to blame you if you just watch the scenes with Steele leading wild orgies of death and psychedelic mayhem. They even distort her voice and toss all kinds of different colors all over these scenes, which make them more than worthy of the time it takes to watch this movie.*It's actually Grim's Dyke, an allegedly haunted house that also was the setting for Zeta One, several episodes of the Avengers and Cry of the Banshee. It was also the home of W. S. Gilbert of Gilbert and Sullivan.",1
5,"This movie was one of the very last accomplishments of the legendary Boris Karloff (not quite sure if those Mexican junk movies were shot before this one but they definitely remained shelved until after his death) and reportedly he got really ill shortly after  or even during  the shooting of ""Curse of the Crimson Altar"". If this is a true fact, it definitely gives the film some sort of sour aftertaste. With a career like his, Boris Karloff should have enjoyed a well-deserved retirement instead of catching pneumonia on draughty film sets at the age of 82. On the other hand, of course, ""Curse of the Crimson Altar"" wouldn't have been half as good if it weren't for him. It already isn't much of a highlight in the genre, but Karloff's presence (along with three others horror veterans) provides an extra dimension of horror greatness.This is one of the Tigon Production Company's more mediocre efforts  completely incomparable to ""The Witchfinder General"" and ""Blood on Satan's Claw""  but still a remotely entertaining Brit-horror flick containing all the traditional ingredients, such as witchery, torture devices, old mansions with secret passageways, ritual sacrifices and psychedelic hallucination sequences. The plot revolves on an antique dealer (and ladies' man!) who heads out to the countryside in search for his mysteriously vanished brother. He arrives in a remote little town during the annual memorial of the legendary witch Lavinia Morley's burning. Mr. Manning is exaggeratedly welcomed at first, but he gradually senses something strange and sinister has happened to his brother in the mansion he's staying. When he then begins to suffer from vivid nightmares involving Lavinia herself, he realizes his name is historically linked to the witch and that he's been put under a sardonic curse.Apart from the cast, ""Curse of the Crimson Altar"" benefices the most from its occasionally very moody atmosphere, the eerie scenery and the impressively staged witchery sequences. Even though these scenes might appear a little silly overall (what with the bodybuilders wearing leather S&M outfits), but they're still definitely a joy to watch when you're a fan of old-fashioned Gothic horror. Barbara Steele is underused and extremely typecast as the malignant Lavinia, but what the heck, even with her face painted green and ridiculously over-sized goat horns on her head, she still remains a luscious beauty. Boris Karloff and Christopher Lee (in their second teaming after ""Corridors of Blood"") are wonderful together, but the still heavily underrated Michael Gough shines as the weird and mentally unstable Elder. Unfortunately, however, the shoddy script contains too many holes and improbabilities, and director Vernon Sewell lacks the talent and horror knowledge to cover these up.One last and perhaps interesting little trivia detail; although entirely devoid of humor otherwise, ""Curse of the Crimson Altar"" features one intentionally wit and unsubtle inside joke. Whilst talking about the old and secluded mansion, the main character mentions something in the lines of ""I expect Boris Karloff to walk in at any moment"" and  in fact  he does only a couple of minutes later. He rolls in, to be exact, since he plays a wheelchair bound character.",-1
4,"With a pairing of Christopher Lee and Boris Karloff, you shouldn't go wrong. But there is very little time of the two in the same scene. Robert Manning(Mark Eden)is an antique dealer that is worried about his missing brother. So Manning makes a trip to a rural English village to start his search. Manning tries to prove that his missing brother has something to do with an ancient mansion belonging to a man named Morely(Lee). Robert gets involved with Morley's niece Eve(Virginia Wetherell), who wants to believe that something bad has happened to the American's brother. The two get entangled in the legend of Levinia(Barbara Steele), a witch that was killed 300 years ago. Was Manning's brother a sacrifice to a cult? Robert and Eve seek information from the village's grand elder, Professor Marsh(Karloff), who is an occult expert. The movie stays busy, a memorable one it isn't.

4,"Curse of the Crimson Altar is directed by Vernon Sewell and co- written by Mervyn Haisman and Henry Lincoln. It stars Christopher Lee, Boris Karloff, Mark Eden, Barbara Steele and Michael Gough. Music is scored by Peter Knight and cinematography by John Coquillon. Plot sees Eden as Robert Manning, who travels to the village of Greymarsh in search of his missing brother. What he finds, however, is a village of secrets...""..and drugs of this group can produce the most complex hallucinations and under their influence it is possible by hypnosis to induce the subject to perform actions he would not normally commit"" (extract from medical journal)Hmm, so begins Curse of the Crimson Altar (AKA: The Crimson Cult), maybe in an attempt to capture the drug taking hippie culture of the late 1970s? What transpires is a rather dull devil-worship movie that wastes the actors on show whilst also trying to expand an hours worth of film into an hour and half. I really think that to enjoy this picture you need to yourself enter a drug induced altered state.More often than not many a horror fan can forgive illogical narratives and cheaply constructed sets and costumes, but normally there is a good vibe to the production, or some visual pleasures elsewhere. Helps, too, if the picture has a strong mystery element to it. Sadly, away from the genre legend actors on show, Sewell's movie has nothing to make one forgive it its flaws.The dream sequences induce smiles instead of chills as the underused Steele turns up in green paint, there's lots of filler scenes that never amount to much and the finale is very weak. Throw in a schizophrenic music score that lurches from harp to low bass and then to organ, without marrying up to the scenes, and it's barely worth the time spent watching the damn thing.Karloff at 82 is the best thing in it, in a wheelchair he puts his awesome voice to good use and gets to be part of the film's best passages of dialogue. Lee is on professional auto-pilot and Gough works real hard to make a routine butler character shifty and interesting. All in all quite frankly it's bitter disappointment and tough to recommend to anyone other than drug addled hippies. 4/10",-1
6,"This is a minor horror film with a superior cast but uninspired scripting and directing. It's certainly enjoyable enough, but this viewer wouldn't consider it classic. The actors are better than the material (which is apparently inspired by H.P. Lovecraft's ""Dreams in the Witch House""). Mark Eden stars as Robert Manning, an antiques dealer whose brother has gone missing. So he tracks him down to the last place he was supposed to have visited: the Craxted Lodge. Robert discovers a predictably strange community where the people pay tribute to a figure from their history: the witch Lavinia (a green skinned Barbara Steele). Robert does some sleuthing while meeting locals played by the likes of Sir Christopher Lee (as Morley, the lodge operator) and Boris Karloff (as witchcraft expert Professor Marsh).The ingredients are there for a decent horror feature: sets, special effects, atmosphere, entertaining characters. There's also some brief nudity (supplied by beautiful blonde Virginia Wetherell, who plays Morley's niece Eve) and little flashes of gore. In the tradition of old black & white shockers, there's a secret passage as part of the fun. Hypnotism is also one of the elements. Eden is likable, but the lovely Ms. Steele is mostly wasted; she's not required to do much. Michael Gough has his moments as the perpetually harried lodge employee Elder. Rupert Davies has a fine cameo as a helpful vicar. As always, Sir Christopher is elegant and dapper and has a commanding presence. It is a treat to see him sharing scenes with Boris (this was the last film Karloff made that played theatres during his lifetime), who enriches the film with his appearances.Not helping matters is the fact that the story is overly predictable, and that the ending is rather underwhelming. While admirers of the actors and lovers of the genre may find this well worth watching for completion's sake, it's not really essential viewing.Six out of 10.",1
5,"Serious but boring witchcraft tale set in 1968 England.Robert Manning (Mark Eden) goes searching for his missing brother in a remote village and gets involved with J.D. Morley (Christopher Lee), his cute niece (Virginia Wetherell), Professor Marin (Boris Karloff), a weird butler (Michael Gough) and a 300 year old witch (Barbara Steele--looking great in green makeup).Looks good with an OK script but not enough material for a full-length movie.  It moves very slowly and gets very dull--it's too bad because the movie is well-acted and dead serious.  Lee and Karloff are obviously having a fun time playing good guys and Steele, as I said, looks great.  However, Gough is wasted terribly.I really can't recommend the film but it's really hard to knock any film that has Lee, Karloff, Gough and Steele in it.  Horror fans will enjoy it (a little).

6,"Curse of the Crimson Altar starts as antiques dealer Robert Manning (Mark Eden) receives a letter from his brother Peter (Denys Peek) who says that he's feeling ill & currently staying at Craxton Lodge located in the small English village of Graymarsh, however when Robert phones the Lodge no-one claims to have heard of Peter so he decides to drive down there & see what's what. Once there he meets the lodge's owner J.D. Morley (Christopher Lee) & his niece Eve (Virginia Wetherell) who again claim not to know his brother but offer him a room for the night, that very night Robert has a nightmare about a witch named Lavinia Morley (Barbara Steele) which doesn't concern him at first but the nightmares continue & they become more & more horrifying & realistic. Robert senses something is up & does some investigation & doesn't like what he finds...This British production was directed by Vernon Sewell & I thought it was alright but wasn't that special. The script by Meryn Haisman, Gerry Levy & Henry Lincoln was based on a H.P. Lovecraft story Dreams in the Witch House which by a complete & utter coincidence so was the second episode of Masters of Horror (2005) which I saw only a couple of days ago & while they both have certain similarities they are actually very different adaptation's & overall I'd say I prefer Curse of the Crimson Altar. The film moves along at a reasonable pace, the character's are OK although a little underdeveloped, the exploitation & horror levels are very low & while the IMDb's 'Alternate Versions' section claims there was additional S & M & nudity that was cut by it's American distributor (I'm positive this is the version which is most readily available these days) I doubt these scenes would make a massive difference. The story is played out like a mystery but it didn't quite grip or hook me the way a good mystery should, the ending is absolutely terrible which just seems to leave things totally up in the air & if your going to start a huge fire in your own house wouldn't you at least get out before the place went up?Director Sewell does OK, it has that unique British feel about it & it has some decent scenes especially whenever the witch Lavinia is on screen, she actually looks very good painted green with an ornate horned & feathered headdress & steals every scene she's in. I'm not sure about the big beefy guy with a silly leather hood with antlers stuck on either side & a gay looking small leather apron which just looks daft. There's not many scares here but Curse of the Crimson Altar is all about the build up. Forget about any blood or gore as there isn't any, there's some skin on show but it's pretty mild stuff.Technically the film is fine with good production values, decent special effects & it's well made throughout. It was apparently shot in Harrow Weald, Middlesex in England in a house formerly owned by William Gilbert of the Gilbert & Sullivan musical partnership. The acting is solid & it's great to see so many horror stalwarts although the 'names' in the cast including Christopher Lee, a wheelchair bound Boris Karloff, Barbara Steele & Michael Gough are all somewhat underused.Curse of the Crimson Altar is a decent British horror film that probably tried to be modern at it's time of release so it hasn't dated that well & isn't as good as many of the Gothic period horror films that were produced in Britain during the 50's, 60's & 70's, worth a watch but nothing spectacular.",1
4,"Man tries to find his brother who may have gotten himself mixed up with witches and witchcraft. Opening scenes of what appears to be an sadomasochistic orgy is what you'll remember about this ultimately dull uncredited HP Lovecraft adaption. Barbra Steel in green makeup and wild head dress and a leather clad dominatrix are the the shots often used as stills from the film for good reason, they are what you remember. I put the film in last night and started to watch it and realized ten minutes in that I had seen it before and had been bored silly by it every time I tried to get through it. I scanned through it to make sure I was remembering it right and realized I was repeating myself. A disappointment. Sure it has Steele, Christopher Lee and Boris Karloff, but its wholly unremarkable with some explanations that are less then satisfying.",-1
5,"This routine horror film has something of a maligned reputation (Christopher Lee himself refers to it as being ""dreadful"" in the accompanying interview), but the remarkable credits involved - stars Boris Karloff, Lee, Barbara Steele, Michael Gough and Rupert Davies, director Sewell and cameraman John Coquillon - and the familiar plot elements involving witchcraft make the concoction quite irresistible.The stars are generally well cast: Karloff is given a great entrance and his character is amusingly acerbic, particularly with regards to bland leading man Mark Eden; Lee basically repeats his role - though here is given greater screen-time - from the superior black-and-white classic THE CITY OF THE DEAD (1960); Steele (in another of her long line of witches!) only appears in various characters' hallucinations - but this, and the fact that she's painted green all over and saddled with a silly horned head-dress, in no way undermines her peculiar beauty and commanding presence; Gough, however, is wasted as a vaguely sinister yet dim-witted manservant; Davies, too, is underused in an all-too-typical vicar role (though his belated involvement does bring about Lee's come-uppance); Virginia Wetherell isn't bad as Lee's niece, who's unaware of his secret lifestyle (despite herself having a predilection for throwing wild parties in their mansion, giving rise to some hilariously dated grooviness!), endangers her own life by falling for Eden practically at first sight (thus incurring Lee's wrath) and even appears briefly in the nude (this was her film debut!). There's nothing remotely memorable about the film (except, maybe, some of its imagery in the scenes where Steele shows up or, rather, is manifested) and can only be seen as a major disappointment given the enormous talent on hand - though the main culprit has to be its lazy scripting, since all the stars have treaded this path too many times before! Lee's interview about Karloff is one of his most interesting and affectionate: I was surprised to learn that he considered SON OF FRANKENSTEIN (1939) the best of Karloff's three stabs at the role of The Creature (though I adore the film myself), but he also erroneously mentioned that Karloff and Bela Lugosi had made a film called ""Pit And The Pendulum"" (which the interviewer - who I assume to be Marcus Hearn - didn't correct...but, then, nor could he help Lee when the latter asked whether the Karloff vehicle in which the actor played twins was called THE BLACK ROOM [1935]!; in this regard, I have to say that I'm irked no end every time an interviewer shows up without having done any preparation about his subject!!). It's also disappointing, to us genre fans, that the great horror stars never discussed their work amongst themselves (at least, according to Lee), as it would have been awesome to know just what they felt about it - and themselves for doing such films! The DVD quality is on a par with the two recent DD Video releases I watched - ISLAND OF TERROR (1966) and NIGHT OF THE BIG HEAT (1967) - and, like the former, has been trimmed slightly for this edition! Having watched all of them now, I'm almost sorry that I didn't pick up DD Video's THE BLOOD-BEAST TERROR (1967) and THE DEVIL'S MEN (1975) as well...and even more that I didn't order their SE of THE CREEPING FLESH (1972) earlier, since I've never watched it and is now practically impossible to find in this guise - having unceremoniously gone out-of-print!!",-1
5,"This movie is disappointing for numerous reasons. It's a disappointing entry within its genre, that besides is a waste of its impressive cast.This is a late British horror movie, of the more old fashioned sort. The sort of horror that started off during the '50's and got made big by mostly the Hammer studios. The sort of horror that is not always too well written and not with the most impressive sets or budget behind it but horror with an always great atmosphere and distinctive style to it, which often made them a true pleasure to watch.You could tell that the era was nearing its end and was more or less over already. This movie is more consistent with other British horror movies from the late '60's, which often focused on the far more psychological horror aspects, rather than old school gore and scares. It's something you could more refer to as Gothic horror. Boris Karloff actually played in quite a lot of movies like this, near the end of his career.And this movie actually was one of last ones. He died one year after the release of it and it was also quite sad to see how he had to play his role entirely in a wheelchair because of his declining health. Still he is one of the highlights of the movie. Not too many people know it but Karloff was actually one fine, great actor, who was capable of way more than just playing the Frankenstein monster.Of course it was also great to see him act along sides other great horror icons, such as Christopher Lee, Barbara Steele and Michael Gough. But it's not like their roles are that great really. The story is also not very consistent with any of its characters. Sometimes they disappear out of the story completely for a too long time.And here is one of the biggest problems of the movie; its story. It's a quite messy one really, that besides is lacking in some real good tension or mystery. The movie remains barely interesting enough to keep watching, which is still mostly thanks to its compelling actors, who still of course have some great screen presence. And the real horror lover will of course still get a kick out of it, seeing the likes of Boris Karloff and Christopher Lee interacting and doing a scene together. This alone should be reason enough for them to go and watch this movie.However let me just warn you by saying that the movie itself isn't much good really.5/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",-1
3,"1968's ""The Crimson Cult"" was a rare collaboration between Tony Tenser of Tigon British and Louis M. Heyward of AIP (previously responsible for Michael Reeves' ""Conqueror Worm""), managing to corral an ailing Christopher Lee (a bad back keeping him inactive for much of the year), native born star of Italian Gothics Barbara Steele, perennial second fiddle Michael Gough, and a dying Boris Karloff, only on screen for a measly 10 minutes but still an improvement on his final Mexican quartet. The poorly written script adeptly bypasses all attempts to convey a cogent story about executed witch Lavinia Morley (Barbara Steele, inexplicably painted green), and her centuries long vengeance against the descendants of those who burned her at the stake, none of which is ever shown or barely even mentioned; the bulk of the running time finds Mark Eden as Robert Manning endlessly repeating the same questions about his brother's disappearance, without it ever dawning on him that the Mannings are among Lavinia's targets, the goal to have their souls signed off in blood. Lee's J. D. Morley remains in pleasant denial for the entire picture until fate decrees that a climax must be played out, Gough's Elder a mentally feeble butler with little to say worth hearing. The one performer listed as 'Guest Star' turns out to be Rupert Davies as town vicar, before his most iconic turn as the Monsignor opposing Lee in the upcoming ""Dracula Has Risen from the Grave,"" also seen together in ""The Brides of Fu Manchu"" and ""The Oblong Box."" Boris Karloff is the main attraction despite only arriving after 22 interminable minutes at a swingers party that makes one long for the insipid antics of Peter Cushing's ""Corruption."" As Prof. John Marsh, foremost expert on the occult, he frequently enjoys snifters of the finest brandy with Morley, but is curiously filmed from wide angles with very few close ups, often apologizing for his mute manservant and once gallantly rising out of his chair to exhibit his collection of torture devices. Even Lee was amazed at the stamina and professionalism of an 80 year old actor able to breathe life into wheezy old dialogue, he too felt the picture quite inadequate for such a roster of wasted talents.",-1
5,"""Robert Manning"" (Mark Eden) is an antiques dealer who has become concerned about his brother not showing up at his office for over 10 days. So he decides to go to the last place his brother visited which happens to be at a large manor in a village called Greymarsh. The notable feature of this town is that every year the villagers put on a ceremony reenacting the burning of a witch named ""Lavinia Morley"" (played by ""Barbara Steele"") which happened over 200 years previously. Since the owner of the manor, ""J. D. Morley"" (Christopher Lee) happens to have a room that is readily available he offers it to Robert so that he can continue his search. However, later that night Robert has a strange nightmare which involves his being held against his will by a woman who greatly resembles Lavinia Morley. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that the combination of 60's psychedelia with a Hammer-style occult backdrop was most enjoyable. Likewise, the inclusion of Boris Karloff (as ""Professor Marsh"") along with the aforementioned Christopher Lee and Barbara Steele was equally appreciated. On top of that, having an attractive actress like Virginia Wetherell (""Eve"") certainly didn't hurt either. Unfortunately, that's where the positives end and the negatives begin as the story devolved into mediocrity which culminated into a rather disappointing ending. To add insult to injury, Barbara Steele's role was woefully inadequate and essentially wasted. In short, what could have been a fantastic horror film turned out to be essentially adequate. No more and no less.",-1
7,"This film has been rather unfairly rated on this site. It's hardly a horror classic, but The Curse of the Crimson Alter boasts a strong horror cast, a nice storyline and an atmosphere borrowed from one of Hammer Horror's many successes. When you look at all elements, to be honest, it should have been a lot better; but you cant expect too much from a sixties low budget horror movie, and this film delivers one and a half hours of fun. Usually with this sort of film, if it bills two or more big actors; you can expect to see them for all of about five minutes. However, this movie stands out because the film's two big heavyweights; Boris Karloff and Christopher Lee appear for quite a while, and while they don't exactly 'star' in the film; their big billing is justified by the amount of time that they appear in the film for. Joining these two is cult beauty Barbara Steele, who basically reprises her role from the Mario Bava masterpiece 'Black Sunday'. She stars as a witch that was burned at the stake, but not before putting a curse on the descendants of the people who killed her. We pick up the story when one of those descendants travels to the town to find his brother.While Curse of the Crimson Alter doesn't offer us anything new where the story is concerned (""if I had a pound for every witch curse movie ever made...""), it still manages to add some verve and imagination to the familiar plot. Not a great deal, mind; but enough to keep it an interesting ride throughout. The atmosphere is well done, and while it's obvious that the film only had a small budget to work with; it makes the best of it, and the house at the centre of the film makes for a nice location to film a horror movie. The two biggest billed stars; Karloff and Lee, haven't been given characters that require them to really flex their acting muscles, but even on autopilot; these two great thespians are able to show what it is about them that makes them so important to the horror genre on the whole. It's obvious that the people who put this movie together wanted to ensure that it had everything about it that made Hammer's films a success; and although it doesn't quite capture the high camp style, it does well enough to ensure that it's still a fun movie. On the whole, it's not great; but fans of this sort of stuff will no doubt find something to like.",1
3,"Considering that ""Black Water Gold"" is about lost gold from the era of the Spanish galleons, you'd think it would be a lot more exciting than it turned out to be. Poor dialog and a poor print ultimately made this film tedious...and perhaps if you can find a copy NOT on YouTube, your viewing experience might be a bit better.The story begins with a guy sneaking into an off limits area to do some poaching for fish. However, while he's scuba diving, he sees some men murdered and dumped into the water! Among the dead guys' possessions are a couple small bags....and inside them are some artifacts from a Spanish galleon. He knows that there's something really exciting here and soon he finds some folks to go on a diving adventure with him in the Bahamas. Unfortunately, some rich jerk (Bradford Dillman) is also after the same shipwreck and he'll stop at nothing to get it.I have been diving throughout the Florida Keys as well as the Bahamas. It's positively gorgeous. But so much of this is lost on this badly degraded print. It's a shame, as this is the star of the film....and without that you are stuck with generally forgettable and unlikable characters, poorly written dialog and a plot that is far more tedious than you'd expect.",-1
3,"BLACK WATER GOLD is a cheap undersea exploration movie which reminded me a little of the Burt Reynolds vehicle SHARK!. It's grainy and unspectacular, making use of realistic locations but managing to waste a number of intriguing cast members in a plot which is anything but special. The protagonists have to loot a sunken galleon before their better-prepared rivals have a chance to do so, but there are no likeable characters here, just men trying to make it rich. Still, the remarkable cast includes no less than Bradford Dillman, Ricardo Montalban, Keir Dullea and Lana Wood among its numbers, which counts for something.",-1
10,"Enjoyed viewing this film which had a cast of some great film stars who went on to great careers in the film industry. Keir Dullea,(Christofer Perdeger),""Brain Waves"",'83, discovered very valuable golden treasure by accident while a murder is being committed almost on top of him. Christofer seeks the assistance of Richardo Montalban,(Alejandro Zayas),""Conquest of the Planet of the Apes"",'72, who was for many years searching for this very treasure that Perdeger just found and knows where this sunken treasure can be located. Lana Wood, ""Santan's Mistress"",'82 gave plenty of beautiful charm to her role. There is plenty of action underwater with plenty of hungry sharks and a great film for the 1970's. In present day life, Lana Wood is struggling with an illness and my thoughts are with her family and I wish her the very best.",1
5,"Out doing a little illegal sample gathering, scuba diver Ray Sandage (Aron Kincaid) witnesses two men murdered in the water just above. Returning to shore, he's delighted and shocked to find a gold coin among the items he collected. Sandage recruits some help to discover the resting place of a Spanish galleon. Sandage's group is in a race to find the treasure with a team that has already proved it will commit murder.While the lure of Black Water Gold might be the promise of a treasure hunt. the thing that I found the most entertaining was Bradford Dillman. Dillman was a fairly competent, but ultimately bland, actor who showed-up in just about every TV program or made- for-TV movie produced in the 70s. He's just always there, but not often the standout. His character, Lyle Fawcett, adds a lot to Black Water Gold. He's a spoiled, rich Mama's boy who is accustomed to getting what he wants. And if he wants the treasure, he'll kill to get it. I loved the scene where he speaks with his mother on the phone. It says volumes about the character. Really good stuff. Beyond Dillman, Black Water Gold benefits from snappy direction, nice underwater intrigue, and a surprisingly strong cast, including the great Ricardo Montalban, France Nuyen, and the stunningly beautiful Lana Wood. It's not the kind of movie that will knock your socks off, but it is an decent way to spend just over an hour.",-1
4,"Fast-paced treasure hunt finds self-proclaimed scuba ""bum"" (Kincaid) framed for murder after local king-pin's (Dillman) thug overdoes the standover routine on two divers searching for antiquities of a sunken Spanish galleon. When Kincaid discovers the ill-fated pair recovered part of the long-lost bounty, he enlists the aid of marine archaeologist (Dullea) and local treasure-hunter (Montalban) to raise the wreck before Dillman can cash-in.Very modest time-filler at best, and sorry to disappoint, but little to no shark (or any other) action mention. Dillman is offbeat as he minces about in flamboyance, whilst the beautiful France Nuyen hangs from his arm foretelling destinies with a perpetual cocktail and Black Magic motifs. Montalban is perhaps the most watchable, both he and Dullea have some sort of back-story on which to develop their characters, unlike poor Aron Kincaid despite being essentially the central protagonist, has little to do but look annoyed and complain. Nevermind, there's a glimmer of hope suggested before the credits roll.Good cast, some sunny-looking Caribbean exteriors and plenty of underwater faunalogue, but ultimately, there's very few shocks or thrills in this 72-minute TV quickie to recommend.",-1
7,"I too saw this film when I was young,15,in 1974, and enjoyed it, But I was in hospital, (with cancer)and very scared, And seeing this film cheered me up and that it why I think have never forgotten it, I too always remembered the theme song, and when I found a DVD of the film, I was fearful that I would spoil the fond memories that I had, I am happy to say that this is still a fun little treasure movie, with lot's of underwater action, good performance's from all the cast , France Nuyen has always been a favorite of mine ,I also like Ricardo Montalban, and seeing this film again, I would say that this is my favorite performance by Bradford Dillman, only trouble with his character is, Why did someone so ""Camp"" Have a Girlfried ?

You should make sure that you know that it is almost entirely re-enacted material. The movie was made ten years after they met up, so keep that in mind, and don't take anything at face value.

10,"In fact, one of my favourites actually. The animation is bright and colourful with no jerky movements or blocky character designs. Also with the merging of the radio commentary and Donald and the bee's movements there are some really clever moments visually too. Coming from a lifelong classical music enthusiast, I found the music to be a real delight, the choices were well-chosen and sounded lively and beautiful. Donald is as temperamental and funny as ever, and the bee is an excellent foil with priceless facial expressions. The gags are hilarious, especially the one with the fake radio and dynamite. Donald getting locked in the shower is a scene where it is amusing but also where you do feel sorry for Donald at the same time. The story moves quickly and is told in a fresh way. Clarence Nash's voice work as Donald is spot-on as always.All in all, truly excellent short that succeeds in being colourful and hilarious fun. 10/10 Bethany Cox",1

The stubborn bee keeps switching Donald's baseball game to music, which of course makes Donald see red. The bee even goes so far as to enter the inside of the radio to make some adjustments that bring the music back on. He's such a cleverly animated bee that he almost steals the show from Donald.Donald's every attempt to re-enter the garden has the bee getting his stinger ready, forcing the duck to retreat. Finally, he plays a dirty trick with a fake radio that has the bee doing a slow burn. Still, while he's showering, the bee finds the real radio again and conducts the music with so much vigor that he's almost exhausted by the time a symphony is over and Donald has another fit.Amusing stuff with some very clever animation as the radio commentator's description of the game matches Donald's and the bee's movements in the garden.",1

10,"A Walt Disney DONALD DUCK Cartoon.Donald & Buzz-Buzz have an energetic disagreement over what should be playing on the patio radio - the World Series or classical music.SLIDE DONALD SLIDE was one of a small number of cartoons which showcased the struggle between the Duck & the Bee and is fairly typical of the lot - fast moving and quite funny. The maestro Buzz-Buzz is imitating is most likely Leopold Stokowski, who was a major collaborator with Walt Disney in the creation FANTASIA (1940). Clarence Nash provided Donald with his unique voice.Walt Disney (1901-1966) was always intrigued by pictures & drawings. As a lad in Marceline, Missouri, he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper; later, as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War, he drew comic figures on the sides of his vehicle. Back in Kansas City, along with artist Ub Iwerks, Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters. Always the innovator, his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe. Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923, where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor. When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor, the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination, ensuring Disney's immortality. The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut, STEAMBOAT WILLIE (1928), a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music. The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared, and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color, illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development, an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable. Mickey's feisty, naughty behavior had captured millions of fans, but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions: temperamental Donald Duck, intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto. All this was in preparation for Walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films. Against a blizzard of doomsayers, Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White, Pinocchio, Dumbo, Bambi & Peter Pan. Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse, or that childlike simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off.",1
10,"This is truly a Very Cool, Very Bizarre movie.I don't want to give away the plot or anything but in the first scene Scott Shaw arrives flying in on one of those mini, open air airplanes, to save Jill Kelly who is being attacked by frogs. That can give you an idea of the whole scope of this movie. In the background the soundtrack is this great surf guitar music. And, that music continues to play throughout the movie.The thing I really like about this film is the bizarre storyline and characters. It is really Very Artsy. You are not going to see this style of character development and edits in your average boring major release film.The other thing I really like about this movie is that it is shot in some very-very-very cool locations. These locations are like the places you see on postcards but never knew that they actually existed.This is a Very Weird, Very Cool Film. I think this movie is really Cutting Edge.",1
3,"For me, the Above line of dialogue, used in my TITLE, was one of the very few bright spots in this extremely short (Thank God for that!) Argentine Film! After viewing, I will bet most people just might be shouting out those very same words of bizarre dialogue!To be fair to all those involved in the production of this Movie, considering it is said to have been made in 1965, the quality of many of its technical production aspects could be considered as, Well..... ACCEPTABLE.... For a South American Film... I suppose!Oddly enough, a couple films made decades later, seemingly borrowed a few of its elements here and there! Pure speculation, of course...On my part... But, then again... Who knows! Maybe I should add...""Who Cares!?!?!?!?""If You should EVER find yourself in a position where this over half a Century old film is an available option... And You are in a quandry as to whether or not to watch.... My sage advice can be synthesized into one syllable:
""DON´T!"" (Unless you are looking for some off-the-wall laughs... After smoking something containing a considerable quantity of 9-Delta-Tetra-Hydra-Cannibal as one of its principal components!!!)3+++ (For a Number of UNINTENTIONAL Laughs!)",-1
3,"Although I certainly enjoy seeking out obscure pre-1970 scifi and horror films, ""Estrana Invasion"" was a particularly tough slog to sit through. In fact, the only special effect of the film is a TV screen that broadcasts a wavy lined image which hypnotizes children and older people. Even worse were repetitive scenes of listless quasi-zombiefied children breaking into their neighbors homes to watch their TVs. Meanwhile, the dull dialogue, amateur acting, mundane sets and cinematography, meander into an absolutely bewildering conclusion that involves souped up swamp gas, germanium. and a crazed electrician who vows to control and destroy everyone at will!However, I did find some amusement viewing an Argentine film with a predominately Spanish speaking cast, that purports to be set in the US. For instance, in my subtitled DVD-R, American actor Richard Conte is constantly addressed as ""Intendent"" and ""Washington officials"" are constantly berated by the irritated town folks. Although, this film released to the US in 1974, it had been sitting in the can since 1965. Watch and see why its release had been delayed for so long.",-1

6,"Just before the start of the 1982 snooker world championship, Alex Higgins gave an interview to a newspaper. He criticised Steve Davis as staid and downplayed his own chances for the tournament. Davis as defending champion was knocked out in the first round and Higgins went on to win the tournament.Ten years earlier Higgins was the youngest world snooker champion, a bolt of lightning in a sport known to be slow and played by old men. My older brother used to rave about Higgins in the 1970s.Then again if you watch this film the only person that raved about Higgins were people who never met him or got to know him. Higgins was a drinker, drug taker, womaniser and a bona fide hell raiser. I think this film just showed us the edited highlights and a toned down version at that. There was a disgusting true incident where he threatened to send the paramilitary terrorists to sort out Dennis Taylor that was wisely excised from this film.Nerd Alert Warning: I saw Steve Davis when he made his snooker television début in Pot Black in 1978 where he played Fred Davis. I saw him do the first televised 147 break which was on ITV and hence not commentated by Ted Lowe as shown here. I even remember his chat show 'A frame with Davis.' Actually I am a fan of Steve Davis even though he is a Tory supporter.This drama made Davis out to be a lot more nerdy than he was at the time but I think it was just to add contrast to the characters. Barry Hearn as portrayed here was a lot more jovial than the hard headed businessman he is and you have to be ruthless if you enter the world of boxing promotion which Hearn did in the mid 1980s. I did think the actor playing Higgins was just too much of the caricature of the Higgins we know from the press and television although I was amazed by the potting skills of the actors or it might had been clever use of CGI.Of course there was a lot more shades of greys in real life back in the days when snooker took off in the 1980s. We just see Higgins and Jimmy White as the bad boys of snooker and the press were more interested in the rivalry between White and Davis who were the emerging new generation.Yet during the era many snooker players lived life to the hilt with booze, drugs and women. Even Cliff Thorburn shown here as dull and with a dodgy Canadian accent was exposed as a cocaine user.Still a celebration of a time when snooker was more than a load of old balls.",1
8,"I grew up watching snooker just as it boomed on TV and the Higgins / Davis rivalry came to prominence, so I thoroughly enjoyed this warts and all dramatisation of the relationship between the mercurial Irishman and the stolid Essex boy in the early 80's. I like my sporting and musical heroes to be mavericks so no prizes for guessing where my sympathies lay and from the production here, I suspect that was true for the director too. Unquestionably an often far from pleasant man, an alcoholic with a foul tongue and short temper, Higgins, like that other genius Belfast boy, George Best, always seemed to have one finger poised over the self-destruct button, treating his life like one big game of snakes and ladders, where the falls outnumbered the rises not only in number but in scale.Sporting rivalry always makes for good copy, as witness down the years Borg and McEnroe, Hunt and Lauda, Ali and Frazier to name but three, where one is usually undramatic and coolly professional, the other as being flamboyant and rebellious. Higgins at his best could beat anyone on the green baize, but with his showmanship, temper outbursts and alcoholic intake all distracting him at times, he could never match the discipline, professionalism and steadiness of a Davis. If Higgins was the self-proclaimed People's Champion, then Davis was the Grannie's Favourite.This BBC movie accurately captures the 70's and 80's era as snooker came out of the smoky back rooms and, its image greatly cleaned up, onto TV screens as the favourite armchair sport of the nation in the mid 80's. With a largely contemporary rock music soundtrack in the background, although many songs are haphazardly placed in the wrong year, excellent recreations of the big matches themselves and above all a terrific performance by Luke Treadaway as the compelling Higgins, I was certainly transported back to my youth eagerly following the Hurricane's wayward progress in both his sport and his troubled life.With sharp dialogue, including many good jokes and fine acting support by Will Merrick as the ""interesting"" Davis and especially Kevin Bishop as the latter's Kingmaker manager Barry Hearn, this was as riveting as watching Higgins compiling a break. I didn't believe everything I saw, especially the scenes where Higgins begs Hearns to be his manager or Davis talking Higgins out of his depression at losing a match when well into his decline, but I recognised enough other scenes and can allow some dramatic licence to heighten the drama.In the final summing up I'd prefer to watch Higgins play than Davis, but after the match I'm sure I'd prefer to be in the latter's company. I'm sure they played down some of the Irishman's excesses, but being deceased, he probably deserved the respect this fine film affords him. And just as a postscript, I personally think they should have added his name to Best's for the naming of Belfast's airport, his star burned as brightly and briefly as his footballing near-contemporary.",1
7,"THE RACK PACK tells a straightforward tale by contrasting the life of clean-cut Steve Davis (Will Merrick) with that of maverick Alex Higgins (Luke Treadaway). Obsessed with snooker from an early age, Davis was taken up by manager Barry Hearn (Kevin Bishop) and transformed into a media personality. His trademark gestures on the snooker table was carefully studied; and he was encouraged to make jokes about his allegedly boring public persona. Success on the table only helped to increase his profile; throughout the Eighties he was always the man to beat.Higgins was the complete antithesis. A genius at the table, he led a wild private life dominated by drink. He had a family, with a long-suffering wife (Nichola Burley) and two children, but they eventually left him. He had plenty of money and spent the lot; in desperation he approached Hearn to manage him, but was abruptly refused. His star declined; by 1990 he had been eliminated in the first round of the World Snooker Championship.Brian Welsh's production tried to adopt an even-handed approach, but it was palpably clear that Higgins's story was dramatically more effective, thereby proving Barry Hearn's point that people respond to failure more enthusiastically than success. Luke Treadaway's performance was thoroughly creditable, combining relentless self- confidence with chronic insecurity. He needed the company of others, especially his practicing (and drinking) partner Jimmy White (James Bailey); when White signed up for Hearn, Higgins was left completely isolated.The only real criticism that can be leveled at this production was that it did not really take account the positive aspects of Higgins's life. He was certainly self-destructive, yet he also put snooker on the map as a televised sport. In the days of Ray Reardon and John Spencer the game was perceived as respectable yet rather staid, the kind of thing suitable for the BBC's POT BLACK yet not a ratings winner. Higgins's colorful personality helped to transform the game into a huge success during the Eighties, attracting viewing figures far in excess of mainstream sports such as soccer.Nonetheless, Welsh's production made a thoroughly competent job of recreating snooker's glory days, with its recreation of the Crucible Theatre and John Sessions's memorable impersonation of ""Whispering"" Ted Lowe's commentary interspersed with the BBC's original soundtrack.",1
9,"The Rack Pack is right up my street. I was big into snooker in the 80's and 90's . The time when the sport was massive and it had some larger than life personalities. None larger than the focus of this film Alex ""Hurricane Higgins"" Higgins. I never liked Higgins very much back then because being from Plumstead I was a big Davis fan . This BBC film doesn't sugar coat Higgins at all. it's quite brutal in it's portrayal and because of that I have to compliment the director Brian Welsh . Probably the most impressive thing about this is the casting. Luke Treadaway is great as Higgins ( the accent strays a little at times) as is Will Merrick as Steve Davis but the inspirational piece of casting is Kevin Bishop as Barry Hearn. Bishop got Hearn down to a T. I absolutely loved this film and if the BBC keep producing dramas like this they can have no complaints from me about the licence fee.",1
9,"Having just watched Ronnie O'Sullivan beat Barry Hawkins 10-1 to win his 6th Masters title, I tuned in to The Rack Pack on BBC iPlayer for a great throwback to the 70s & 80s of Snooker. I myself have been a massive snooker fan for the past 10 years, I know a lot about players from the past from reading various books about them and of course seeing a lot of them still involved in snooker today, playing and commentating/analysing.Unfortunately I wasn't around when these players were at their peak so this film provided me with some great insight. The main actors playing Steve Davis & Alex Higgins were terrific. It was also great to see plenty of other players portrayed in the film such as Jimmy White, Dennis Taylor, Cliff Thorburn, Willie Thorne & even a mention of Stephen Hendry towards the end of the film.The whole atmosphere of the film was excellent and seemed very realistic. The Crucible looked as good as ever, the commentary was authentic and the crowds looked real. Although many snooker fans will know the outcome of the film and each match that is shown, that doesn't make it any less dramatic. It's just great to see how these characters dealt with the fame that snooker bought them. The film had a lot of heart and the story was told with a lot of realism as well as a lot of good humour. The film also boasts a brilliant soundtrack which sets the scene perfectly.Overall I am very impressed with this film on iPlayer and I hope to see more of this kind, whether it's about snooker stars or a different sport altogether. Highly recommended to snooker fans especially but I also think people who like good drama programs can enjoy it too.",1
8,"In the 1970's the BBC show Pot Black started to create some TV personalities like Ray Rearden and Dennis Taylor. Who would have thought that a program about two men taking turns to hit balls with sticks would be popular but it took off. Pretty soon the world championship snooker tournament was being televised. Millions of viewers proved they had the desire and stamina to watch games that lasted hours, interest in the players grew and the prize money rocketed.The Rack Pack documents snooker's rise in popularity and how it alternatively made and broke two people. It focuses on Alex Higgins and Steve Davis. We see one personality being created from almost a blank canvas. On the other hand we see a dynamic personality destroyed by inner demons, be repaired and then self destruct.In parts this film is funny, sad, informative and made me reflect on the need for identifiable personalities in sport. Do we need ""bad"" boys in our viewing before we really engage? At 88 minutes this film isn't as long as some snooker frames and is well worth your time.",1
10,"Tells the story of the hurricane Alex Higgins & his rivalry with Steve Davis , his battle with drink & drugs , his highs to his downfall but considering its to do with Snooker its a great great film and you'll love it .",1
7,"Great idea for a story and was immediately interested but from when I first watched the trailer, I thought, why oh why do they hire English actors to play Ulstermen? Plenty of good Irish actors out there and Luke Treadaway just isn't up to it. Perhaps those with little Irish contact will not notice but it disappointed me from the start.Apart from that it was quite entertaining and a glimpse into the start of snooker as we know it. I met Barry Hearn around 84 as a young kid. I wish I would've met Alex Higgins. Hope Alex is right and the miracle happens and Jimmy does finally become world champion!. I hope his daughter gets paid for this too. The film is about Alex and he's dead, she should get royalties",1
10,"Thinking back now,this probably my 4th or 5th review.
I had sadly lost my copy of this what can only be described as a classic in my opinion,and only recently managed to source another.
Watched again same night and there is (which I was not aware of just how much) so much animosity between the two main characters,which I will just add here Luke Treadway and Will Merrick,both fantastic in their roles here,firstly portraying Alex 'Hurricane' Higgins,he is just as I remember him from the late 70's - early 80's,arrogant,obnoxious but he was at that point the 'peoples champion',so much to his annoyance a new golden boy (aka Steve 'Boring' Davis) emerges and is quickly taken aboard by manager Barry Hearn (played excellently by Kevin Bishop),from the outset his mannerism is true to life,totally nerdy..especially one of his first scenes entering a snooker club (not giving away too much).
It portrays the love/hate (mainly on Alex's side,well hate really) and actually quite saddening brief scene where Davis goes back in to arena after seeing Higgins lose (and we see him once more on road to destruction still drinking alcohol long after lights have gone down) and he offers him some real good friend advice,but obviously with Higgins looking through a muddled haze of alcohol/whatever other drugs he could lay his hands on,he refuses and hurls insults at forlorn Davis.
Another mention I must say played her part brilliantly was Alex's wife (played by Nichola Burley) ..Hell that woman put up with some s**t before finally realizing Alex was NEVER going to change his ways of drink/drugs and womanizing (didn't know he was such good friends with late Oliver Reed until I watched this movie),and she finally saw sense and left Alex.
Alex's best friend in most of this film,Jimmy White (awesome acting James Bailey) sees his rise in game but never quite managing to hit world champion (such a shame I feel),he is supposedly another bad boy of the game,but yet never really see him up to no good here or in real life even (that I recall),but Alex was deeply annoyed/saddened when Jimmy revealed to Alex he had gone and signed with Mr. Hearn and newly formed 'Matchroom Mob'..after this point we see unfortunate Higgins spiral rapidly down,a quite emotional scene where he actually went to see Barry Hearn,begging for him to be signed up,but and rightly so Barry had more sense and refused..only further angering Higgins so he does what he does best and goes for more alcohol.
I'm going to leave it at this point,because there are other points in film which I'm not giving away (simply because I want others to enjoy this film as much as I did).
Yes,I'm an avid snooker player/fan and pool BUT,and I see this as important..this movie should/will appeal to most viewers not just those fans of the green baize !Honestly wouldn't have thought it was a made for TV movie,but certainly doesn't feel like it either.
Be nice to hear what others think after watching this.
Look forward to reading more reviews in the future.
And at just under 90 minutes in total you not much to lose..I see there are a couple of 'so-so reviews',can't understand why/where from",1

8,"Just watched the Rack Pack on iPlayer and thought it was great, very amusing and moving in turns. The performances were very good, but I can't help feeling they made Steve Davis seem a little bit too nerdy in the early days, asking the manager of the first snooker club about the pockets and the slate for instance. Whilst I'm not denying Alex Higgins' talent, I did think the programme focused more on him, and made him the real main character. Personally, I was never that fond of him as a 'character' and have always admired Steve Davis for the way he handled himself, even moreso now as a respected presenter and commentator of snooker. Also, I'm sure all the real life people gave their approval to the portrayals on film, but I don't think Jimmy White has done himself any favours by agreeing to how he was portrayed in this drama. Finally, these 'real life' docu-dramas always leave me wondering how accurate they are, was Higgins really so rude to Cliff Thorburn and his wife, so that Thorburn laid into him physically. But overall, very enjoyable and watchable, and very well acted.",1
10,"After watching the final on Sunday 17.1.16 and then the scenes for this film I was well eager to download it on the iplayer. What a treat. I'm 62 and in those days I lived in a snooker hall. Pot Black in black & white and colour eventually. This film really did bring back the nostalgia. I found the actors portraying the snooker players to be very realistic and all did excellent jobs. Brilliant directing and story line. Self destructing Higgins and clean cut Davis where brill in my opinion. Steve was great as he comes out of his shell, gains his conference and gets cheeky with the help and guidance of of Barry Hearn. Same goes for self destructing Alex 'no malice he was a great guy' I will deff watch this again I enjoyed it that much. A must see for snooker fan and all. I hope they do one about Rocket Ronnie, I'd love that. Well done all those involved with the making of this top notch film. I",1
8,"The Rack Pack is more of a reminisce on the good old days of snooker in the 80s, than an informative look at it. While it's a great piece of entertainment, it does nothing to solve the problems snooker faces now, i.e, why there are so many clubs shutting down despite the top dogs claiming it's a global sport. To get snooker to the heights or, at least back to the glory days of 85 would be near impossible if there were more clubs and talent scouts around to nurture the next generation of talent. Sadly, for me, this film was just a piece of dotage on the past, a time that will never be recaptured unless something is done now to inject a bit of vigor into the game at grassroots level. A great watch, but a forgettable piece of drama that won't leave you craving to watch it again and again...For a detailed review, go to the NEWSHUB/Snooker: what do you learn from the Rack Pack...",1
10,"From Treadaway's accent and mannerisms, to the clever interposition of excerpts of TV commentary from those early 1980s matches.. this film is (like the Steve Davis era it portrays) universally professional.The characters are spot on, the emotional story played with respect, but without deference and above all (in capturing the effectiveness of this piece) the snooker sequences are brilliant! If you go onto Youtube and watch Higgins' 1982 Semi-Final ""break of the tournament"", then straight after you watch Treadaway jerking and swaying to the same beat you will see what I mean. How on this planet they recreated that blue to the top corner??? - The best thing I've seen for at least a year!",1
7,"I thought the movie was very good, the first half brought some very good music tracks back to life. I seem to remember that in 1979 the snooker was on the BBC for hour after hour, and if memory recalls Higgins lost to Taylor during that championship. However 1979 was a dark year for most of the people in the U.K. when something happened that made the £ or $ sign more important than people. It took Higgins another ten years until 1982 to win the title again, which is where the film portrays him to be struggling as the best, but not the most commercialized snooker player. The films shows one of the main characters out to be a child of this greed for cash. Nearly forty years later I still have the same opinion as do nearly all my mates of that said person. Anyway good sounds, good story, (not sure if all snooker player portrayed sold their souls for cash) In short it appears that the title would of been more appropriate to be named as, (Barry Hearne is a CTNU)",1
10,"This is the best movie ever made.This is movie is the epitome of creative writing and acting. The director is Da Vinci reincarnate, the inventive nature of this genius will astonish generations to come, he has set the bar for for all future movies.It's not really fair to this movie to even compare it to anything else, but i will do a feeble attempt anyway. This would be the equivalent of taking the story from The Godfather, visuals of Avatar (at period height), the humor from Ghostbusters, with twist that puts the 6th sense to shame, and with cinematography that can rival the combined artistry of Star Wars and Jurassic park. Mix it all in a star filled cauldron heated by the dreams of a thousand children, then poured the mix into a diamond lined mold, which would proceed to implode upon contact resulting in a massive explosion of awesome that makes Hiroshima look like a firecracker. Then you repeat this process 23 times, and the result would be Antfarm Dickhole.Do not watch this movie, you will never be able to enjoy another movie again.",1
7,"For a B, or even a D movie that this is, there are some wonderful aspects to such a low budget, poorly acted movie as this. First, the plot is original and hilarious. Second, it has just what D movies are made for: lots of people dying, and lots of naked women. Third, it has one of the most obvious and offensive titles ever. Fourth, everyone's name and many of the words have ""ant"" substituted in it, such as ""ant- nihilation"" instead of ""annihilation"" and ""ant-ticlimatic"" instead of ""anticlimactic"". Fifth, the dialogue surrounding evolution and relationships is very well written and deep; juxtaposed against the poor acting and strange script makes it stick out and brilliant.These actors own the terribleness of the story line, the people dying own being eaten alive by ants, all the while centralizing around a man masturbating a lot and shooting ants from his penis to get revenge. Oh, and the girls in the bikinis are the smartest people in the film? Classic.",1
10,"A movie that is based souly off of a guy masturbating and half naked ""actors"" taking their sweet ass time to lay down on a towel or in a convenient pose for the weird pedophile/weird masturbating guy to shoot his dollar store toy ants out of his dollar store dick and somehow kill them but overall it is one of the ""classics"" and is a great movie/porno to scar your kids physically and mentally from and overall just make your kids turn out to be a weird emo pedophile but damn did it make me laugh my ass off at how poorly scripted and filmed this movie or porno i don't know which it is so i rate this 10/10 because it deserves an Oscar for being one of the most visually scaring retarded movies out there.",1

1,"Crappy storyline. Dull acting. Meaningless dialogues.
You can predict that the film will be awful after watching the trailer.
Punjabi Cinema is experimenting with new stories, but this one is just same story with a different name. Clearly budget was huge but they invested in the wrong script. Ninja is just worst among the three, Bawa is still acceptable in certain ways.
May be five years back this would have been successful.",-1
1,"In conclusion, only watch this movie if you have time to waste.
No storyline, no real actor in the lead. The lead roles are played by few Punjabi singers. No surprise, nowadays all Punjabi singers want to become actors and this film made this dream come true of 3 singers at once.",-1

6,"WARNING: Watching this film might cause your head to explode! I'm just sayin'.....""The Littlest Rebel"" begins in an insanely over-idealized view of the South during the time of slavery. Little Virgie (Shirley Temple) is having a birthday party and all the slaves on the plantation are thrilled to be allowed to serve her! All the slaves are very well-fed and dressed and so happy! It's THAT ridiculous a view of slavery!! Yes, these slaves actually root for the Confederate Army and would probably volunteer to be slaves--it's THAT ridiculous. When their land is overrun by Yankee soldiers, the slaves stick around and keep working for their beloved owners! And, to further solidify this insane view of blacks, Willie Best (I guess Steppin Fetchit wasn't available) is on hand to act sub-human and harmless. And, there's that darling little scene at the 20 minute mark where Shirley is in black-face to avoid the Yankees finding her (and she looks a lot like the Aunt Jemima character)!! The film clearly promotes a ridiculously bigoted and idealized view of slavery, I advise parents to watch this with their kids and folks with heart conditions to have their nitro tablets and a defibrillator nearby just in case!! The rest of the film has to do with the war. While Daddy is away, Momma and Virgie hang on--waiting for each trip he makes back through enemy lines on his scouting expeditions. However, eventually, Momma becomes seriously ill and Daddy once again sneaks through the lines--only to see her moments before her death. Now, poor Virgie needs some place to live and Daddy decides to sneak her off to Richmond. But, to get there, he needs to sneak her with him--and that won't be easy. It gets a bit ridiculous here, as a sympathetic Northern Colonel actually helps him in this task because he also thinks Virgie is wonderful (EVERYBODY thinks she's wonderful, actually). But, when they are caught, it's up to Virgie to save the day. How? Well, see this for a sweet but 100% ridiculous ending.This film is quite offensive but, like all of Shirley's films, highly entertaining. Her wonderful dancing with Bill 'Bojangles' Robinson and ultra-sweet persona carry the film---making you enjoy it despite the utter silliness of the plot. Well worth seeing even if it is a SERIOUSLY flawed film.By the way, I really agree with JohnnyOldSoul's review when he says that the best way to combat racism is NOT to sweep it under the rug (i.e., ban this film) but to talk about it. Yes, the film is VERY offensive, but it also gives us an interesting history lesson about how bad things were racially in the 1930s--when the ""Birth of a Nation"" view of slavery was pretty much assumed to be true. Plus, seeing it shows us just have far we've come.",1
5,It's a good thing that both Shirley Temple is so adorable and that John Boles was on a mission of mercy trying to get his sick wife and Shirley's mother through the lines for proper care. Otherwise there ain't no other reasons to look at this ode to the Ante Bellum South that we see in The Littlest Rebel. I also could add Bill Robinson's dancing.Even today I find it unfathomable that people bought into this wonderful stereotype. The film opens with Shirley's birthday party with her peers being served by the happy slaves willing to do all for dear old master. Even the slave children who can't attend the party as equals get up a collection and make little Shirley a doll.The news of the firing on Fort Sumter interrupts the festivities and it's war. During the course of the war because of his knowledge of the terrain Boles becomes a noted Confederate spy. But then Karen Morley gets sick and he has to undertake a personal mission. Unfortunately it's with Jack Holt's Yankee uniform so he and Holt are in a jackpot.Without the entertaining of Shirley and Bojangles this second cousin film of Birth Of A Nation would rate a lot lower than it does.,-1
6,Virgie Cary (Shirley Temple) is a precocious child on a plantation estate. Uncle Billy is her dutiful slave servant and James Henry is the slack-jawed slow-witted one. The war breaks out during her 6th birthday party. Her daddy joins the rebel army. The plantation falls behind Yankee lines. Captain Cary sneaks home to visit as a scout. Marauding Yankees are searching for him and Virgie puts on black face to hide. The kind Colonel Morrison stops the troops' pillaging.This is a different era in Hollywood. It's the vision of antebellum south where slavery is gentle and harmless. Slaves are dutiful and submissive. One can't judge it in modern terms but one can't ignore the historical slant either. It's also a movie that is trying to appeal to a family audience. It does have the innocence of a child who doesn't see the point of the war. Its heart is in the right place for its time but times have moved on.,1
4,"Southern civil war officer John Boles goes on the run behind enemy lines, leaving his household at the mercy of invading northern troops. Sweet Shirley Temple does all she can to aid mother Karen Morley and slaves Willie Best and Bill Robinson, befriending the pickaninny children and cheering them up when they're blue. Black shoe polish turns her instantly into a black child, fooling all but one northern soldier and none of the audience. She works her way into the heart of Northern officer Jack Holt and when the agonies of the war leads to tragedy, Temple must continue to help out daddy while remaining continuously cheerful.While this remains entertaining simply as a Shirley Temple vehicle, as history, it is hogwash. Temple further goes down cloying territory with a re- written version of ""Polly Wolly Doodle"", later parodied for its sickening sweetness by Julie Andrews in ""S.O.B."". The other major flaw is that Temple is totally miscast as a supposed Southern child, a part that should have gone to the Atlanta born Jane Withers. I can understand the black adults being loyal to protecting Shirley but Boles and Morley are far too nicely presented as slave owners, a stereotyped presented in Hollywood seemingly for decades. All is forgiven though when Shirley and Bojangles do their sidewalk dance in exchange for train fare to see President Lincoln, an embarrassingly absurd finale.",-1
9,"This was the first Shirley Temple movie I ever watched (on VSH....hey, I'm not THAT old) and I still consider it one of her best.That's because it has a great mixture of drama, comedy, song/dance and suspense. Almost all the characters are likable. The two dances scenes with Temple and Bill Robinson are excellent....a joy to watch. I don't know if Shirley ever looked cuter than in this film. She runs the gamut of emotions in here quite frequently.The 74-minute story never has a lull. John Boles and Karen Moreley are people you root for, Willie Best provides good comedy and there is a surprising amount of suspense.Overall, however, this is simply a sweet, sentimental film that leaves you feeling good after watching it.....and what's wrong with that?",1
3,"At her Richmond birthday party, six-year-old Shirley Temple (as Virginia ""Virgie"" Cary) is delighted when dutiful dancing slave Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson (as ""Uncle Billy"") entertains on cue. The towering tap-dancer doesn't understand slavery. And yet, Mr. Robinson is one of the smarter servants in the cast. The others, led by Willie Best (as James Henry), can most politely be described as mentally challenged. The outbreak of the US Civil War disrupts Ms. Temple's happy life. Handsome father John Boles (as Herbert Cary) is called to duty, and ""The Littlest Rebel"" must see President Lincoln himself, to set things right...Unless some subversive statement is being made by having the confederate ""Curly Top"" leading a group of Black children in white-coned caps, the motive is strictly to entertain. However, the story features abhorrently rampant racism. Here, the slaves are happy to serve the obviously superior white folks - and why shouldn't they? They wouldn't know how to say, ""Emancipation Proclamation,"" let alone understand slavery. Other racially problematic films have some depth to the characters, attempt to honestly reflect the times, or advance film as an art. You have little of that, here. Temple and Robinson dance appealingly together, however.*** The Littlest Rebel (12/19/35) David Butler ~ Shirley Temple, Bill Robinson, John Boles, Willie Best",-1
6,"Shirley Temple's natural way with lines and look of pure enjoyment as she shares a tap dance routine with Bill Robinson, is reason enough for Shirley's fans to want to watch THE LITTLEST REBEL. When these two go into their dance steps, it's a pure pleasure to watch.Not so pleasurable is treatment of the North and South and the Civil War, least of all the dim-witted jokes at the expense of the blacks. How far we've come since 1935 is painfully evident throughout much of the story and is bound to be something audiences have to overcome if they care to enjoy the story.Once again, Shirley's father is handsome John Boles and there are plenty of competent adult performers surrounding her--but make no mistake about it, the film belongs to the little star whose wondrous way with song and dance (and lines) makes her the most precocious and precious of all the child stars. Her ""Polly-Wolly-Doodle"" and ""These Endearing Young Charms"" are proof positive of her rare talent.",1
4,"That's the big question here. In 2011 (or so), can a viewer get past the racism still present in films in 1935 to enjoy an otherwise rather pleasant movie starring 20th Century Fox's financial savior -- Shirley Temple. From the very start of the film, the racism in the way the Negroes (the term primarily used in 1935 American life) were portrayed is deplorable. It reminds me of Bing Crosby's ""Abraham"" number, which he does in black-face, in ""Holiday Inn""...an otherwise delightful film...what were they thinking????? To be honest, in this film, the racism is so pervasive that I can't get past it. Willie Best's character, in particular, is portrayed in the worst possible light.On the other hand, though still a slave in the film, the dance performances of Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson here shows what a remarkably talented individual he was. However, his most memorable dance performance with temple -- the tap dancing on the stairs (a routine he only taught to two people, one being Temple) -- is in another Temple film (""The Little Colonel""). Nevertheless, it is Robinson's performances here that are the real treasures of this film.The plot (and the happy ending), though somewhat predictable, is quite good, as are performances by John Boles and Jack Holt as military men on opposite sides. But, once again falling into the racism of the 1930s, Shirley Temple does have to end up in black-face. Shame, shame, shame. The scene with Abraham Lincoln and Shirley Temple is quite memorable.If it weren't for the over-the-top racism in this film, I'd give it a ""7"", because for a 1935 film, the production standards were quite high. But, due to the racism here, I'll demote it to a ""4"".",-1
5,"Shirley's comfy confederate life is disrupted by Yankees invading her home and breaking up her family. It is perhaps unfair to criticize the performance of a seven-year-old, but her mugging can become tiresome for those who are not fans of the diminutive star. The acting of the adults is pretty bad, not helped by the corny script, awful dialog, and characters that don't resemble real people. McGlynn makes a laughably goofy Lincoln. The depiction of blacks is embarrassing, particularly Best as a mentally challenged slave, a character meant to be funny. The best thing about this mercifully short film is the dancing of Temple and ""Bojangles"" Robinson.",-1
10,"During the War for Southern Independence, THE LITTLEST REBEL, all of 6 years old, defies the Yankee soldiers with spunk & courage.20th Century Fox gave this film a rather lavish production, knowing they would recoup all their costs because they had a box-office bonanza in Shirley Temple. The Diminutive Dynamo does not disappoint. Oozing charm from every pore, she establishes her complete dominance of the movie early on and never relinquishes it. Either defiant or disarming, she is equally delightful.John Boles & Karen Morley play Shirley's parents and do quite well, especially considering that they're really only there to help showcase the Mighty Tyke's talents. Jack Holt gives a sympathetic performance as a good' Yankee, while Guinn Williams is properly villainous as a rotten one.Willie Best steals a scene or two as a timid slave, and Frank McGlynn Sr. scores in his few minutes as Abraham Lincoln (yes, the Great Emancipator is not immune to Shirley's tears).The legendary Bill Robinson has a sizable role as a faithful slave of Shirley's family. He plays the part with grace & dignity, flashing a smile that is every bit as engaging as hers. His dancing is beyond praise - as always - and in little Miss Temple he has a partner who can match him step for step.It should be noted that there is quite a bit of racism in the film, showing that Hollywood of the 1930's had much in common with the America of the 1860's.Shirley sings Believe Me If All Those Endearing Young Charms' & Polly Wolly Doodle.'",1
8,"THE LITTLEST REBEL (20th Century-Fox, 1935), directed by David Butler, another agreeable and rewarding motion picture featuring child star, Shirley Temple, teams her once again opposite 1935 co-stars John Boles (CURLY TOP) and Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson (THE LITTLE COLONEL). Capitalizing on the success of THE LITTLE COLONEL, set after the Civil War, THE LITTLEST REBEL, taking place during the war between the states, finds Temple as a little girl winning the hearts of those around her, especially a tough Yankee soldier (Jack Holt) and U.S. President Abraham Lincoln (Frank McGlynn Sr.), with whom she shares his apple. An old chestnut by Edward Peple that was first staged and  later filmed during the silent era in 1914, this edition, Temple's last for 1935, further demonstrates her as a fine child actress who equally handles her lighter and dramatic scenes with conviction and sincerity.The story is set on a Southern plantation where Herbert Cary (John Boles) and his wife, Helen (Karen Morley) honor their child, Virginia, better known as Virgie (Shirley Temple), with a birthday party where she and her little guests are gathered together with ice cream and cake along with tap dancing entertainment by Cary's slave/ butler, Uncle Willie (Bill Robinson). Shortly afterwards, the party is disrupted by startling news that war has been declared between the states. Enlisting in the Army, Cary leaves his wife and child under the care of Uncle Willie. With Yankee scouts invading their property, Virgie, while playing soldier, sling shots Colonel Morrison (Jack Holt), addressing herself as a ""confederate."" In spite of their differences, Morrison, a father himself, takes an immediate liking to Virgie, later rescuing her from the threat of the villainous Sergeant Dudley (Guinn Williams) for not revealing the whereabouts of her ""daddy."" After the Cary estate is burned to the ground, causing Mrs. Carey to fall ill and die within three weeks time, Cary leaves his post to take Virgie over to Richmond where she's to be placed in the care of her Aunt Caroline. Complications arise when Carey is recognized and captured, separated from his daughter, imprisoned along with Morrison for helping him, each charged with treason and sentences to be executed.    With 20th-Fox specializing in Southern stories set during, before or after the Civil War, THE LITTLEST REBEL is a fine example capturing Southern hospitality and flavor with the reconstruction of plantations and notable songs from that era including ""Swanee River"" (by Stephen Foster) sung during opening credits; ""Turkey in the Straw"" (tap dance by Bill Robinson); ""Those Endearing Young Charms"" (sung by Shirley Temple); ""Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child"" (by Thomas Moore and Matthew Locke); ""Polly-Wolly Doodle"" and ""Polly-Wolly-Doodle"" (sung by Temple and reprized during closing titles).Of its cast members, Bill Robinson and Willie Best provide lighter moments to their traditional servant roles. Best's performance as a shiftless and comical slave gives the impression that his role as James Henry was actually intended for Stepin Fetchit. While Best doesn't imitate Fetchit's comical methods to the extreme, he works well alongside Robinson as his comic foil doing a brief takeoff in the popular ""Amos and Andy"" radio show tradition in the question and answer session where Best asks Robinson: ""Why is a shoe called a shoe?""  Although portraying their roles through stereotypes, Robinson comes through as an intelligent, caring and sensible slave with a talent for dancing. He's very convincing and sincere through his interacting with Temple, which is why they work so well together. John Boles satisfies as the easy-going father turned soldier and accused spy while Karen Morley, despite of her screen limitations, makes due with her role.Due to controversy in how the black performers are portrayed, cable television revivals of THE LITTLEST REBEL in recent years have been limited, though shown frequently at some point on American Movie Classics (1996-1999), the Fox Movie Channel, and availability since the 1980s on home video and afterwards DVD either in black and white or colorized formats. In May 2006, THE LITTLEST REBEL was one of the films chosen as part of its subject matter of ""Black Images on Film"" theme co-hosted by author Donald Bogle, where he and host Bob Osborne discussed the film, performances of Robinson and Best, as well as a scene where Temple gets herself corked up to avoid Yankee soldiers. THE LITTLEST REBEL, along with THE LITTLE COLONEL, were intended as screen entertainment with no intention to offend, yet something to consider as a reflection of the times, and how a Civil War story such as this is seen through the eyes of Virgie Carey, the littlest rebel.

9,This movie is so wonderful. Utterly enchanting. My young grand daughter love this movie every time we put it on and laugh at the many funny antics of adorable little Shirley. Comedy and fun for the whole family. James Welch Henderson Arkansas 6/16/21.,1
7,"The previous review of this movie begins with the question ""Can you get past the racism of the era?"", and concludes that you can't. I won't argue that you should ""get past"" the racism. Rather, I'd argue that you need to look right at it and see that it is not simple, and not just a matter of stereotypes.Yes, Willie Best's character is an embarrassment when it is not infuriating. There's no arguing that.But Bill Robinson's character is very different. He is the one on whom Mrs. Cary relies when her husband is at war, he is the one who makes it possible for Cary to get back to see his wife as she is dying, etc. He is also the one who makes it possible for he and little Virgie to get to Washington and, eventually, plead her father's case with President Lincoln. In short, he is the character who makes pretty much everything good happen. Yes, there is injustice in that he should have received higher billing as a result, and he should have been in the final shot with Temple, as he was as important as her father and more important than Jack Holt. That was unfair, and though probably based on what Fox thought American audiences of the time would tolerate, nonetheless a concession to the racism of the time. But for its time, this movie is remarkably devoid of the ""dumb and happy darkie"" stereotypes of the time that are so infuriating.Furthermore, little Virgie never once treats ""Uncle Bill"" as anything less than an equal. Nor do her parents ever treat him disparagingly.Race relations in this movie are not perfect. But neither are they stereotypes. There is no point on zooming in on Willie Best's character and going through all the modern clichés of moral superiority, only to dismiss it. The movie deserves better than that.Yes, the dancing by Robinson and Temple is a wonder. But this movie has other things that are worth examination as well.Forget what you may have been told about this movie and try to watch it with an open mind. You won't waste your time.",1
10,"10/10, of course. Song and dance movies are my favorites, and you know that.Bill Robinson (Mr. Bojangles IRL) was the absolute best master tap dancer who ever lived. He was very famous for his stair dance. In this movie, he and Shirley dance on a few short stairs, but in another one they tap dance up and down quite a long flight (can't remember which Shirley movie). It is too bad racism kept him from being the greatest dance star of the movies, and that his roles were always/usually household staff. Gentlemen named Astaire, Kelly and O'Connor were supposedly the best tap dancers, and Bill shamefully didn't get their leading roles. I love them all, however. The best women tap dancers were Eleanor Powell and Ann Miller among others, plus of course dear little Shirley Temple. I think Bill may have taught her some steps, however.I like Willie Best in this movie. You have to be a very smart actor to play a dumbbell. Just ask the late, great Marilyn Monroe. Willie got lots of lines, not to mention punch lines, so he was never in this movie the under-5 actor who only said a few sentences. James Henry was talked down-to a lot by Virgie/Shirley, and I feel that that was not only racism but the usual disrespect/depiction of 1935 plus Civil War era of Caucasians ordering African Americans about.1938 saw John Boles again play Shirley's Army father in ""The Little Princess"", this time in the Boer War. 1936 saw Jack Holt portray Mr. Burley in ""San Francisco"" (starring Clark Gable, Spencer Tracy, Jeannette MacDonald).I liked Mr. Lincoln, up to a point. Virgie must have been starved. Abe gave her those apple slices. I feel that Virgie and Uncle Billy did not sing and tap dance enough on their way to the White House, because all I could tell was that they needed money for their train fares and it was not shown if or how they ate any food. Too bad Mr. Lincoln did not offer Uncle Billy any apple slices. Lincoln IRL was not necessarily an abolitionist, and he wrote the Emancipation Proclamation as a political move. He was rather racist, despite what you may have been told. I imagine Uncle Billy was just as starved as Virgie. The racists were not all in the South.Virgie's mother and father were superb. Did Mrs. Cary have consumption? John Boles played good fathers. In this movie, I liked him in both the Confederate as well as Union uniform. He cut a quite dashing figure.",1
5,"One could say that the essential thing about all ruling, all exploiting and all humiliation is to make most of those that you rule over, unaware of their slavery, even if, as in this film, they are called slaves. Right after the civil war, there was a general understanding amongst winners of that war to go easy on the conquered South. Even Lincoln is said to have the orchestra playing ""Dixie"" as he stood there on the balcony receiving the praise of the people for the victory. Why, one might ask, was this so? The South's kind of slavery was a very lazy one, in which the slaves knew that they were slaves and in which there were only black slaves. Less lazy rulers want all to be slaves, except themselves, of course. The South's kind of slavery was a provocation and to let it go on could easily have resulted in another, for the men in power much more dangerous war, the war of all slaves (not just those being called slaves) of all colors against the rich and powerful. That was not allowed to happen. This film glorifies ruling and cleverly even manages to glorify the kind of slavery in which people are called slaves and openly are bought and sold. By taking a stand for the South in the times of the civil war, Hollywood did with this film sanction ""fatherly"" leadership, which we are supposed to believe being ""good"", even if we are sold and bought. Using a lovely motherless child and any number of ""Uncle Tom's"" for this purpose, as in the story of this film, does, as it seems, give rise to no blushing whatsoever. The liar lies so much that, in the end, he believes his own lies. A gruesome ""cute"" little film selling slavery to the slaves!",-1
7,"I am not a super-duper humongous fan of Shiley Temple, but boy, was she a good child actress. My favorite S.T. movie is ""Heidi."", but I think this one is a close second.It takes place during the Civil War. Shiley Temple plays Viginia Cary, a young girl who lives in the south with her parents. Her father is called to the Confederate Army, and tries to sneak back to visit his family. He's arrested, and a Yankee arranges an escape. But it doesn't work, and they are both arrested and sentenced to death. But Virginia and Uncle Billy, a friend of Virginia's, goes to visit President Lincoln and begs him to intervene.This is a classic movie about war, and one that actually has a good ending.My score: 7/10.",1
7,"The Littlest Rebel is probably one of Shirley Temple's infamous and most controversial movie that she has starred in. It is extremely sympathetic toward the Confederate side of the Civil War but the eternal charm that Shirley Temple gives in each of her movies can't help being repressed.The story is simple. Shirley T plays a little Southern girl named Virgie Cary a adorable moppet who seems to hold the social graces that would put Emily Post to shame. Because she is so cute and polite, everyone finds her irresistible. Oh! She is also a TERRIFIC tap dancer to boot! One sunny afternoon (April 12th) while she is celebrating her birthday, news flies in the door that Fort Sumter was fired upon and The War between the States has begun! Virgie is the child of Southern parents on a beautiful plantation with the happiest bunch of slaves that you ever seen---so we know what side her father will fight for.Life for Virgie changes somewhat after that. Like any child in the Civil War, she misses her father who has gone off to battle. But Virgie has incredible spunk and bravery when she confronts the ""Yankee"" army and actually seems to want to do battle with them when some of the soldiers get mean with her and try to steal from her home and pushes her mother roughly down the stairs. Luckily, her bravery and stubborn pluck captures the heart of a Union Commander who later tries to help her father. When Virgie's mother is stricken with an illness and dies, her father is captured and the kind Union Commander is also implicated. There is only one person who can save them....Can Virgie charm the socks off of Abraham Lincoln in Washington D.C and get a reprieve for them? African American's will not view this movie favorably because it shows a preposterous view of the treatment of slavery. The slaves seemed so happy that they don't want to leave. The Cary's seem to be kind slave owners---the slave quarters are furnished tastefully like a roadside motel. There are no beatings or mention of abuses. Of course, there are dreadful black stereotypes like John Henry.But the most interesting actor besides Shirley T is Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson whom I consider one of the greats in tap dancing. Temple and Robinson enjoyed a very close friendship outside the studio. It was said when Temple saw Bill Robinson on a movie set, she had a mad compulsion to run up to him, take him by the hand, tug at him and look into his eyes and smile. When Bill Robinsonlooked down and saw her tugging at his hand, he couldn't resist her childish charm and smiled back at her. Temple maintained that ""Uncle Billy"" was the one adult who never treated her like a child but as an equal adult. Robinson said that Temple was one of the most talented young person when it came to dance--all he had to do was show her a routine twice and she picked it up immediately. Robinson also displayed a fatherly protective figure with Temple. A story was said that when Temple married John Agar, Robinson congratulated him but said ""Be good to my little girl or I'll kill you"" If you watch the interaction between these two on film, you could see Shiley Temple's eyes light up like a Christmas tree. I am sure that they felt some type of respect for each other off screen that carried into their outside lives. Relationships between black and white actors were not forbidden at that time but they were not encouraged. But we could say Temple and Robinson have been dubbed the first inter-racial couple on screen.Despite the false picture of slavery, The Littlest Rebel entertains us thanks to the talents of Bill Robinson and Shirley Temple. There is a tap dancing scene halfway in the picture that can't be missed. Sure, the plot is campy and corny, and Shirley's sugar sweet demure is gut wrenching---but for some reason it entertains.",1
8,"Miss Temple, at her most adorable, charms not only the Union army but the President in the age old story of a daughter's love for her father. The sets are well done, the acting ranges from acceptable to very good, the dancing sequence iconic, and the plot is as realistic as any fantasy can be. Sadly, many people try to apply today's societal and behavioral boundaries to an 80 year old film, not realizing that in another half century much of their own behavior and 2019 attitudes will offend these future critics as much or more. Watch the movie as it was intended and you might even enjoy it.",1
6,"There are two very good opportunities afforded by this film. One, it's entertaining, fast-paced, and Shirley really shines.The second is a chance to talk to your children about the way black characters and white characters interact in this film. Some younger children may be confused by the divide between the black characters and the white characters (especially those who attend racially-diverse schools,) but this is a good time to explain to them the racist attitudes of the time period, and ask them how it makes them feel.The best way to combat racism is not to sweep it under the rug, but to teach children where we were, how far we've come, and how far we still need to go. Give children the credit they deserve, they will understand.This film is a perfect opportunity to relate to your children and instill guidance.",1
9,"The portrayal of the Civil War is quite good, but the issue of the treatment of slaves isn't bad here. John Boles and Karen Morley (as Mr. and Mrs. Cary) apparently have about as good a rapport with their slaves as one would expect. Both do an excellent job, but Shirley Temple always steals the show. Willie Best is silly as usual (I've seen him be that in several films, so the ""dumb slave"" stereotype he seems to get is merely comic relief--and I'm not being racist, I think he's wonderful!). Billy ""Bojangles"" Robinson gets the most spotlight besides Shirley, with John Boles close behind. Boles plays a well-known Confederate spy, but is fascinating when he's quick-thinking and authoritative, and so tender with Shirley--a bit similar to those that ""Uncle Billy"" has with her. Jack Holt is also noteworthy as a principled Yankee out to capture Cary (as are many more Yanks), but is tender-hearted when he meets Shirley that when her Dad is discovered in his own Yankee uniform, takes a big risk and gives Cary a pass for Shirley to get to Richmond. Cary says he'll never let her out of her arms again, and Colonel Morrison (Jack Holt) said, ""I don't think my country expects me to make war on babies."" The value placed on human life here is plain in those two lines.",1
10,It really draws you in. This is a fantastic movie. A whole new generation of our family now enjoys the movie.,1
4,"Where to start...?Made in 1935, this bizarre story of the Civil War is told upside down. It's difficult to imagine what the studio was thinking when it made this film. I wonder what the movie-going public thought at the time. I can't imagine people north of the Mason-Dixon line would have appreciated it very much. Perhaps the studio was pandering to a Southern audience who was still smarting from the reality that their way of life was forever altered by the Civil War--and this film recreates (or perpetuates) a fantasy of the South's lovely, gentile way of life, in which everyone knew his place, and it all worked just fine.In any case, in this movie, confederates and white Southerners are depicted as noble, intelligent, kind, good, and very much entitled to owning slaves. They are presented as quick-witted, distinguished, and morally superior to the Northerners. Not one of them has a Southern accent.Northerners/Yankees, on the other hand, are made out to be dumb, vulgar, cruel, and inhumane--inexplicably oppressing the kindly Confederates. As viewers we're astonished when one of the bedeviled Northern Aggressors (some Southerners *still* in 2005 refer to the Civil War as the War of Northern Aggression) cuts Shirley's father a break and helps him out.The slave characters are drawn 2 ways. The first is being so numb-skulled, mush-mouthed, and knuckle-dragging as to appear mentally disabled--and it's clear that this grotesque caricature is supposed to be screamingly funny. It's not. It's stomach-churn-caliber material.The second way slaves are depicted is just brimming with love for their massahs, beside themselves with delight in their obedience to them--and even worse, trying to subvert the bad Yankees, since the slaves don't want to be freed.Shirely Temple's black face disguise, her masquerading as a ""pickinniny"" (a small black slave child) is one of the more repugnant things I've ever seen in a movie.Almost as bad is her character's regard for the slaves as idiot children--scolding them when she sees them stepping out of line (shaking her adorable little finger at them) and alternately treating them like her cute little pets.A very uncomfortable film to watch. And aside from the dreadful racist historical context--oddly enough--Shirley Temple is quite glorious and the musical numbers are lively and fun.",-1
3,"Rod Holcomb mostly has worked as a TV director. For this film, he declined to use his name, instead going by Alan Smithee. Is it really that embarrassing? As bad as making the movie Chains of Gold, the only thing that John Travolta ever wrote?Parker Stevenson, Geoffrey Lewis and Brian Tochi (yes, he of Takashi from Revenge of the Nerds, Leonardo the Ninja Turtle and Nagata from Police Academy 3 and 4 fame) are medical students running afoul of the administration, which would be Eddie Albert.Robin Dearden, who would one day by Bryan Cranston's wife, is in this. So there's that. You learned something, even if these medical students didn't. It does, however, have a great open where the three medical madcaps dress up as cadavers and freak out an entire class.I can accept cops being against the rules. For some reason, I can't do the same with doctors. I don't know what that says about me.",-1
1,"Fun at med school. Hurray! Yeah right! This is a stupid, ridiculous movie, not even good for its genre. Lots of beer, a few body parts, a bad dean, what else...The first scene with the cadavre sets the tone of this abysmal movie. How low can you go? This one go pretty low on the tasteless, unfunny scale.Why bother watching if not just to satisfy a bizarre urge to rate a bad movie.Out of 100, I gave it 49. That's good for 0 stars out of 4.Seen at home, in Welland, on December 14th, 2001.",-1
6,"this is one of the medical school movies the eighties produced. all follow the English romantic comedy 1950s era DOCTOR IN THE HOUSE to an extent but none quite attain the elegance and sophistication of English template.of course directed at an American audience this films do have to have an element of silliness and teenage humour to sell tickets. three students are charting a course through medical school; one is an American --- ugh -- who is quite a comedian; a foreigner who befriends him is a far more serious student but there's a serious matter at hand. who teaches whom and what exactly must be learnt? the film does have an important point which it makes well, against the backdrop of a ridiculous pageant of body parts. it isn't quite so bad as some have said and is worth revisiting.the film lacks the charm of certain of its rivals. It isn't quite as genteel as GROSS ANATOMY or as rich in social comment as BAD MEDICINE but certainly towers over PATCH ADAMS which is a pure abomination.",1
3,"""Stitches"" fails on just about every level that a film can fail on.  It is not clever in the least, it is visually drab, and it has literally no plot for the first 80% of the movie.  Over an hour has passed before anything resembling a story structure begins to appear.  The preceding hour is filled with tired 80's cliches: spying on naked girls, a sidekick whose name references a body function, and even the evil dean.  There truly isn't one original concept in this movie; the main character's name is Bobby Stevens for crying out loud!  (SPOILER)Suddenly, 7/8ths of the way through the film, Bobby is kicked out of school; he apparently pulled one too many not-quite-funny pranks.  Obviously, he must find a way to get back into medical school (how exactly did he get into medical school in the first place?)  Now I am no dimwit, but I have no idea why the events that then take place should result in him getting back into school.  He participates in an abruptly introduced pageant that inturrupts the dean's big presentation.  Also, of no less importance is the fact that a man literally rises from the dead with no explanation given.  The fact that he does this serves to humiliates the dean, but apparently doesn't arouse the interests of medical experts at the school.  Lastly, it must be said that the boom mic operator who worked on ""Stitches"" needs to be removed from his respective union if he hasn't been already.  There were so many egregious examples of the mic poking it's way into the frame that it became the biggest laugh of the film.
I should conclude my comments by saying that while ""Stitches"" is a terrible, terrible film, I actually enjoyed myself quite a bit while watching it.  If you're looking for a deliberately lousy, campy film littered with foolish cliches and clumsy innuendo, I'd heartily recommend checking this one out. But just so that you don't get confused, the dean DOESN'T like pranks, and Bobby Stevens DOES like to party.",-1
2,"JACK HUNTER: THE STAR OF HEAVEN is the last of the three made-for-TV movies starring Ivan Sergei as everybody's least favourite Indiana Jones rip-off. This one's slightly more lively than the previous - terrible - instalment in the trilogy, JACK HUNTER: THE QUEST FOR AKHENATAN'S TOMB, but that doesn't make it anywhere approaching good.Hunter and his chums are back, attempting to solve the mystery of a plundered tomb in their search for an ancient magical artifact. This time around, the Russian mob are also involved in the search, so we get a nonsensical storyline padded out with various inept chase sequences. The stunts seem to always be cheesily handled by director Terry Cunningham, although that's nothing compared to the ineptitude of the special effects team; just wait until you see that CGI lava! THE STAR OF HEAVEN contains a mixture of wooden and embarrassing performances across the board, a general tired seen-it-all-before air of nonchalance, and little reason to watch for all but the most enthusiastic of B-movie veterans.",-1
4,"This is the third in the series of the Indiana Jones mock buster TV series. They now go to Turkey to find the artifact still battling the Russians who want it. This time it is Nadia's (Joanne Kelly) ex-boyfriend who helps out and plot spoiler, like Jack's ex-GF in the last film they both die to make the relationship easier unlike in real life where ex's stay around and haunt your every move. The series lacked a decent soundtrack and one decent B lister. Jake Busey as the bad guy. John Rhys-Davies as the sidekick. Imogen Poots as the ex-gf. Denise Richards as the NSA girl. It is not as if these guys are doing anything and would cost a lot.",-1
6,"Jack's third and final adventure has him learning that his old adversary Albert Littman has designs on the Eye of the Star of Heaven, Jack heads for Turkey, the last known location of the relic. Helped on his quest by local antiques dealer Nadia, Jack soon manages to pick up the trail, only to be confronted by Littman's henchmen, leading to a deadly showdown in the lava fields of the Turkish mountains.The conclusion of the Jack Hunter trilogy has a bit more going on within it due to the tying up of several narrative threads. Jack Hunter confronts his nemesis in a good scene. Hunter realises his love for Nadia through his sidekick Tariq's observations in the best scene of the film. This trilogy of films is tight knit and plays out like one huge film, beginning, middle, and end, further aiding my theory that this was one huge, or lengthy production, broken into three ninety minute films to maximise profit. Not bad. The way trilogies should be shot really. No? Just me?The CGI in this film is just above Asylum and is aided by some good framing and overall appropriation of it. The music is just alright. Better than most direct to video action films I've seen. Typical epic fare, but it does the job.Jack Hunter 3 is the most engaging of the three films because it has the most interesting villain and has the strongest writing of them all. Watching the previous two films does better the experience somewhat, but i imagine skipping them and still finding some entertainment within this.",1
10,Do not believe the bad reviews..... superb show!.....,1
5,"Lee Dixon and Ross Alexander are minor actors in the history of Hollywood and here they both star as two struggling guys trying to peddle their musical show. But when you read their back story on IMDb, they are a very sad couple of guys. Before this film even debuted, Alexander (Barry) was dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound (he was 29)! And, less than a decade later, Dixon (Pinky) would be dead...a guy who drank himself to death at age 42! Talk about tragic! Fortunately, their co-star, Ruby Keeler, had a much happier life!When the film begins, Pinky and Barry are both struggling to market their new show. Fortunately, they just found a backer--and in order to get this backing they need to sign a British actress. When they go to meet her, the duo make a mistake and accidentally hire an unknown chorus girl (Ruby Keeler) with the same name. She's excited about the opportunity and so she keeps quiet and just accepts the offer. Unfortunately, when folks learn the truth, the show closes. What's next? See the film.What follows at the end of the movie are a whole bunch of production numbers. Some are a bit dull, though the typewriter sequence is pretty amazing to watch. Overall, a passable bit of entertainment...but not much more. The songs aren't all that memorable and the plot is slight to say the least. The film could have used a bit more comedy to lighten the mood.",-1
5,"As people have already noted, 'Ready, Willing and Able' is notable for being Ross Alexander's swansong before his tragic suicide and Ruby Keeler's last film for Warner Bros, but they certainly aren't the only notable factors of the film.'Ready, Willing and Able' is not a great film, but it does have enough to make it watchable. Keeler is a very charming screen presence, and Alexander a likable leading man. Most of the supporting cast also fare well, with the hoots that are Allen Jenkins and Louisa Fazenda faring best. Wini Shaw is also very winning, as is Jane Wyman.Of the song score, only one is really outstanding. That is the sublime ""Too Marvellous for Words"", though ""Be Handy on Your Feet"" is also catchy and ""Just a Quiet Evening"" very listenable. Don't remember much of the rest though. The classical music selections of Schumann, Chopin and Liszt are also a delight.The film looks pretty good, apart from the odd tacky moment, it is very skilfully photographed and while not exactly expansive the set is generally a long way from cheap.Conversely, to me Lee Dixon was wooden in acting and even more so in his dancing, which doesn't look natural or rhythmic at all. There is a lack of chemistry between Keeler and Dixon, though occasionally a sweet one with Alexander, just that one does miss Dick Powell (who one can't help thinking that he would have been a better choice). The story, even for a film musical, is overly simplistic, goes overboard with the silliness and dumbness and is as thin as thin ice.Even flimsier is the hugely underwritten and dull script, that's far too lightweight. Of the choreography and dancing, the only one that stands out is the clever type-writing sequence. The others are pedestrian and under-cooked, am aware that one shouldn't expect Busby Bekeley to be involved in every film musical around this time but the songs generally did deserve better treatment than the indifference they were given here, this was a film that cried out for his involvement really.All in all, watchable but not great. 5/10 Bethany Cox",-1
6,"Ready, Willing, and Able is noted for being the last film Ruby Keeler did for Warner Brothers and the last film Ross Alexander did on earth. With Ruby it was that the public was just not interested in seeing her without Dick Powell. She couldn't carry a film on her own. Ruby was a fine hoofer, but couldn't sing and was a worse actress. But she was the big name here.As for Ross Alexander after finishing this film he committed suicide before it was released in 1937. I'm sure that in itself cast a pall over the box office.It's a backstage story just like the ones Keeler did with Powell. Ruby is a young ingenue named Jane Clarke who has the same name as a famous British musical comedy star. Fast talking agent Allen Jenkins signs Ruby thinking he's got the star and sells her services to a couple of other hopefuls, Ross Alexander and Lee Dixon who are putting on the eternal show. That sets in motion the rest of the story.The image of this film is Ruby Keeler and Lee Dixon tap dancing over a typewriter keyboard set to the big song that came from this film, Too Marvelous for Words. It's one of the best movie songs of any era and was recorded by a slew of artists. The big hit records of it were by Bing Crosby and Margaret Whiting, the daughter of its composer, Richard Whiting. Ross Alexander was not the only tragic story coming out of this film. Lee Dixon left Hollywood and scored big on Broadway for Rodgers and Hart in Higher and Higher and then really big for Rodgers and Hammerstein as the original Will Parker in Oklahoma. He also had an interesting role in John Wayne's The Angel and the Badman. Sadly he died of alcoholism only 17 years after Ready, Willing, and Able.A good thing Alexander didn't live to see himself singing in this film with an obviously dubbed voice. Poor man looked plain ridiculous.",1
5,"A great deal of credited and uncredited writing talent went into this screenplay expansion of Richard Macaulay's Saturday Evening Post story about a songwriting duo in New York City who are promised show-money if they can get land a musical-comedy starlet from the London stage for their latest production, ""Fair Lady"" (!). Busy, friendly musical has some good wisecracking lines, but not enough star-power in the cast. Ruby Keeler has a rather inert role as a would-be performer who is hired for the lead by mistake, yet it's a part which doesn't allow her to shine (only to be a shrinking violet). Keeler does do a tap-dance routine on the keys of a huge typewriter, but the choreography is lax (despite netting an Oscar nomination!) and certainly isn't as imaginative as the set design. Real-life songwriting team Johnny Mercer and Richard Whiting contributed several songs, though the best of them (""Too Marvelous For Words"") is sung ad nauseum. ** from ****",-1
5,"Musical play writers Ross Alexander (as Barry Granville) and Lee Dixon (as Pinky Blair) work out a song and dance while their pants are being pressed. Playing modest for the movie studio, both Mr. Alexander and Mr. Dixon prefer boxers to briefs. The enthusiastic duo may have a tuneful Broadway hit on their hands. A backer mandates they hire an English actress to star, and agent Allen Jenkins (as J. Van Courtland) goes to pick her up. But Mr. Jenkins accidentally signs similarly named Ruby Keeler (as Jane Clarke), putting the show in jeopardy - she's no actress, but is she ""Ready, Willing and Able""? This was, most notably, the last film appearance for Ross Alexander, who ended his life with a suicide...In what looks like a marketing decision, Warner Bros. likely switched Alexander's billing with Dixon's (he would have his most memorable success on Broadway with ""Okalahoma!"" before succumbing to alcoholism). Despite the sadness, the show goes on with the happy-go-lucky duo playing well together. Alexander's best moment is emotionally introducing ""Too Marvelous for Words"" to Ms. Keeler; she and Dixon have a memorable dancing sequence, showcasing the #1 hit show-stopper. Also, there are appearances by past favorite Louise Fazenda (as Clara) and future favorite Jane Wyman (as Dot).***** Ready, Willing and Able (3/6/37) Ray Enright ~ Ruby Keeler, Ross Alexander, Lee Dixon, Allen Jenkins",-1
10,"Mistaken for a famous British singing star, an American college girl decides she's READY, WILLING AND ABLE to conquer Broadway - especially after meeting the young scriptwriter who's producing the play...A fine example of the musical comedies which Warner Brothers seemed to produce so effortlessly during the 1930's, it's a shame this film has become so obscure. With good production values & a snappy storyline, it's still a pleasant entertainment. The major missing component is Busby Berkeley; the final production number, with Ruby Keeler & dancer Lee Dixon hoofing it upon the keys of a giant typewriter, fairly cries for the Master to send it over the top.Pert & pretty, Miss Keeler is, as always, much fun to watch. Many of her scenes are given the added attractions of the lovely Carol Hughes, playing her best friend. Wini Shaw, as a singer with too much past & tart-tongued secretary Jane Wyman also contribute to the fun.The comedy relief is largely handled by Allen Jenkins as a loudmouthed agent, Louise Fazenda as a faded Shakespearean actress & Hugh O'Connell as a society fuddy-duddy. Comic cameos by E. E. Clive & Lillian Kemble-Cooper as an English knight & lady, and Barnett Parker as a helpful British butler, are also welcome. Movie mavens will spot an unbilled Carlyle Moore Jr. as a dockside reporter.Ultimately, though, there is sadness attached to this film. The leading man, Ross Alexander, shot himself before the film could be released. This was his final film; he was only 29. Born Ross Smith in Brooklyn in 1907, Alexander had the personality, talent & good looks which should have spelled significant stardom. But Hollywood is notoriously unpredictable, and Alexander, unhappy with the way his career was going & obviously still troubled by the gunshot suicide of his first wife in December of 1935, placed a pistol to his own head on January 2, 1937.Once dead, it was Warner Brothers that paid him the final indignity. Having a completed film with a star who was not only deceased, but a suicide as well, was a bit more than the Studio wanted to deal with. So, cutting their losses, they gave Ross Alexander fifth place billing on the lineup of performers for READY, WILLING AND ABLE, where he should have received first or second.Outside of his appearance in A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM (1935), he is almost forgotten now. Ross Alexander was a victim of the Hollywood system and his own private anguish, each of which fed on the other. He should be remembered as a fine young actor, who, in a very few years, brought lots of enjoyment to movie audiences. This is typified by his best scene in READY, WILLING AND ABLE, where he introduces the Johnny Mercer lyrics for 'Too Marvelous For Words,' by gently reciting them to Ruby Keeler. It is a tremendously poignant few moments.",1
6,"READY, WILLING AND ABLE (Warner Brothers, 1937), directed by Ray Enright, is a lightweight backstage story produced in late 1936 that marked the en of an era for Ruby Keeler as the tap dancing darling of Warner Brothers musicals. With Lee Dixon, Allen Jenkins and Louise Fazenda listed below Keeler's name, the main focus is actually on Ross Alexander, billed fifth in the casting credits. Sadly, upon completion of this musical, Alexander had committed suicide in January 1937, leaving one to wonder how far he could have gone in motion pictures, which began for him in 1932, followed by a Warner Brothers studio contract in 1934. The plot in brief finds Barry Granville (Ross Alexander), a songwriter, actor and producer, who, along with Pinky Blair (Lee Dixon), hoofer and partner, hope to get their show, ""Fair Lady"" (no, NOT ""My Fair Lady"") produced on Broadway. McNeil (Addison Richards), an agent from Amalgamated Pictures, agrees to back the show if they can get a well known personality to appear in it. It is suggested they try to get Jane Clarke, an English musical-comedy star currently making headlines. They so happen to locate a Jane Clarke (Ruby Keeler), an aspiring dancer and student of Broadfield College returning home from England with her classmates. After the ship docks New York, she is approached and mistaken for the English singer by J. Van Courtland (Allen Jenkins), a theatrical agent sponsoring Granville. Jane is coaxed by her friend, Angie (Carol Hughes) to sign an immediate contract with Granville, feeling this would be her big opportunity to crash Broadway. Granville, of course, falls in love with his young ""English"" star, which makes it difficult for the guilt-ridden Jane to get enough courage to tell him the truth about herself. She does continue, however, with her masquerade, British accent and all. The jig is up, however, when the real Jane Clarke (Winifred Shaw) arrives from England after learning that she's to appear in a show she knows nothing about. However, the English Jane Clarke turns out to also be a fraud, which causes further conflict for Barry.As with the latter MGM musicals that starred Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland in the late 30s/early 1940s, the cast in READY, WILLING AND ABLE is so energetic, especially Alexander and Jenkins, that it's ashame they couldn't rise above a mediocre script. Alexander's singing voice is obviously dubbed and Lee Dixon (who looks more like a movie cowboy than a Broadway hoofer) tap dances like a puppet on a string. An average score by Johnny Mercer and Richard Whiting includes: ""The World is My Apple"" (sung by Lee Dixon); ""Handy With Your Feet"" (sung and danced by Keeler); ""Just a Quiet Evening"" (sung by Alexander/ danced by Keeler and Dixon at dinner party), ""Sentimental and Melacholy"" (sung by Winifred Shaw); and the hit tune, ""Too Marvelous for Words,"" which is plugged three times during the story, becoming the closing production number in which Keeler and Dixon tap dance on keys to a giant typewriter, compliments of choreographer Bobby Connolly, whose dance direction is usually mediocre at best. This production number was, however, nominated for an Academy Award for best dance direction. Aside from the song and dance, Louise Fazenda and Teddy Hart do a very familiar comedy routine during dress rehearsal, one that better served comedy team of Bud Abbott and Lou Costello in THE NAUGHTY NINETIES (Universal, 1945). Look for it. Featured in the supporting cast are Hugh O'Connell as Keeler's middle-aged but uninteresting fiancé, Truman Hardy; Shaw and Lee as the piano movers who do tap routines; Barnett Parker as a authentic English waiter; and a very young and cute Jane Wyman as a sharp-tongued secretary.In spite of mistaken identity plot used numerous times in 1930s musicals, the best being GOLD DIGGERS OF 1933, READY, WILLING AND ABLE failed to become a classic. One of the few channels to have aired this musical at one point of time was WPHL, Channel 17, in Philadelphia, prior to 1974. Currently available on Turner Classic Movies, take notice whenever READY, WILLING AND ABLE is preceded by a three minute theatrical trailer that most of the major leads and their scenes are described and highlighted with the exception of Ross Alexander. His dubbed singing is heard, but is never seen. On a personal level, the chemistry between Keeler and Alexander fails to register that certain spark and charisma Keeler made opposite Dick Powell in those seven musicals, and once opposite her overgrown husband Al Jolson. If remembered at all, READY, WILLING AND ABLE would be noted for its introduction to the popular tune of ""Too Marvelous For Words."" (**1/2)",1
8,"Fazenda wonderful. Alas, dear Yorick. This woman was totally fantastic in her intelligence and comedic timing. Her Shakespearian notes were not random and run on. They were wonderful.Just found out about Alexander and Dixon. So sad. Only room for one Dick Powell, and whoever else Dixon was shoved aside for.Saw Alexander in Midsummer Night's Dream. He was simply marvelous.Losing a point for black and white.Losing another point with me for no Busby Berkeley.That said, I just love the typewriter scene. Did not realize typewriters were that advanced at that time. I thought Busby choreographed it, but I didn't see him in the opening credits.The chorines playing and dancing the typewriter keys were spot on wonderful.Ruby tap dancing wonderfully. Higher heels showed she could really tap dance, opposed to naysayers of her 42nd street film where she danced in flat shoes and people said she looked awkward. Flat tap shoes have a stronger sound, and always sound more masculine than higher heeled tap shoes on women.This was the Great Depression. Warners never had the reputation of great technicolor musicals had by MGM. Looks like budget very tight in this film. Dixon and Alexander not totally famous. Both must have worked in this film to pay for their bills or Dixon's alcoholism. At any rate, both actors must have been hard up for money.Dixon went on to star in the stage Oklahoma, so that is a very good credit. I thought his dancing in this film was wonderful, and wished there had been more of it.Same for our darling Ruby. Dancers get paid for more dances, and it still looks like budget constraints limited her terpsichorean appearances.I am a tap dancer, and I love tap dancing.Eight out of ten. No technicolor. No Busby Berkeley.",1
6,"Lee Dixon and Ross Alexander, struggling songwriters, are dancing in their boxers because the tailor has their pants. The tailor wants fifty cents for his work, but they haven't four bits between them and so must resort to musical distractions. ""Every time I come up here,"" the tailor complains, ""you sing me out of your pants."" Meanwhile, shipboard, Ruby Keeler and a bunch of other ""college girls"" put on a show for their fellow ocean liner passengers. They're amateurs—but this is a Warner Bros. musical, so the show is big and polished. Ruby does a great song and dance; she would love to be a real Broadway star, but she knows that could never happen.Music and high spirits abound in this lively musical about getting one's big break. Keeler, of course, gets her shot at the big time, as do Dixon and Alexander. And of course there is a major complication.Allen Jenkins is at his best as a failed stage actor who, having tried everything else, becomes an ""agent"" and thinks he sees his big chance when he overhears a telegram being phoned in, sending to England for a big star.Louise Fazenda is very funny as Ruby's teacher or chaperone, who admits that she herself once had aspirations as an actress—and then spends most of the movie reciting jumbled bits of Shakespeare. She holds her purse like a skull: ""Alas, poor Yorick,"" she intones, ""I knew himintimately."" (At which Allen Jenkins gives her a funny look: ""What's your friend doing now?"")Ross Alexander, as the songwriter, has the privilege of speaking and then singing the film's great song, ""Too Marvelous for Words."" Keeler's most memorable dance is the finale, in which she and Dixon dance from key to key on a giant typewriter.Somewhat oddly, Keeler doesn't really sing and Alexander doesn't dance, and so the leading couple don't do any true duets—Alexander sings to Ruby instead of with her, and Dixon fills in as dancing partner.Overall, it's no classic but still very entertaining—especially for fans of Ruby Keeler's wonderful dancing.",1
7,"This movie is very nice. Not a must see but worth seeing. Ruby Keeler is always fun and pretty to watch. She dances fine in the movie. Carol Hughes is beautiful. Wini Shaw is an excellent singer and very beautiful. But she sounds a lot like Helen Morgan which is something that might of stopped her from gaining more fame. Ross Alexander is attractive and has a nice voice but he's no Dick Powell which stopped him from gaining fame at Warner Bros. Louise Fazenda is funny as usual. Anyone who criticizes Ruby's dancing, should see this movie, she dances quite well in ""Handy with your feet"" number. She acts fine and naturally as a girl in her position would.",1
7,"This film is of a long lost art--the lighthearted, unpretentious tuneful musical that provides breezy entertainment without apology. One number, ""Be Handy With Your Feet,"" is actually rather catchy and fun, and shows Ruby Keeler off quite well. Even the chorines look like they're having fun. The casual opulence of the set (a kind of nightclub on an ocean liner) is another example of how even ""B"" films from a major studio gave a certain panache to frivolity far and above what was required. Overall, not bad at all.",1
6,"Ready Willing and Able (Warner Brothers, 1937). I finally had a chance to see this film and I have to admit, it's a cute little film from Warner Brothers in the late 30's. The actors seem like as though they are having a lot of fun and the musical numbers especially ""Too Marvelous for Words"" and ""Just a Quiet Evening"" are great. However, while watching this film, I feel a little sad for the late Ross Alexander who plays Barry Granville. Ross Alexander was very talented, nice looking, and had a great screen presence, but I guess Warners didn't know what to do with him. It seems as though his role was originally intended for Dick Powell, but he may have been unavailable. Keeler and Alexander have good screen chemistry and if he didn't die, maybe they would have made more films together.Overall, a nice way to pass time. Definitely check out it.",1
4,"So this seems to be a case of hard core porn director, Michel Caputo attempting to make it into the mainstream with the help of (possibly an old associate) legendary, Brigitte Lahaie. Must have seemed a good idea to make a straight film based around a bunch of pornographers, won't even need a story. Except in anything other than your usual fare, Mr. Caputo, you do need one and a believable one at that, unless the charm and action is going to carry things. Try as she might, however, Lahaie can't carry this by herself, never mind how much running around she does. Main trouble here (apart from all the 80s music and athletic dancing) is that it is all so implausible. We have an ageing lesbian who is supposed to be irresistible but looks more like a crazed prison warden (I suppose that could irresistible to some!) and a besotted police commissioner who could not even convince as a bobby on the beat.",-1
3,"Deeply unaffecting.A film populated by vegan vampires (look, no blood!) and apathetic zombies. The only reason aliens would abduct any of this lot, is to have a jolly good laugh at them (and I'm sure aliens wouldn't be that mean).",-1
4,"Was she actually abducted by aliens? For the love of Carl Sagan I have no idea.Here's what I do know. The new British indy ""Spaceship"" is among the most meaningless and morose masses of melancholia ever mish-mashed into a movie. Good GOSH these psych drug saturated sad sacks would make a damn dirge seem downright delightful.Hey Alex Taylor. It would appear you had lofty intentions whilst scripting and directing this catastrophic calamity. But in the end all you managed to muster is a miserable malaise of avant-garde posturing and pretense blown balistically out of proportion.Or more fittingly, out of this, or any other, UNIVERSE.",-1
1,"Another 'masterpiece; from BBC Films and the BFI. I have learned to expect boring, pretentious, pseudo-intellectual garbage when the logos of these two organisations appear in the opening credits and this 'epic' falls right into that category. If the director/auteur wanted to present a picture of teenagers today, he could have made a more entertaining piece by planting a static camera in a school cafeteria for an hour and a half - it would at least eliminate the 'arty' images and nonsense plot. It;s proof of your optimism that it will get better if you manage to endure the full 90 minutes of this incoherent rubbish. If you are considering watching this film, I would suggest finding some grass and watching it grow for 90 minutes instead.",-1
3,"...at least, not in this film, in which a lot of pretty visual and verbal ideas float around without ever finding a purpose.Full transparency: I met the writer/director Alex Taylor in the Tin Café in Hackney shortly after he completed this. He seemed a lovely guy, thoughtful and unassuming, so I really wanted to like his film.And I nearly did. It pulled off enough early on with its punky kids talking mock confident nonsense and grungy camera-work that I genuinely perked up. But I was flagging by the middle and even a little irritated as it wore on. There is a redemption arc, but it is not earned; there is a theme - of escape to another world - which is hammered too relentlessly and without enough narrative justification to weave any kind of spell; there are decently drawn characters who go nowhere; there is even a sort of twist, but it is not surprising.Still, hopefully all the potential presages something better from Taylor. And I'd say anyone interested in low-budget UK filmmaking should see this. It appears to indicate a funder openness to interesting approaches, and, at the same time, well, the bar doesn't seem set that high. Surely someone with a decent script can come along and knock one into this open goal? OK, good scripts - that's the hard part. Still...",-1
3,"...but it seems to meander from ""character"" to ""character"" with no real rhyme or reason. Fragmented to the point that it asserts a deeper meaning without ever actually seizing upon that deeper meaning. Visually interesting, but the narrative is confused by what it wants to be.There was clearly passion behind it, but passion alone doesn't make for a coherent or engaging story. It relies very heavily on voice overs that have this thematic constant of flight, better worlds, non humans or transcended humans...but all these threads, all these hooks...they never really tie together into anything. Yes, a film shouldn't always spoonfeed you answers, but there's a world of difference between leaving things open to interpretation and making an incoherent mess.This falls somewhere between the two. Never fully terrible enough to be a mess yet so vague that it straddles incoherence and repeats itself often. You keep trying to piece together the mystery it feels like it's presenting, but before long you realise that is an exercise in futility. Worse still is that despite how clever it thinks it may be, it commits the single greatest cardinal sin a movie can commit. It's boring. Pretentious I can sometimes enjoy, but pretentious and boring not so much.",-1
1,"This film has the look and feel as if some film students had numerous ideas for what they thought would be great psychedelic set pieces and then tried to cobble them together with a very,very thin storyline about a father trying to find his missing daughter.There are numerous secondary storyline arcs (an archaeological dig, a teenage vampire and a dominatrix and her slave) that make no sense around these set pieces that are accompanied by terrible synthesiser music and lots of slow motion of youngsters dancing, being high and chatting utter rubbish.Looking at the only adult in this film and essentially the person who holds the plotline together, the father, he teeters precariously on the borderline of caring father and middle aged pervert.Film is an artform and just because you put hi-glow paint on the actors does not make this film art !",-1
7,"A singular vision from a talented first time director, Spaceship journeys into the minds and souls of a group of teens in suburban Britain. Writer-director Alex Taylor takes a genre title, subverts it with a low-key premise, only to defy any and all expectations with a psychedelic head trip of a film, full of distinctive characters and faux-philosophical musings. A unique tone, expressive visuals and a knockout emotional finale keep things moving when the film threatens to meander into eternity.",1
2,"Caught this as LFF the other week. It's pretty awful. I think it's meant to be some revelatory insight into teen culture but there's no depth to any of the characters - they're just mouthpieces for the director's pseudo-intellectual, pseudo-philosophical stream of conscience stuff. There's not much of a plot - a girl possibly gets abducted by aliens - but the film doesn't have the guts to pursue that with any real intelligence. The writer/director introduced the film and seemed to think that the film was ""really weird"" and we should ""embrace the strangeness"", but I think there's a difference between being cleverly strange like Aronofsky or Korine to create an emotional response, versus whatever this is where the filmmaker seems to think that going on about unicorns and rainbows equates to enough depth to sustain the audiences interest. It doesn't. I will say that it looks very nice, there's a sequence at a party with day-glow neon make-up that looks great - but looking great isn't enough. The actors are interesting and some of them have real presence, it's just a shame they're forced to speak the rubbish dialogue.",-1
8,"A challenging, unexpected meander through teenage eyes. Both hallucinatory and strangely down to earth. Genuinely unique magical viewing with a cast who feel absolutely recognisable in their disengagement with the world around them. Spaceship is a development from Alex Taylors wonderful short film Lilly Goes to Kiss Land.",1
9,"An original piece from a promising director with some brilliant, spine-tingling moments and a perfectly matched soundtrack. It has a free form style aka Gummo, following teenagers and their weird and wonderful fantasies. Some scenes jar a little but if you accept them as part of the free-form style and recognise that in totality it's a collection of moments - you can just start to enjoy the experience for what it is: unlike pretty much any other film about teenagers out there. I recommend it if you like your films a bit different from the rest.",1
7,"The film is a sensitive, beautiful, dreamy and colourful look at teenage identity, sad at times, funny at other times. I laughed at one of the poems. It features good music - a grunge mixed ethereal sound and the young actors were believable. Overall it's a good debut and impressive talent.",1
9,"Watched this film without knowing much about it at the cinema, and was inspired by its fresh approach to filmmaking... It took me somewhere cool and mysterious... Been thinking about it for a while. Something quite David lynch about it... And easy on the eye and ear... I often find films nowadays about young people feel really exaggerated and somewhat unsettling, but this one has an authentic sensibility about it i really liked.... Something i haven't seen the cool linklater and larry clark 90s stuff... I liked it.",1
10,"Spaceship is a hidden gem of a film - a lyrical, semi-improvised film about cos-playing teens lost in a sea of angst and self-obsession. However, the film manages to avoid any sense of patronising the teenage experience or of indulging nostalgia in what it's like to be young. Like early Greg Araki, the film feels not just about teens but *by* teens, with a visual flair and a voice that feels authentic and sympathetic. The film captures beautifully the feeling of being simultaneously stuck where you've always been while also feeling so lost you might never be found. The visuals and music are superb and the young cast deliver understated, powerful performances. It's an unusual film for some, but it serves an audience that mainstream cinema can't reach.",1
8,"Went to see Alex Taylor's debut feature ""Spaceship"" in Brixton as part of the festival in early October 2016, and a phenomenal afternoon it turned out to be, indeed. Sadly, had to leave before the Q&A session after the end of the screening. Everybody in the auditorium looked well up for it!",1
9,"A refreshing take on youth-hood in modern Britain which pictures human as they are without any prejudice. A humble rock song in the shape of a movie which can entertain a mass open-minded crowd without too much screaming or shouting! In my opinion the art of film making is about storytelling. Well, Alex Taylor has mastered the story of 21st century human onboard of our crazy spaceship. The Spaceship is like me and you;sometimes charming, sometimes cruel but everyone are welcome onboard. Life is too short but the teenagers' life seems to go on forever on the Spaceship moving from past to the future. Welcome onboard people.",1
10,"I saw this film on Amazon and it was a total surprise. It's not like any other film I've seen. It really feels like the filmmaker tried to tell the teenagers stories with their own voice, not with their own. I wish more films were like this!",1
8,"Colonel O'Neill and Samantha are training four rookie Air Force cadets for the SGC. Out of the blue, aliens take over the SGC and Jack does not have anyone that he can trust but the cadets. He teams-up with the cadets and they enter in the SGC using a hidden exit to rescue Sam. What will happen to the SGC? Will they be capable to avoid the invasion?""Proving Ground"" is a predictable but entertaining episode of SG-1. It is quite obvious that everything is part of a drill to prepare the ""next generation"" of the explorers. The conclusion is a joke with the alarm activated again. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Proving Ground""",1
1,"This, like the other academy episode, was bad. The training scenarios, even the supposedly real scenarios, were fake looking. The characters acted as if they knew.The acting was bad. This was maybe the first appearance of ""somewhat cute Asian sci fi girl"" who lent her poor acting talents to the horrible Battlestar Galactica reboot, Sarah Connor Chronicles, and then Hawaii Five-0 Babies.This looked as bad as Wormhole EXreme, the purposely poorly acted, over the top, cheesy looking show within a show.Luckily I didn't have to sit through this episode first run on TV. I was able to fast forward through most of it.",-1
10,It's pretty amazing to watch how cadets are trained and tested in preparedness to join SG. O'Neill is a bit too firm and I feel bad for the cadet he kept reprimanding.I don't know what much to say but while some cases seem implausible (as it invariably does in SG1) I can't help but like how the future of SG would look like with these new recruits running it.There are obvious flaws but it's fresh and cozy. I can already see the future of SG with these new blood. I wish they would make a new one and hire them for a new SG. Atlantis' great but the cast here is excellent. 10/10,1
1,"I don't like the academy episodes of SG1 as the actors who potray the cadets are... Well... Bad actors... And very unlikebale. It seems the writers created this episode as an excuse to see what the SG1 team would look like if they were very young. But, they came across as just SG1 wannabes. You have a cadet for everyone of the SG1 team, but just... Unlikeable and wrong. Thus, this episode was just used as a filler and nothing more. It serves no other purpose. It doens't extend the storyline or fill any backstory. It's just there. It's just a cheap excuse for an SG1 episode. It seems like they had a half baked idea and decided to chuck it in because they needed to meet their demands for 22 episodes this season. A very bad and poorly written storyline. You can skip it if you want though.",-1
6,"I got this game because it was being put out by Atlus a company known for releasing some of the more interesting and unique games coming out of Japan, that and it looked like it might have an interesting story to it. It does have that, unfortunately the the main brunt of the game play is really annoying. It is fun during the day when you see the scenes and then at night before bed when you are at the bar. If more of the game play had been like that of the bar this one would have been much better as it was fun interacting with other patrons, drunk texting, sneaking a peek at some semi risqué pics on your cell phone and drinking various alcoholic beverages. To bad after you get to enjoy the highlight of the game you are then escorted to a nightmarish realm where the protagonist must climb various blocks to make his escape. It is not all bad, some levels were rather fun, but to many times I found myself cursing the screen as Vincent (the protagonist) plunged to his death multiple times or was killed in some other annoying way. I had the game set on easy too, which the narrator told me was for those of us more interested in the storyline which leads me to believe I made the right choice in picking easy because I would sure hate to witness anything more difficult. The story has a guy who is dating a woman named Katherine, a woman who is ready for a commitment while Vincent is kind of enjoying how things are currently going. Well he ends up waking up with another woman after a night at the bar and thus is caught between two women, Katherine a woman Vincent has known for a while and is serious about life and Catherine a younger girl who just wants to have a good time. His struggles seem to manifest themselves in the form of a strange dream where he is compelled to climb mountains of blocks. Strangely this strange realm is inhabited by a lot of sheep who give Vincent advice at times and at others try to impede his progress. However, Vincent soon learns these dreams are not simply being manufactured by his troubled mind as strange deaths seem to be occurring all over the city. Like I said the story had me hooked, just wish the game play was better as it seems like this portion of the game was rushed, while great detail was taken for the cut scenes and when you control Vincent in the bar. I would have preferred something more along the lines of Silent Hill 4 the Room, where he wakes up in some warped place and fights his way out rather than the climbing game we get. Also, the cover of this game and the M rating suggests this one is a lot more risqué than it actually is. You see nothing and it probably could have been rated T if not for all the cussing. They kind of oversold this angle as I have seen worse things in an R rated movie. So all in all a fun game to a point, if only they had worked on the dream stages a bit more, perhaps made them more varied and less frustrating as those boss levels really ramp up the annoyance factor. Still, the story balances it out a bit and overall I will say it is a fun game, just be prepared to pull your hair out if you are not like a gamer who plays games 24/7 and has no trouble playing any game.",1
8,"I am always hearing men asking what game they can play with their significant other. (Flower is the correct answer by the way.) Catherine is not the correct answer. It may seem as a simple game that deals with relationships and commitment. It isn't. The game tells you that you will be judged. If you play with your girlfriend or wife I guarantee you it won't just be the game judging you. First the good bits. This is surprisingly well written. Yes Katherine with a K is a bit of a trope as a harridan making her man grow up. Yet she isn't wrong and plenty of women in their early thirties struggle with the same issues with their partners. (Particularly partners that play video games and watch anime such as the audience for this game.) There is also a lot more depth to the story and characters than may first appear during the playthrough, The main gameplay is two-fold. One is sitting around a bar talking to patrons and friends and answering text messages. The game has multiple endings based on your actions but often I felt I didn't really have the ability to actually steer the story. I get the impression despite my diligence in talking to everyone I missed significant bits. It has a Mass effect on the ship feel but without as much apparent dialogue choice.The other main gameplay element is a climbing blocks puzzle reminiscent of Qbert. I, at times, hated it. It has a nasty difficulty spike halfway through and there is no way around it if you want to see the story (Playing on easy does not seem to make the puzzles themselves easier. It just gives you more money and lives) Speaking of lives the puzzle segments gives Dark Souls a run for its money. I can't remember seeing the you died screen this often in a game. To the game's credit however, the checkpoints are somewhat generous.This may be a game one has to play more than once to fully appreciate as I sense I had more freedom of choice than I realized. The block puzzles are tough and frustrating but the narrative is such that instead of giving up I struggled through and actually got better. If you like good more adult themed Anime and don't mind earning your pudding Catherine is an excellent game.",1
10,"If I had to pick one word to describe ""Catherine"", it would be ""intelligent."" True, there are other games I'd describe this way, but ""Catherine"" swaps typical shooting or brawling for puzzle-based gaming. It's a smart game that makes you feel smarter for playing it. And while there's a mature and (for the most part) smartly-written story and some fine-looking cutscenes and graphics, your enjoyment of the game will probably be determined directly by how addictive you find the puzzle mechanics.Framed as an episode of a late-night cable show, hosted by the enigmatic ""Midnight Venus"", the game, after an interesting (though long-winded) intro, throws players straight into the action. Vincent Brooks, the main character, is having a nightmare in which he must manipulate blocks in order to ascend a rapidly-crumbling tower. When he awakens, Vincent's life is complicated when his long-time girlfriend Katherine starts dropping some not-so-subtle hints that it might be time for the commitment phobic Vincent to buy her a ring, and when he hears a rumor going around his favorite bar that lousy boyfriends have been having a nightmare similar to his, and that if they fall in their dream, they end up dead on the morning news in real life.That night at the bar, Vincent's approached by gorgeous Catherine. Unlike brunette Katherine, blonde bombshell Catherine's a free-spirit looking for a good time, and, in a moment of weakness, Vincent shows her one. The story, a mixture of romantic comedy and supernatural horror, is told through a combination of stunning cell-shaded graphics and genuine anime cutscenes. The voice acting for the English dub is top- notch, with voices I recognized from my favorite video games and animated series.Gameplay takes place mainly in the nightmares, in which you must push and pull blocks to create a path up increasingly tall towers. These puzzles are actually pretty freeform, and different players will be able to improvise completely different paths to the pinnacle of each stage. Different types of blocks are added into the mix as you progress through the game, with various ""trap"" blocks requiring skill and timing to bypass.While the puzzles can sometimes be frustrating initially, on subsequent playthroughs you should come to look forward to the challenge of later stages and to find boss ""fights"" more rewarding. The boss battles, or, more accurately, boss chases, feature monstrous manifestations of Vincent's worries trying to kill him, forcing him to climb more quickly. This creates some of the game's more terrifying sequences, like one where Vincent is being chased by what I think was the ""beast with two backs"", firing hearts out of its . . . well, you'll just have to see for yourself.After completing each puzzle, you'll find yourself in a confessional booth where you'll be asked your thoughts on relationships. These questions are randomized each time you play and, along with questions you'll be asked by other characters on the landings between stages, where you're expected to encourage other lambs, and the Stray Sheep, Vincent's bar, as well as text messages you can send Catherine or Katherine, influence the game's nuanced morality system. Instead of pure ""good"" or ""evil"", the system is based on which of two viewpoints on relationships you lean more towards, with no consistent indication which choice will lean towards which polarity. Unfortunately, while these choices effect the NPC's around you, Vincent's story path will be the same for every player. Vincent's internal monologue at several points will change, and maybe a line of dialogue here and there will be different, but the story makes all the same stops no matter how many sweet texts you send to one girl and nasty texts you send to the other, at least until the game's finale, when your actions throughout the game will ultimately determine your alternate ending. However, scenes set in the Stray Sheep do a good job of capturing the feeling of relaxing at your favorite pub, allowing you to choose your responses to the texts from the women in Vincent's life, lend a sympathetic ear to the many interesting characters that make up the rest of the bar's regulars, and chat with Vincent's circle of drinking buddies and the bar's proprietor, the Robert Goulet-like ""Boss."" There's also a jukebox to change the accompanying BGM and an arcade booth to play a faux-retro version of the game. Of course, you can also pick your poison and drink, which not only gives Vincent a boost during the puzzle sequences but, in one of the game's finer touches, will also provide you with some interesting trivia tidbits on the liquor of your choice.Other clever touches include the quotes from famous writers and philosophers on love and marriage that display during the game's loading screens, or the game's great score. Original jazz compositions provide accompaniment for Stray Sheep sequences, while climbing sequences feature ultra-modern remixes of classical compositions by Beethoven, Bach, and the like. ""Catherine"", perhaps fittingly, is more of a commitment than it seems at first. On at least two separate occasions, I put the controller down, thinking I'd finished the game, only to be treated to a long series of cutscenes and then flung back into another puzzle. And while the game's central mystery provides a couple great twists, once the party responsible for Vincent's plight is revealed, the motivations behind the plot seem more than a little convoluted. Also, a final hosting segment after the game's conclusion beats players over the head with the game's themes.Other gameplay modes include Babel, a more randomized climbing puzzle that can be played single-handedly or cooperatively, and Colliseum, which is meant to be a competitive climbing mode but plays more like a tacked-on Deathmatch. In the end, it's the game's unique puzzles and interesting characters that made me want to play again as soon as I finished.",1

8,"During the 1940s, Columbia Pictures made mostly B movies--along with a few prestige pictures. Some, like ""Dangerous Blondes"" aren't exactly feature or B-films because their budgets are just a hair better than a B and because they are much longer than the usual B (which usually clock in at about 60 minutes). But, the film is clearly not a prestige picture, as it features mostly second-tier actors and no big-name actors at all. The closest to this are its stars Eveyln Keyes (who made a few big films) and Allyn Joslyn (a guy who always seemed to play excellent cranky supporting actors).This movie is much like a Thin Man film, but instead of rich Nick and Nora Charles, you've got the Craigs. Barry Craig is a crime fiction writer and he and his wife Jane prefer solving crimes to writing about them. As for the time in this film, it's far less important than the banter between them. It's filled with humor and I noticed MANY times my wife was laughing along with the film. My usually very picky wife declared that the film was kinda fun--a glowing endorsement, believe me! The dialog is the star, though Keyes and Joslyn sure did their best to make the film a lot of fun...if murder can be fun! Worth seeing and a shame they didn't make more of these films.By the way, during the radio show, Mr. Craig identified a 'revolver'. Well, I am not an expert on guns, but it clearly was a semi-automatic, not a revolver. Also, the radio show announcer was Don Wilson--who was more famous for his being a regular on ""The Jack Benny Program"".",1
7,"Delightfully witty, deceptive, clever and tricky, this murder mystery comedy farce gets going from the start. Detectives Frank Craven and William Demarest gave their hands full from the beginning with the sudden murder of a well known society matron, family scandal and more murders to follow. With Craven and Demarest close on their trails, the wacky team of Evelyn Keyes and Allyn Joslyn stay one step ahead of them, crushing every theory and breaking down every suspect as they outwit both the guilty and the law. It's pretty much Joslyn's show all the way, his street smarts mixing with his sophistication, although Nick Charles he ain't. Anita Louise, Ann Savage and Lynn Merrick are the other blondes, and there ain't a lady among them. Edmund Lowe, John Hubbard and Michael Duane are the more masculine of the supporting cast, and as it's determined who the guilty party is, you'll be both laughing and glued to your seat. It's one of the more well written B murder mystery comedies, lavishly filmed like an A picture, but giving character actors and second leads the chance to show what they can do in a supporting role.",1
6,"In the era of double features, DANGEROUS BLONDES most probably served as a pleasant second banana with a B-film budget from Columbia Studios, and a cast that included EVELYN KEYES, ALLYN JOSLYN, JOHN HUBBARD, EDMUND LOWE, ANITA LOUISE with WILLIAM DEMAREST and FRANK CRAVEN as detectives.It's a fast-paced comedy/mystery with the most unlikely turning out to be the killer but with very little character depth to make solving the puzzle a sensible thing to do. Instead, just sit back and enjoy the shenanigans of minor sleuths Keyes and Joslyn in a Nick and Nora mode as they plunge into discovering what's going on at a fashion studio where a murder takes place.Naturally, it takes lots of effort on their part and plenty of dangerous situations before they straighten the whole thing out with the cooperation of detective Craven and his sidekick, William Demarest.It's fun to watch pert EVELYN KEYES and ALLYN JOSLYN as her husband given some amusing situations in a tidy little mystery with the accent on comedy.",1
10,"Greatly enjoyed this mystery, comedy classic from 1943 starring Allyn Joslyn,(Barry Craig),""I Wake Up Screaming"" and Evelyn Keyes,(Jane Craig),""Gone With the Wind"". These two actors team up as a husband and wife detectives who try to solve a murder and seem to go around in complete circles through out the entire picture. This is really a comedy with plenty of 1943 jokes and laughter; there is an elevator operator who takes a year and a day to reach each floor and tells his complete life's history before you even reach the main lobby. Evelyn Keys was very young at the age of 27 and had not too long ago completed her appearance in ""Gone With The Wind"" 1939, where is gave an outstanding performance. Allyn Joslyn gave a great performance as a hen pecked detective who had a wife follow him every where he decided to go. Nice Classic Film and very entertaining.",1
6,"This B picture from Columbia features Allyn Joselyn trying to start a comedy mystery series of films. Thanks to William Demerest there are some funny moments. Evelyn Keyes provides the female part of this B picture which tries to be The Thin Man. Problem is they just don't have the script writing of the other series.Still the film has some decent moments with a writer trying to be a detective. The blondes are not as dangerous as they are in danger. The film fills the bill and catches the bad guys. The longest comedy bit is the elevator operator who seems to keep trying to rewind every trip to his experiences in the Spanish American war. He then keeps missing the floor he is supposed to be stopping at, to the disdain of his passengers.It fit the under bill of this type of film for the double features of the 1940's in theaters well. Good enough to keep people waiting for the A feature.",1
4,"Crime writer Allyn Joslyn (Barry) and his wife Evelyn Keyes (Jane) set out to solve the murder of Mary Forbes (Isabel Fleming) at a photographer's studio. The police are also trying to figure things out led by Frank Craven (Inspector Clinton). It's a comedy detective film that also stars William Demarest (Detective Gatlin), so be warned.Shame it's a comedy. The film's title lends itself to a film-noir storyline. Anyway, whilst there are some funny moments, this is offset by annoying comedy characters that fail to generate any laughs – Demarest being one, and housekeeper Minerva Urecal (Mrs Swanson) being another. The story is slightly complicated and it's all pretty meaningless but Evelyn Keyes stands out and is fun to watch. And the luminous paint is cool.If you see William Demarest on a cast list, it's a dead cert that the film is one to avoid. He's his usual unfunny self here with exaggerated expressions, unrealistic reactions, obvious and badly executed pratfalls and way too much screen time. This film was doomed.",-1
10,"Dangerous Blondes is one of the choice nuggets that sits in the Columbia archives waiting for rediscovery.  It appeared briefly on television in the fifties and sixties but is not in the current package available to television stations.  Pity because it is chock full of wonderful performances, nice musical arrangements, excellent direction and a fun story. It is a comedy murder mystery that tries to prove that a writer of detective novels can be as smart as a real police detective.  Evelyn Keyes never looked more beautiful than here as she helps her husband in trying to solve a recent rash of murders.The comedy in this 81 minute lost classic is as quick and witty as you are likely to see in a film of the period and the joy in finding this treasure again will be music to the ears and eyes of film lovers everywhere.",1
7,"A classic and pleasantly produced film. The principle character's on screen rapport is spot on and the atmospheric sets of the various scenes throughout the movie will keep you entertained. Even with the comic relief which this film largely generates, the sense of mystery and intrigue is never too far behind. As an added touch of class. seeing Dwight Frye playing one of the hoods was great yet also bitter-sweet. Although uttering a gruff ""shut up"" to Ms. Keyes, in a very funny and frantic scene, he offers no dialogue, but his facial expressions in the precious rare scenes he's on screen is PRICELESS. Notably, there is an eerie and ironic side note to Frye's tie in to this movie. ""Dangerous Blondes"" would be his last film. He tragically died of a fatal heart attack shortly after this movie wrapped and get this, the title of the book for which this film was based was called, ""If The Shroud Fits,"". Also, actor Emmett Vogan who played a medical officer in this film, was a stock player in his and Dwights's early days in theater. He acted along side Frye in Denver and Spokane. Such a sobering distinction for Vogan to appear with the ill-fated Mr. Frye at not only the beginning of Dwight's career in acting, but also his final work as well.",1
10,"This is without a doubt the best Musical Theatre concert ever filmed! Johnathan Pryce and Liz Robertson as Higgins and Liza in the My Fair Lady sequence are outstanding! Dame Judi Dench mezmerizes the audience with Send in the clown's, Tom Leherer sings gleefully about ""poisoning pidgeons in the park"". You also get the outstanding Bernadette Peters and the Sexy and talented Ruthie Henshall.A rare treat is also given when Musical Theare rivals Stephen Sondheim and Andrew Lloyd Weber perform a fun duet roasting Mackintosh.Bravo to both of them for their sportsmanship. True, the special could do without the Phantom and Martin Guarre selections but its does not hamper the enjoyment in the least. I still could have watched an hour or so more of this concert. I just did not want it to end.",1
9,"June 1998 at The Lyceum Theatre, London. Somehow, over 200 actors and dancers and singers all crammed into this theatre for an evening of unforgettable entertainment. (In fact, 2 performances were given  7 and 8 June, the second one being the Royal gala charity that was filmed.) Over nearly three hours we are guided through highlights of 26 shows produced by one man over 30 years or so. Cameron Mackintosh. Many of the original casts reprise their roles, and many more stars are on hand to add to the glitter. There are some fairly rare appearances, too. Millicent Martin, David Kernan and Julie Mackenzie do a bit from 'Side by Side by Sondheim' and Tom Lehrer sings a song of his that was used in 'TomFoolery.' Dame Judi Dench sings an unforgettable 'Send in the Clowns' and Andrew Lloyd Webber and Stephen Sondheim do a duet (!) And . one could go on all night! The list of shows and cast would do justice to a dictionary of musical theatre. It is a splendid tribute to the indefatigable talent of 'Mr. Producer' Mackintosh. I think there are two items cut from the DVD. The opening medley number of Act 2 and one of the Tom Lehrer numbers. But no matter, this is without doubt a stunning achievement by all concerned.'The best bits' will clearly depend on your own likes and dislikes. For me, the Sondheim numbers were the highlight. The man's a genius. It should be mentioned that nearly all the numbers are fully staged and costumed. (The logistics of this are mind-numbing!) They are not just a gaggle of stars in evening dress. The big 'production numbers' are spectacular  especially 'Cats' and the final piece from 'Les Miserables'. If you have any love or interest at all in musical theatre, this DVD is a 'must'. There is no on-screen info about the numbers coming up or the artists performing them. I feel this is something that could easily have been remedied. However, a listing can be found in the archive section of Albermarle of London website. (www.albermarle-london.com)",1
10,"I am a self-proclaimed musical theater fanatic (understatement, I assure you). Be that as it may, this video was the most brilliant musical revue I have ever seen (also an understatement!) If you have any passion for musical theater whatsoever, you MUST see this!The theater has always been my joy, but I never thought I would see so many showstoppers by so many theater legends in a three-hour period. I mean, Julie Andrews, Bernadette Peters, Lea Salonga, Jonathan Pryce, Colm Wilkinson, Ellen Greene...the list goes on and on and on.
The amazingly prolific career of Cameron Mackintosh is portrayed without flaw...everything from Oliver to Cats to Carousel to Les Miserables. Les Miserables is my favorite musical, but I still love this more (if possible) than the Les Miz Tenth Anniversary Concert because it includes so much more from the brilliance of the stage. My personal favorites were ""The American Dream,"" performed perfectly sleazily by Jonathan Pryce; Lea Salonga in EVERYTHING, she is SO amazing; and ""One Day More,"" (The song never gets old, I came <This> close to COMPLETELY losing it). In short, a must-see for anyone with a passion",1
10,"I loved watching this show. It had a great display of talent, all parts were great but some of my favorite parts were:1. The American Dream segment, Jonathan Pryce was great as The Engineer and does a phenomenal job in the role.2. One Day More Segment, one of those songs I can watch being preformed repetitively, Colm Wilkinson is fantastic as well as the rest of the cast (though I still profess Terrence Mann is the best Javert).3. Oh, What a Beautiful Morning, ahh... the days when Hugh Jackman was not a mega-star, nice to see his musical roots later shown in Boy From Oz.",1
9,"A GREAT line-up of actors and actresses. however with one or two bad picks, in my opinion. And they butcher some of the songs, though they had to to fit all these things into just three hours. A very, VERY good video nonetheless. :o)",1
10,"Hey Mr. Producer is an awesome collection of musicals done by Cameron MacKintosh.  If you love musicals, you'll love this.  It is wonderfully done.  I enjoyed the selections from Les Miserables, Oliver, CATS, and My Fair Lady.",1
10,"I love Leah Salonga, the original Miss Saigon, a truly amazing talent from the Philippines. She is brilliant, spectacular, fabulous and the best singer I have seen in the West End of London.The original cast of Les Miserables was also brilliant.I totally agree with Stepahie K, Liz Robertson didn't quite make the standard as Eliza that Julie Andrews set, and Bernadette Peters wasn't as good as she normally is, she sounded really tired. Although some of the singers looked tired and were not as brilliant as seen on stage years ago, they still performed quite well.The video is a culmination of all the best musicals in the West End of London and the brilliance of Sir Cameron Mackintosh. A must for everyone to buy and keep forever.",1
10,"I put the DVD into the machine yesterday morning without any idea what it was going to be like. Two hours later (three, actually, cause I kept repeating it) I walked out the room swaying from side to side, laughing cause I was think of the jokes there, and wholeheartedly impressed. It was the greatest show I had ever seen.This is just one of those things that you JUST CAN'T MISS (that's why I'm forcing my other friends to watch it). Every single performer, from the host Julie Andrews to the singers to the dancers to the sound effect guys was absolutely fantastic. The show was just...absolutely fantastic. Bernadette Peters, Jonathan Pryce, Lea Salonga, Colm Wilkinson and Andrew Lloyd Webber (regarding to his little performance)are one of my many favorites. Greatest concert ever. Just...go and watch it. It' pays off. Seriously.",1
10,"What the acting lacks, the story makes up for many times over! I was touched and spiritually blessed, even my hubby stayed up to watch which says a lot. Thank you Jesus for people who still care about their neighbors.",1
3,The story is good. However the acting is bad and not convincing at all. The camera works are boring and old fashioned. I would rate this movie not higher then a 4.5 out of 10,-1
10,This has a good messege. Doesn't have the best film quality.,1
5,"I have to say this anime was rather colourful and the art of it was quite nice too but I just felt character development was badly affected here in my personal opinon. Although the girls that are on this look different, they all act pretty much the same typical ""look at me im just so adorable"" kind of attitude which is rather irritating. It would be better if all had different unique personalities to make me watch more of the show.",-1
9,"Love the story so far I wish they would have more episodes.
We can tell they want to start a romantic relationship with Mai and Haruhiko just need to make more episodes to make that happen.
Great characters another anime filled with Waifu's 😂😀😃",1
10,"Mark Romanek (director of the thriller ""One Hour Photo"") is one of the best directors of music videos, and one of the most influential as well. In this collection of his works, the viewer is able to appreciate his unique visual style, with a lot of care of the atmosphere and the visual aspect of each short, fitting it quite well with the tone of each song. Music videos like ""Closer"" from Nine Inch Nails or ""Bedtime Stories"" from Madonna are enough examples of his talent and care for the details, showing us disturbing, yet beautiful and memorable images, that you could only see in a dream. The influence of his work can be appreciated even feature length films as ""The Cell"" or ""The Fall"" which share many thing in common with the fantastic music videos from Mark Romanek. This is a great collection. I highly recommend it.",1
1,Anyone rating this with 10 stars (or even 2) is lying.,-1
8,Enjoying it. Delilah's life is full of happenings. Good story.,1
4,"Why is it that shows (e.g. Opra's) that shout aloud about equal representation produce shows that are far from it? The cast is 95% black and what white people there are, are obviously in need of being told how to be and/or privileged in power and wealth to be taken down.It is filled with confused tropes which supposedly show how it is and what strong black people look and feel like in a realistic manner - whilst breezing over black people being constrained by other black people living to the stereotypes. Yeah. OK. There I was thinking that stereotyping is bad but apparently if it's aimed at the privileged and all of those with presumed power (white people) to spotlight past your own community's it's fine.A definite do as I assume and not like I do.",-1
10,"I'm looking forward to the storyline in this drama. I really enjoyed the first episode. Good actors, so let's see where they take us.",1
1,This is written by men a black one and a white one and neither know how black women operate and it shows. I gave it a try because it was a black show but it leaves a lot to be desired. Alot of the situations don't even make sense and wouldn't be allowed in the real world legally. No one bothered to do any real research.,-1
8,"This show is entertaining. Opposing lawyers sharing info in a case they are on opposing sides is hard to believe. However, the characters are strong and you have suspend belief in most shows anyway.",1
8,"I really enjoy this show! I can't believe people are on here complaining that 95% of the cast on this show is Black. So what! 95% of the people on the vast majority of other networks are white. Do you complain about that? Of course not! Yes, this show does count as equal representation because there are so few shows with a majority Black cast. And even fewer where the Black people aren't portrayed as lower class, broke, and always struggling, or loud and obnoxious for no reason (ie, most Tyler Perry shows). I was never a fan of Oprah's talk show, but I applaud her for finally producing shows that portray educated, gainfully employed, cultured, middle to upper middle class Black Americans. We do exist, and it's nice to see people who look and live like us being represented. I also like that the show does not shy away from showing some of the nonsense we have to put up with when being ""the only"" at certain higher levels in the workplace. I could do without all the god/religion references, but I can understand why that's in there. Lastly, if you don't want to see a show with mostly Black people, why are you even watching OWN original programming? Go watch one of the countless other networks where it's pretty much all white folks all the time, with the occasional minority sidekick.",1
8,I ditto there are plenty and still plenty of shows with all white cast. Shows I enjoy. Why does it bother you that there is probably one show 95% black cast? That is a question you should ask yourself if you're complaining.I enjoy this show and like to see where the story continues to go.I wish it was advertised more. I try and tell people about it.I do enjoy it. Hope it renews another season.,1
10,I hope there is plenty of seasons to come because 8 episodes isn't enough...💯👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽BRAVO ENCORE.,1
8,Not everyone is perfect but they are living a relatable life. I am so in and I hope it doesn't get canceled.,1
7,"This film is beautiful and stylish, witty clever and funny but I don't think a dark comedy, as one reviewer called it here is an apt title, I think it meant to be a satire but because it's so funny and elegant most of its barbs end up feeling like tickles. So we chuckle or laugh when we should've moved uncomfortably in our chairs hiding our faces with shame.The other fault it has is a failure to build real human characters. Both of the leads come out as made up creatures, especially so the mother that doesn't create even the slightest empathy to her plight. The daughter, who's being played by the film's writer-director Amalia Ulman does get a fair share of character building moments but every time we start developing any empathy for her the film takes a step back and alienates us from her again. So we may laugh and chuckle but I think that's not the emotions the film aimed for. In fact I don't think that's the emotions the film should've aimed for.",1
6,The film stars the director and her actual mother in a quirky film about 2 fashionistas falling on hard times in a seaside town in Spain.They are scrappy women who try to work any angle that might present itself but they are unable to abandon their zest for fashion and the luxe life that once was theirs.The cinematography is superb including the scenes of many of the town's elders walking by deserted shops and residences.The director makes serious points using a creative use of telling scenes that somehow are also touched with humor.,1
10,"Playful and meditative in equal turns, El Planeta is a unique feature film debut - a re-invention of auteur cinema for the Internet age, and the arrival of a Amalia Ulman as a visionary director. It is a timely story about an unconventional millennial family, aspirational consumer culture, capitalism and failure. It feels relevant, fresh and non-conformist in both its content and execution, yet never confrontational.Amalia's impact in shaping contemporary art and culture is already undeniable. In 2014, Amalia Ulman crossed over from a small community of young ""post-Internet"" artists to international fame with her project, ""Excellences and Perfections."" Google the project or Amalia's name and you'll find plenty of documentation. I've followed her artwork since then, and when I saw Amalia was going to make a feature film, of course I was interested in knowing more and got a ticket to see it at Sundance 2021.I'm not sure exactly what I expected when I started the film, but needless to say I was very impressed. The film is deliberate, slow, punctuated by memorable scenes. You find yourself drawn more and more into the lives of the characters María and Leonor, a mother and daughter facing eviction in Gijón, Asturias. Their everyday lives are rendered timelessly, yet with an eye to contemporary detail - seeing an Odwalla1221 sweater in a movie I almost did a double take, as it was like seeing something from my social media timeline materialize into a cinematic universe.I don't want to give too much of the film away as it has not been widely released yet, but what I loved most about the film - what inspired me the most - is that the film is made with a profound amount of respect for storytelling and the audience, rather than forcing her way of seeing the world onto us. In this way, El Planeta rewards the viewer with a generosity of spirit. It's a testimony to Amalia's incredible ability to inhabit and work from within different media forms that she was able to take independent cinema on its terms and craft a well-paced, stylish drama as her feature debut. I look forward to seeing what she'll make next!",1
10,"Clever, stylish and subtle, El Planeta made me wish more indie movies got made today! We need such vantages into the world",1
8,"A mother and daughter each do their best to fail upwards after being abandoned by the family patriarch. They do so with humor and grace. Beautifully shot in digital black and white, the washed-up backgrounds of post-recession Gijon, Spain tell their own story through a dry, saline sense of time and warmth. For fans of nouvelle-vague, Miranda July. The fullest expression of director/star Ulman's artistic vision to date.",1
7,"El Planeta tracks soon-to-be evicted mother-daughter grifters, María Rendueles and Leonor (or Leo) Jimenez, in the aftermath of the 2008-2014 Spanish financial crisis. Based on real life mother-daughter scammers, Justina and Ana Belén (Las Falsas Ricas de Gijón), who swindled up to 6000 euros in restaurants and establishments in Gijón.María and Leo follow a similar trajectory in the picaresque film, often finding replenishment in each other's company in an otherwise starved world. Many scenes present portraits of idle time. Shots are often stationary, long and wide with few closeups, reminiscent of Claire Denis, tinged with the domestic intimacies of Hong Sang-soo, and Jim Jarmusch's unhurried, deadpan black and white early work. Enveloped by the vast oceanic landscapes of the bored port of Gijón, Ulman's hometown, the city's dead-endedness evokes the silent desperation of Peter Bogdanovich's The Last Picture Show (1971). The city is desolate, almost entirely populated by eldery people, with most of its businesses permanently closed and shrouded in for sale signs, wood, and graffiti. The world is built entirely around money, all María and Leo can inevitably do is wait for the government to figure out they don't have it and later be escorted to society's exit. Still, the two choose to retain some agency and personal sense of dignity as they opt to exit well-dressed and freshly manicured by controlling the last thing they have left, their bodies.",1
4,"As awful as this is as a piece of film-making, it is pure comedy gold. The entire production reeks of egotism and pomposity, and the whole thing is amplified by the fact that nobody involved seems to realize how outrageous the whole thing is. The whole thing is really a tribute to Shatner's massive ego- though, to be fair, he does seem to have a sense of humour about it. Even the title is a pompous and pointless misspelling (how is ""Spplat"" pronounced differently than ""Splat""?).I should add that the advertisements for ""Creative Light Entertainment"" that come before the movie starts are even funnier than ""Spplat Attack"" itself.",-1
6,"It turns out that Shatner is, in fact, Kirk. On more than one occasion during this very silly movie, Shatner manages to come out on top of potentially disastrous paintball scenarios. I came away from this surprised at how wily Shatner really is. The camera work is not amateur so much as it is unprofessional. It's much like watching a Shatner family home movie. I have never been involved in paintball, so it was fascinating to see how riled up these people get about their paintball.However, this movie is certainly not for everyone. If you're not a big Shatner fan than you're better off watching Friends reruns.",1
1,"At best this could be described as an 80 minute home movie. In fact, a number of shots show the cameras involved, and they are mere consumer grade camcorders... without anti-shaking features apparently. Many scenes rivaled Blair Witch Project in its lack ability to keep things stable. Terrible panning shots in an effort to keep up with the action. Just thinking about it again makes me want to puke.Don't watch.",-1
10,"I's seems a bit impossible to put my emotion into words here... But i'll try! Spplat Attack from 2002 has to ""bee"" the best movie ever since the Little Bee movie from Brazil, with amazing characters portrayed as the wonderful actor William Shatting, which got most of he's face from the Star Trek series and Homestuck. The plot of this movie is simply... Cleaning! (My way of saying thrilling to be in the theme of the movie funny joke) And has to have one of the nicest home made soundtracks ever, with some of the musicians reminding me allot of Death Grips. I simply feel sad that other humans on this planet cannot simply comprehend the quality and effort of this film, like if you see all of these scores on IMDb, you will notice they are all low... That simply sickens me, I believe i can live in a world in which this doesn't have to be tolerated by sane warriors like myself. It also makes me sad that people such as feminists ruin all the fun for all the men in this entire universe! C,mon it was just a joke. These things I just said where quotes from the movie and not actually my ramblings, trust me... I'm a reviewer and I know how to properly review a movie. In a nutshell, you should watch this movie, it is by far the best movie to include cleaning and vice versa. Peace out.",1
8,"I first saw this on ESPN2 at 3 in the morning about 4 months ago being and Shanter fan i kept it on hoping that it would help me fight my insomnia. Fortunately, it dragged me in like every paintball game i have ever played it is true to the sport in every way and takes a fast, lighthearted, approach to a great event. the shaky camera's and poor editing just adds to the fun of it all. To call this this piece of film terrible is missing the point. All you can do is rent this at block buster and laugh at how outrageous the idea of a 70 year old Shanter playing paintball is. Then revel in the hilarity of it all.",1
7,"Negatives: Tended to drag on & on (four long DVDs). Confusing at times w/flashbacks. Difficult to follow who's who while also watching subtitling. Then there's going back in time - not possible at all, sorry, future yes. Although a watch as time travel tool is an easily understandable visual it just makes zero sense - but who cares.
Positives: Good acting. Very philosophical about relations & aging. Death is quite real & personable.",1
8,"The light in your eyes is an odd, surprising drama. It is not what is seemed to be. The story started as a comedy, then it turned into a fantasy drama, and, eventually, it all made sense. The dramatic, melodrama element was really good and the family dynamics touching and strong. The comedy element, however, could have been a bit less, as the story was very dark and sometimes it didn't blend well with it. I also enjoyed the slice of life concept. But the highlight of the drama was the performances that were really good by everyone in the cast, though the younger version of the leading lady kind of didn't match with her older version. Finally, the twist in the ending was probably one of the best twists I've ever watched. So, 8 out of 10.",1
7,"I am a fan, so I was looking forward to this K-Drama when I read the description. But the actual series is not as described. That would be okay if the twist worked fully, but for me it does not. The series does have its moments, but I see too many plot holes, including the way a major character (her son) is treated that is reprehensible and never really atoned for except in hindsight. He ended up living the same life as his beautiful dad, and it's too late for him; no snow sweeping can make up for that. It was naive of the writer to suggest it could. For me, if a narrative surprise doesn't fully account for everything the story raises, then it is undercut. On the other hand, I do appreciate the respect for seniors and the gentle depiction of Alzheimer's. And I love the performances of talented Nam Joo Hyuk and the beautiful Kim Hye Ja who gives an acting class in every scene. She is breathtaking.",1
5,"The Light in Your Eyes was an odd show that had some really triumphant and amazing episodes and moments, but it failed in a lot of other episodes - it honestly felt like 3 different shows mashed up into one. As another reviewer accurately pointed out, it was a fantasy, a comedy, and a melodrama. Unfortunately, I didn't feel that these three elements were blended seamlessly, but rather it felt like 3 shows, or even 3 plot arcs that turned out to be rather disconnected. The ending episode where the viewer finally knows what is really going on had the best of the 3 plots, and I feel that this element would have worked well as a movie instead of a show. Once you know the ending, most of the show feels rather pointless. The twist at the end definitely had an impact, but I feel like that was more because the prefacing episodes didn't really make that much sense, rather than because of carefully laid plot points.Overall I thought this was well acted, the soundtrack is enjoyable and beautiful, but ultimately I was left a bit disappointed. I don't think I would recommend this show.",-1
8,"I think it is too philosophical a drama for the intended audience and slow in the process but nothing is what it seems in at least the first 10 chapters, it has a plot twist from another world and it is not radiant, it is nostalgic but wonderful.",1
7,"The drama tried to catch emotion but only resulted average performance compared to many good dramas. The characters scene and story of the noodle shop lady with the brother were disasters and total failure nonsenses that wasted viewers precious time and wasted film. What on earth did the writer and the fool director were thinking?The first episode was a good pickup but as you watch further, every episode deteriorated further. Episodes 10/12 and 11/12 were the worse that totally wasted viewers time. They tried to major catch sentiments in the last episode but still only average, nothing big deal. The last episode ahs some minor nonsenses but still able to swallow but episodes 10 and 11 were unable to swallow at all.Overall this drama can be watched if no other dramas to watch because 12 episodes is a fast drama to finish. If this drama was above 20 episodes, I will not watch it.",1
8,"I found this drama surprising and it was worth watching just for the amazing performances that the entire cast delivered. Truly exquisite. I could not score it 10/10 because I think it's not flawless plot wise but it's most certainly worth the 12 plus hours I spent watching it. Some really beautiful moments that will remain with me, and performances I won't forget. Beautiful.",1
9,"Do not watch this series if you are looking for a typical romance/fantasy kdrama for light entertainment. Coming into the show I knew there would be something unexpected and unconventional but it still took me by surprise.I agree with another reviewer who said the comedy and much heavier and darker portions do not always blend well. Following the plot and time jumps is also not easy, resulting in frequent confusion in the storyline. However, the one constant throughout the entire show is the amazingly lovable character of the old lady and the fantastic performance of the actress Kim Hye-ja. If it were not for her, I probably would have dropped the show in the middle. I hanged on through the disappointments and sadness because I believe there must be light at the end of the tunnel and I desperately wanted to see her happy.Without spoiling anything, the 'big twist' comes towards the last few episodes but not at the very end, so it has plenty of time to properly develop its storyline till the ending. In this sense, after going through all the misfortune of our heroine and her family, and having many questions with the plot line unanswered, everything suddenly came together in a natural and believable way. Not bad for a fantasy drama!I'll conclude by saying it is not easy to rate this show. It is not light entertainment by any means so your level of enjoyment will greatly depend on your ability to appreciate a good story told in a very unconventional way, despite its flaws.",1
10,"The curfews and police brutality were real. The fashions and hairstyles were real. It was almost shocking to see the gender roles so accurately portrayed - not according to today's stereotype but how they were in reality, back then.I think I just marked myself as a bit older than the average KDrama viewer.That puts me in a position to confirm the depicted ageism and snide comments as real and ongoing. The need for elders to be seen as still valuable and wanted. The callousness of grown children who, for decades, nurse their grievances and stubbornly refuse to see their parents as people, not just as their mommies and daddies - all of it, so true.From a technical perspective, this was spot-on. The writing, the acting - OMG! The acting!, the camera angles and cinematography: all excellent.The story: mind blowing. Stunning. Jaw-dropping. A must-see.P. S.: bring lots of tissues.",1
10,"One of best TV series I've ever watched... truly an emotional rollercoaster of how life can be surprising. I'm not going give any synopsis of this series and ruin the surprise your truly inn for.If you're a Drama lover, this is the show for you. It takes you through the series of life's ups and downs. It's heartbreaking, you might bleed in tears but it sort of makes you realise many things about your loved ones done for you. And life is so fragile and passing so fast, we don't even realise it.So take it easy, live your everyday to the fullest. Tomorrow can wait, past is gone, live your present completely devoted to happiness and things that matter",1
5,"I've actually become a huge fan of K-dramas, and have watched maybe 25-30 over the last year or so. So far, this is the only one that I have given below a 8/10 rating. Now, even though many of the stories can vary greatly, they usually share similar basic plot points; however this one is something completely different than usual, or than you're lead to expect. I won't give any spoilers, but I freely admit that overall, this wasn't my cup of tea, I'm sure many will enjoy the different approach and time jumps back & forth, and the plot twists as well. What you will find here is some touching & realistic portrayals of some of the difficulties & hardships around aging, family issues, as well as some abusive situations. The acting throughout is very good, and the chemistry between the two main leads is good, and actually made me want to see them together in a more conventional romantic drama. So, let me conclude with this; if you are drawn to this movie because of an expectation of a romantic film about time travel involving the two leads, you may be disappointed. If you want to see a movie about aging, family relations, regrets, & insights into perceptions of the elderly about how they view their past, present and future, this might be for you.",-1
10,"Beautiful, must watch drama!!! Its one of the best that I have watched till date.
Amazing storyline, loved the twist and the actors stayed true to their role.To all the viewers who want to watch this, make sure to not skip anything of this series from ep 1-10. The end of episode 10 will blow your mind. The 11th and 12th episodes shows the life of Hye-ja.--SPOILERS---""It feels like I woke up from a long dream, but I'm not sure if it was the younger me dreaming of when I was old, or the older me dreaming of when I was young""This line at the end of episode 10 blew up my mind and finally all the broken pieces fit perfectly. I thought this might be a typical time travel story and was curious on how a time travel watch would resolve the situation that Hye-Ja was in.
But turns out it's not needed. There was no time travel to begin with. It was a situation entirely made up by old Hye-Ja who is suffering from Alzheimer. This twist made the whole drama very interesting. The finale was heart wrenching were her son was finally able to understand his mother. I could not think any better ending in the finale.",1
10,"If you want typical romantic kdramas or that kind of fantasy ones, this drama is not for you.
It has such a deep meanings and wonderful acting. The surprising ending is the best and you feel that the whole experience has been changed for awhile. I just love it. Watch it if you feel that something doesn't make sense, wait for the end.",1
10,"A very good show with wonderful story. Acting of all 3 lead actors is amazing. It tells u about life and old age. It should be a highly watched show as its truly lovely
Ps U will cry in last 2 episodes",1
8,"I have been watching dramas for many years and I haven't been that moved since...I don't even recall. At the beginning it just looks like your typical funny/romantic/fantasy drama but, and this is a ""BUT"", it has so much more to offer. The topics that are covered are deeper than thought and anyone can relate to them, in the sense that it is a society issue. The outcome is just ""dazzling"", and could leave anyone speechless.
To finish, the 3 main actors are also great and especially Kim Hye Ja, she completely deserved her award.
Recommended 100%",1
10,I literally cried with it. it was really beautiful and heartwarming,1
10,"This drama series is not a typical romance / fantasy series... it's one that explores our lives and deeper experiences we take from them. One of the reviews mentioned that the comedy was 'odd', but I believe that these lighthearted moments were meant to be there... Despite challenges, the comedic aspects helped highlight that the lives of these characters wasn't all pain, but that they also had their moments of fun. In my opinion, the drama showed us how we wish it was either all dark or all comedy, but it isn't..because that's reality. In fact, it's what makes life so meaningful, so beautiful, and worth holding onto. It shows just how easy it is to dismiss our brighter moments. Beautifully written. I saw it a second time, knowing what to expect, which made me appreciate all the little scenes that was included in the drama. You can not call this drama 'slow', especially when it is only 12 episodes...it was all exquisitely made.",1
7,"This episode leans to the comic as Ronald Reagan plays the colorful and somewhat notorious California financier William Chapman Ralston. The way Reagan does finance he has the guts of a burglar.And he'll need that in conning the head of the San Francisco Mint played by Judson Pratt. The time is 1869 and there is a panic brought on by some speculation. The back story of that is in the east where Jay Gould and Jim Fisk are trying to corner the gold market. That's not explained here, what is explained is that the Bank of California which Ralston founded is in danger of going under and the man needs specie as paper money will not satisfy the depositors should there be a run.I won't go into the con game that Reagan plays, but it has to do with the vanity of a man not willing to admit to certain limits that getting older imposes. With it Reagan manages to get San Francisco safe from the panic sweeping the country. Six years later William Chapman Ralston dies, possibly of accidental drowning, possibly of suicide when he overextended himself credit wise during another financial panic. But Reagan in this plays one of the more lighthearted parts I ever saw him in before going into politics.",1
4,"This show started good but by the 3rd episode it's showing it's anti-American sentiments. As soon as the Muslim wife started talking about all the hatred she experiences on a daily basis, I had to roll my eyes. As American's, we are treated to constant rhetoric about how bad we are. We are so sick of the barrage of propaganda telling us we're bad for not loving every Muslim on the planet. I've hardly even met any Muslims, but somehow I'm oppressing them, along with my whole race. Why are you doing this? Why are you feeding me this crappy tv show that tells how white Americans just want to make war with Muslims? What's wrong with you?",-1
1,Seems like once again the pc thing is to paint all of white America with the anti Islamic brush which starts at the point where the Islamic lady says she's been subject to so much hatred in America which makes you wonder if its so bad why do so many Muslims live there ....oh and try being American in a Muslim country and you'll know what hatred on another level is.....but they wouldn't make a show like that would they?,-1
1,"As another reviewer said, the first couple episodes were good but then they give us this drivel. The big bad white government man just wants to frame muslims as terrorists so he can continue warring with them. The Quran forbids suicide. Someone should tell all the Islamic terrorists of the world that they've been reading their holy book wrong because they sure do love blowing themselves up. I think my eyes must have completely disappeared inside my head from rolling so hard when I had to listen to that woman talking about how she lives in fear every day. At least the BBC show Bodyguard was not afraid to show Islamic terrorism as it is rather than trying to make a scapegoat white man villain.",-1
6,"So in this episode Rachel gets promoted and needs to get a new assistant. Her getting a crush on Tag is slightly annoying, plus I didn't find it too funny that someone who has more experience but is older is not getting a job because of young guy with no experience.Chandler, Monica and Ross telling each other all the secrets is kind of funny to some point, but again most of the things that are told are not that much fun. Sure it is funny when a straight guy makes a mistake and kisses a guy, but in this episode it was made as if kissing a guy is such a horrible thing which gives Friends a very homophobic feelingJoey has the best story in this episode although there isn't that much going on in it either",1
5,"Yes, elements of the Chandler/Ross/Monica storyline aren't very PC by today's standards, but it's still a decent plot in a decent episode, without being spectacular.Personally I was more concerned with the Rachel storyline - the story with her and Tag never really worked for me.Nice to see a fun subplot with Joey too.Ok overall, nothing amazing, a bit like the 7th series of the show in general.",-1
10,"I love this episode, it's really funny. There are so many funny moments in this episode. Every minute has a joke that makes me laugh.In this episode, Joey is offered a job back on Days Of Our Lives as Drake's twin brother, Striker, but Joey thinks he's offered the role, not an audition. So he goes in and refuses to read lines, so he doesn't get that role. Come on, Joey. You're an actor, auditioning is what you do. And then his show, Mac And C.H.E.E.S.E. gets cancelled. Two TV losses in one day. Harsh. Meanwhile, Rachel is promoted at Ralph Lauren and gets to hire her own assistant. And she does what Rachel does best, be stupid. Instead of hired the fully qualified assistant, she hired the inexperienced good looking one, in hopes that the two could date. And Monica tricks Chandler into spilling a very funny secret about Ross.Overall, I give this episode a 10 out of 10.",1
8,Rachel has two candidates to be her assistant. She hires a handsome boy whose only experience is painting homes and working at TGIF's.Joey's Mac and Cheese show gets cancelled. Phoebe and Rachel rub their breasts up against him in response when he asks how is the show.,1
7,"Joey asks the Friends what they think about his new TV show, Mac and Cheese, that was finally aired. No one really liked the show, but they don't know what to say to him. Joey is also invited to come back to Days of Our Lives, where he will be Drake's evil twin sister, Stryker. The problem is that Joey needs to do an audition as everybody else and that bothers him a lot, since he already worked in the show.Rachel will be the new merchandising manager for Polo Retail, a job that Ralph Lauren himself offered to her. She is going to have a raise in her salary and can also hire an assistant. She makes a lot of interviews with different types of person, and a woman named Hilda is the most probable candidate to win the job, but she ends up hiring the beautiful Tag Jones. Tag doesn't have experience in the job, but he looks like a model, and for Rachel that's sufficient.Chandler tells Ross'Disneyland story to Monica in exchange of a gossip in Phoebe's work. When Monica is making Tacos for dinner, she starts laughing when Ross tells he cannot eat them yet. Ross discovers that Chandler told Monica about his story, and they all start to tell each other's secrets.",1
1,"I'm a lifelong Friends fan, and I get that it aired 20 years ago, but the fact that they made the ultimate embarrassment Chandler accidentally kissing a (trans?) guy, just REALLY rubbed me the wrong way. They brought it up several times as the one incident that trumped all the others, and I'm sorry, but it's not a big deal, and making it a huge deal is in poor taste and just offensive.I just couldn't believe Friends was so time deaf; although they never were really a friend to the LGBT community.",-1
10,Poor chandler kissed a dude and now everyone knows about it. The part where they are yelling secrets is so funny.,1
7,"The arc where Monica, Chandler and Ross expose one another's secrets is funny. Rachel and Tag story is more troubling. Hiring an assistant based on their looks is not funny. This may be Rachel's worst moment in the series.",1
5,"The edition is unnecessary long; then the effort to conclude all the parts in 10 minutes is so rapid... Main actor is not good, also, he does not fit in the roll. However, Takako Matsu plays her part very well; the changes in her expressions contribute a lot to the character. The script have potential but is too naive and simple. In real life is not possible, even less in Japan, for an ordinary man, to find all those opportunities with women. I mean; not only dating ones but to propose marriage or live the life together. -More than one time in this movie, and like in real life, there s the mention of beauty and how important is to develop a life; a life in the modern world.-there are all types of relationships in this world but in the end is very difficult to come out unhurt from the perverse emotions that relies in some minds. One point is that is better to not make any machination if there s love in a couple.",-1
4,"Four Rode Out is a European western to be sure not made in Italy so it does not rate being called a spaghetti western. It was made on the plains of Spain in the dry season as you'll see by the landscape. The same plains where the armies of Napoleon and Wellington rode back and forth upon.For a Spanish made production, three Americans were brought over to star in this essentially four person soap opera, Pernell Roberts late of Bonanza who plays a US Marshal on the trail of bandit Julian Mateos who has just robbed a bank where a guard was killed. Mateos not wanting to leave without a little nookie from girl friend Sue Lyon also accidentally kills her father in self defense when the old man caught Sue and Julian in the act. The third American is Leslie Nielsen, a really grungy character who is a Pinkerton man interested in recovering the money and the bounty on Mateos' head. He declares himself as accompanying Roberts on the hunt and Lyons follows them both to make sure her man is taken while he still has a pulse.Acting honors such as they are belong to Nielsen who turns out to be a far more loathsome character than even the viewer thinks when first meeting him. There's not much traditional western action after Mateos is taken alive no thanks to Nielsen. But on the way back the flaws come out in all the characters.Four Rode Out might have been better in American hands with folks who know what the western genre is all about. As it is it becomes more of a soap opera than a horse opera, not a recipe for western fans to like.",-1
5,"""Four Rode Out"" has one of those elements that I've seen in other Westerns, ""Cry Blood, Apache"" being one, where there's an entirely different type of terrain coming and going. I mean, where was that huge expanse of desert when Marshal Ross (Pernell Roberts), Brown (Leslie Nielsen) and Myra (Sue Lyon) first set out to capture renegade Nunez (Julian Mateos)? They rode out from and returned to the same little town, why didn't they just cover the same ground? Makes me crazy.Now I've read the other reviews on this board, and all of them describe Leslie Nielsen's character as a Pinkerton agent, so I have to wonder if I was the only one paying attention. There was a point at which Nunez fingered Brown as his ex-partner Krueger who was after the bundle they both stole from a bank with a third partner who was already knocked off by Krueger. So was Nunez trying to cause some confusion for Marshal Ross? I don't think so; Brown/Krueger was just a little too anxious to knock off his fellow travelers and high tail it with the money. His off screen rape of Myra was another hint that Krueger was a real bad apple.Now this all probably sounds a lot more interesting than the actual film. The picture uses up an awful lot of filler time with the party going up and down mountain terrain and dragging across the sun baked desert. Janis Ian's voice on a number of songs throughout lent some poignancy to the story, but quite honestly, I find her lyrics and style to be just too depressing most of the time.Just yesterday I watched ""China 9, Liberty 37"" on Encore Westerns in prime time, and was quite surprised to see a fully nude Jenny Agutter in a series of love scenes with Fabio Testi. So the idea that the word 'whore' was actually bleeped out of the dialog in this picture seems rather odd. But then again, there were a lot of odd things about this story. Too much sun will do that.",-1
3,"U.S. marshal Pernell Roberts is reluctantly joined by Pinkerton employee Leslie Nielsen in the search for a bank robber and possible murderer who has escaped to the Mexican desert; Sue Lyon, as the woman in love with the bandito, doesn't want him killed and makes the hunting party a trio. Low-budget Spanish production with American leads is technically inept--and far too low-keyed and solemn to make an impression--though it does have appropriately moody music from Janis Ian and interesting performances. Hirsute lawman Roberts manages to put some thought into his portrayal, while Nielsen (looking like Darrin McGavin) adds a little wily flavor. Lyon (still retaining the piercing bedroom eyes from her nymphet youth) struggles with an ill-conceived part, one which requires her to change from her cowgirl duds into a wedding dress in the sweltering heat. Director John Peyser probably intended this to be a psychological western, but he doesn't have the material nor the budget to expand on his deadly-serious ideas. The character conflicts which arise are clichéd, while the mercilessly elongated finale is ridiculously 'arty'. *1/2 from ****",-1
8,"Now, I've just finished watching this film, and the first point I'd like to make is that I've never seen Leslie Neilsen in anything better. As the film requires, he's sinister, leery, violent, childish, anxious and insane as Perkington agent Brown (or is he?)...I was glued to the screen from start to finish, which is unusual for a Western that has no real gunfights.Marshall Ross heads out to bring a Mexican bandit to trial. Problem is, the bandit's girlfriend wants to tag along, as does Brown, a Pinkerton agent who merely likes to kill his clients and bring them home. The girlfriend gets concerned that Brown will kill her boyfriend, but he makes her a deal: her body for her boyfriend's life...and so begins a game of intrigue.Four Rode Out basically has four characters in it. Leslie hates everyone, wants to kill everyone, and wants everything from himself. On the other hand, Marshall Ross just wants his last assignment over and wants to go home. Fernando just wants to live a little longer and Sue Lyon's character is a sadly misguided teen who believes everything she is told...The whole drama of the affair plays out in the desert as the characters have less water and less patience.If you are looking for something different, you will enjoy this one. It's low on action, but story wise I had to sit it out until the end.",1
2,"FOUR RODE OUT (1 outta 5 stars) Kind of a pathetic excuse for a western starring Pernell Roberts who gave up his role in TV's ""Bonanza"" to star in this... a movie which isn't even as good as an average episode of that classic series. Sue Lyon (mostly known for starring in Stanley Kubrick's ""Lolita"") plays the loyal girlfriend of a Mexican bandit (Julian Mateos) being hunted for the murder of her father. It wasn't really murder... the father killed himself after discovering that his daughter was sleeping around with a Mexican. Regardless, Pernell is determined to bring the bandit in for a fair trial. Leslie Nielsen also appears as a nasty Pinkerton agent with dollar signs in his eyes. Somehow they all wind up in the middle of the desert with little water and not much hope of making it back to the nearest town. Still, they find time for plenty of bickering, an impromptu wedding and even a strip show by the curvy Ms. Lyon. Looks like the kind of movie that could have been shot over a long weekend.",-1
8,"""Four Rode Out"" could have been titled, ""Four Walked Out,""since the quartet of characters spent most of their time on foot. The horses were done with one by one in scenes that looked almost too real.It is, to say the least, a very stark movie - slow-moving, yes, but constantly engrossing. The clown critics who gave it one star were probably affected by the hot desert sun coming through their screens, affecting their minds. Whoops - almost said brains.As to the acting. Young Mateos as the b.f. was convincing. Sue Lyon, accused by one critic as over-acting, was quite good handling a rather complex character, one almost as naive as Lolita. (Had to get that in).Leslie Neilsen sandwiched between his early near-fame days, to steering the Poseidon into near oblivion, to good-sized stardom, seemed to have a blast as a baddie - a real baddie.Pernell Roberts, Bonanza's maverick, was excellent portraying a very questionable character.The silent ending wrapped the story beautifully. The minus was Janis Ian's contribution - totally unnecessary, totally dull.The rest of the music was justifiably sparse. For a change, it did not blast out at you.All in all, ""Four Rode Out"" is worthwhile. Fie on the naysayers. Give it a chance. It is sometimes frighteningly captivating.",1
2,"About the only thing interesting in this early '70's western is the soundtrack. Composer and performer Janis Ian had a long, distinguished musical career, frequently working in Hollywood on both features and indie projects. Other than an obscure short, this 1971 feature was Ian's first effort. Ian provides not only several songs, but also the guitar work for all tbe incidental music. A great first effort in an otherwise forgetable movie. Parnell Roberts leads?",-1
6,"I kind of liked this slow-moving western, filmed in Spain's Almeria region. Technically this is a spaghetti western, a USA-Spain co-production, although only the location and one of the stars have any sort of Euro-Western pedigree. The music, by Janice Ian, is about as far from Ennio Morricone as you can get, although some of the banjo plunking is appropriate. Pernell Roberts is very good as the Marshal, after fugitive Julian Mateos (THE HELLBENDERS, RETURN OF THE SEVEN) who robbed a bank during which a teller was killed. Along for the ride are slimy Pinkerton man Brown played by Leslie Nielsen in a rare villainous role, and lovely Sue Lyon as Mateos' fiancé, who wants to see him brought in alive. They ride and ride, then ride some more, and finally pause for a brief action scene, then ride back the way they came, but now they're low on water. It takes patience to watch, but the actors keep our interest, and I was pleased by the ending. As half of a dollar DVD I felt my fifty cents was pretty well spent. Two puzzles though, all the listings for this flick say 1971 but the titles at the end claim 1968. I tend to believe the titles. Also, the version I saw bleeped the word whore when it was spoken, several times in the first few minutes. I wonder why?",1
7,"The movie is slow paced, but for the most part, flows smoothly. Anyone who has traveled the desert, on foot, will surely sympathize with the characters and feel right at home with the slow pace.I felt the problems were more with the indoor scenes, at the beginning, than in the later outdoor scenes. Much of the indoor filming is jerky and poorly framed. The scenes in the rooms had the camera in the actor's faces and should have been farther back, giving the actors the room needed to move around and express themselves. This would be easy on a sound stage, so I suspect the scenes were filmed in actual rooms, where space is limited.Likewise, the 60's music detracts from the film - dating it, when, if it had used a more traditional style of music, it could have been a timeless classic...The acting on the whole is good and the characters fill out as the movie progresses.There are a few annoying audio blips, as if some of the dialog was cut or bleeped.",1
5,"Interesting film with a strong cast. Pernell Roberts is outstanding and should have had more starring roles. It is slow paced but keeps the viewer's interest. Only a weak script keeps this from being more memorable. Following the success of the spaghetti westerns some American companies took advantage of the Spanish locations and used mostly American casts. ""Four Rode Out"" has the look of a spaghetti western while avoiding the badly dubbed dialog that hurt the genre. The primary print currently circulating appears to be from a television movie package so some words get bleeped out here and there. Fortunately it is not a choppy as many were.",-1
6,"I watched this completely unaware that the lead was also the writer/director/producer, having learned that info after definitely increased my appreciation for the film. It wasn't a perfect film, but it's obvious that there is a lot of potential in Zephyr Benson. His script wasn't perfect and his acting isn't exactly Oscar worthy, but it was the way the subject matter was captured that was really inspiring. He presented a common story of just how many of us can so quickly go from a life of immense potential and unlimited choices to a life of deep regret that's seemingly beyond redemption. All of which is usually resulting from a few small missteps at a very critical time in life, which here is in the later high school/mid to late teenage years.While this doesn't come across as a masterpiece, this debut does definitely warrant some extra appreciation due to the fact that it was all created by such a young filmmaker on what I'm sure was a very constraining budget. It more than succeeded in entertaining and does have a clear underlying message woven within making it worth a look.",1
10,"I thought this movie was great and extremely well produced especially considering it was written, directed and starred in my a kid who isn't old enough to yet be out of college. One needs to also take in consideration of how good this film is when it was produced with a very low budget in Hollywood terms. I also thought it had a great urban sound track. We should all go and support the young up and coming artists of today. This film should be shown annually to all high school students across America in hopes to keep them from this terrible fate.I think they would better identify with this culturally than they do to the current DARE programs that were/are in place.",1
10,"Straight Outta Tompkins is truly a historic film by a young talented filmmaker in the model of Scorese and DeNiro. This is a must see. Rarely does a film come along and puts the audience on notice Zephyr Benson sparkles on the screen as a writer, director and lead actor. A true cautionary tale that reminds us all about choices we must make in the journey of life. The Cast is spectacular, Aaron Costa- Ganis as Cruz, Cliff Bemis as the Headmaster, Jon Mccormick as Sam all give life changing performances. Filmed on a microscopic budget, the film production values rival those of multimillion dollar films. Sometimes lighting strikes and all the stars line up, this is that film. A MUST SEE!",1
10,"Yo. I dug this movie. But you either get it or you don't. If you don't know city kids, or drugs, you might not get the underlining story. I feel like I really understood what the writer was trying to say. It's a story you won't usually find on the big screen. I used to sell dope, and could relate to the story and see genes spiral to the bottom. I seen it too many times. family and friends. it ain't perfect, but the flaws make it even better. There are small moments that turn this movie from a normal drug movie, into a special little flick. If you know drugs, if you know that lifestyle, go see this film. You'll laugh at a few inside jokes. overall it was on POINT. props, son.",1

3,"This kid went to NYU too so I watched his movie last night and felt compelled to review it after seeing that it got a SEVENTY EIGHT PERCENT ON ROTTEN TOMATOES.Good news first yo.It definitely has some positive aspects. The camera was definitely expensive and the film includes some great shots of New York, especially during the opening montage, where the camera work was expertly done. In fact, if you took out the cheesy voice-over part, I'd say that the opening montage was the only part of this movie that I might call world-class. Great cinematography and production, especially given the budget, which was quite skimpy for a move filmed inside NYC. The hip hop soundtrack was fun though maybe a little bit poser-ish in context. Also, it is pretty hard to be bored during a drug/crime movie. At least it was entertaining.Now to the bad.The story was boiler plate, it seemed lifted from an archive of templates, generic. Who hasn't heard the heroin addiction thing a million times? Also, the whole premise of the movie, the family situation, the baseball scholarship, et cetera, seemed a little out of left field (yukyukyuk), meaning that it didn't make a whole lot of sense and made the movie feel forced and unconvincing. In general the plot was sort of a swing and a miss. There wasn't much of a genuine feeling at any point during the movie, it felt fake and it said nothing new.The periodic voice-over parts were Straight Outta Tompkins's fatal mistake. They actually made the movie pretty painful to watch at certain points. In the beginning Gene (the narrator) talks about how nobody but real New Yorkers know the real New York and ironically points out how he's more dangerous than the corner boys even though he's a privileged white boy. Yawn. The voice-over Gene also painstakingly narrates even simple aspects of the story which are totally unnecessary to explain. To put it shortly and free of spoilers, the voice-over is completely idiot proof which, to me, signifies an actor who is not talented (or perhaps practiced) enough to let his acting tell its own story. Sounds a bit harsh, but it's true. The production was good but the acting and writing were second or maybe even third rate to be completely honest. All-in-all I give this movie a C-minus, which in filmmaking is kind of worse than an F. At least an F has personality. Also, on a side note, it appears that the star/director/writer may have literally had his hand held by his parents throughout the entire production process, which is in ironic contrast to the plot of the movie where the main character is totally left to his own devices. Whoopi Goldberg pops in without credit for like two scenes. I wonder if she's a family friend... Anyway, this more entertaining than watching the Food Network or the news or something like that, so if you're supremely bored and want to experiment with something cringe-worthy, throw it on! It's pretty entertaining for a variety of reasons, not all of which are mean spirited.",-1
10,"Was trying to watch 'straight outta compton' and I saw this movie in the suggestions and was going to watch the first few mins and exit out of it. But! This movie is gripping and very intense, straight outta Tompkins is a beautifully crafted movie, I don't care about the 'camera effects' or anything like that, I'm more into the storyline and characters, which were outstanding, but they could have done without the horrible scene with the fake gun.
I will have to say, this movie is not for all audiences, you can only connect to this movie if you used to/still do drugs or are going through issues with family or friends. You can either LOVE or HATE this movie.",1
10,"Compelling true ghost story: a man remembers his experiences as a teen living in a real haunted house. Includes well-executed reenactments and consultation with a psychic, whose perspective on the tale adds to the spookiness.

7,"Madeleine Stowe is absolutely great in this show. And in this episode she truly is a force to behold. Victoria Grayson is a most complex character, and she does a wonderful job portraying the love of a mother who is looking out for not only herself, but for her children. All of what I have just said, would give entirely the wrong impression to the uninitiated not watching the show, She is like a black panther sitting there, a cornered black panther warding off an assault on her dignity, but still showing her affection for those that matter to her. The finer nuances, the inwardly groaning, the dismay in the eyes, a facial twitch here and there, weathering impending shame and scandal, it is all very vividly done.The strength of this show lies in showing the emotions of both sides. While Victoria is at times shown almost as a caricature Evil Queen up there in her balcony tower overlooking Casa Emily, thankfully she is not a cardboard character.Obviously characters are being written out as their story arcs come to an end. The other Amanda, and Ryan, the lawyer. Both are sure to return...? I don't quite see Amanda living up to what's expected, she's not the type.Ashley Madekwe has a relatively small part, but has enormous presence. And leggy Crista B. Allen running tearfully up the stairs towards the end, wow, baby!For all the other times I have posted backhanded compliments in previous reviews, this show lives up to its well-deserved reputation as a contemporary favorite.",1

When the boys lose their apartment to the wrecking ball, they find a place with Amy's help in her ladies-only Susan B. Anthony Hotel. Kip falls head over heels for Amy's roommate Sonny Lumet (Donna Dixon). The boys have to cross-dress as their fake sisters Buffy and Hildagar. In the second season, Kip reveals their secret identities to Ruth, Sonny and Isabelle Hammond (Telma Hopkins) who becomes the new manger of the hotel. The boys buy their own video production agency ""60 Seconds Street"" with Amy and help from Ruth.The gimmick allows the boys to cross-dress but it doesn't take full advantage of its comic potential. Hanks and Scolari have great chemistry. Wendie Jo Sperber is great fun as a third wheel option. Donna Dixon is gorgeous and charming. Her character is great in the first season but diminishes without the chase in the second season. Telma Hopkins doesn't get much interesting material and Holland Taylor is a good boss character. I think revealing their secret to each character could be great fun. Doing it all at the same time takes away some comedic possibilities. Isabelle should have uncovered the ruse early on. Sonny could have discovered it at the end of the first season as a cliffhanger. I like The Reunion and its after-school special message. Most of this show's best stuff comes from the fun duo's great chemistry.",1
8,"Sure, the storyline had been done before in ""Some Like it Hot"", but I really loved this show. The obvious reason for looking back on it now is to see Tom Hanks ""back in the day"" before he hit the big screen. After all, he was the only actor besides Spencer Tracy to ever win back-to-back Best Actor Oscars. Wouldn't you be curious if we had 40 or so half-hour episodes of Spence as a young man parading around in a dress in a situation comedy? I know I would. Besides Tom Hanks, the other cast members were terrific, and most had pretty good careers. Peter Scolari (Henry Desmond) had a long run on ""Newhart"" in the 80's, Donna Dixon (Sonny Lumet) was adequate enough as Hank's love interest on the show, the late Wendy Jo Sperber (Amy Cassidy) was very good as the overweight girl who hoped against hope that Scolari's character would come to love her, and finally there's the early appearance of Telma Hopkins (Isabelle Hammond) who had other comedic roles on ""Gimme A Break"" and then ""Family Matters"".It isn't until the second season that Sonny learns the truth about Buffy and Hildy actually being Kip and Henry, and the dynamics of the show pretty much change completely with Kip and Henry and their old boss starting their own ad agency. After a couple of seasons the show simply ran out of steam because there is only so much you can do with such a limited premise - much like Gilligan's Island.",1
7,"With the sad recent passing of Peter Scolari, I'm moved to write a review of this underrated sitcom. It was fun viewing, and we saw signs of Tom Hanks going on to bigger and huge things for sure. Peter Scolari moved on to Newhart, so at least he wasn't lost admist the Tom Hanks mania.I'd love to see a reboot of this series where the gender roles are reversed. Have two females as the leads. Also have an acclaimed British actor appear such as Danny Dyer.",1
6,"This film was about two guys who lived in a dive that ended up being condemned. The place's rent was dirt cheap and they apparently have a hard time finding something in its price range until they stumble upon an all female building and you guessed it, they dress like girls to move in and take advantage of its low rent. And as you can tell by my description it was a premise that could only go so far which is why the show only lasted 37 episodes and would likely be all but forgotten if not for the fact this show starred a young Tom Hanks before movie stardom. This is not to say it was a bad show, it was funny enough in parts, but it was just not built to last a very long time. The two guys dressing like girls worked for a few episodes, but you can only have so many episodes of everything built around the same joke. Near the end they had fewer episodes that did revolve around this and one of my favorite episodes had the two friends trapped in a cabin during a snow storm and they begin fighting over some creamer in the fridge, both fearing dehydration before foolishly realizing that they could melt the snow and have all the water they needed. Tom Hanks is good in this one and of course would become the mega star. Peter Scolari starred as the other friend and he would later go on to be a costar in the Bob Newhart show ""Newhart"" and appear in a few other television shows so while not having the same success he had a rather good run as well.",1
9,"It's been 37 years since this show first appeared and we were presented with the acting abilities of two young men beginning their careers. Peter Scolari would go on to more TV work in series like HONEY I SHRUNK THE KIDS and NEWHART. The other actor you may have heard of starring in more big screen movies. His name was Tom Hanks.BOSOM BUDDIES told the story of Kip Wilson (Hanks) and best friend Henry Desmond, two young men with dreams of making it as an artist and writer respectively, who work at an ad agency. When the building they're living in is demolished they look for somewhere else to stay. Agency secretary Amy (Wendie Jo Sperber), who openly longs for Henry, offers them a place for the weekend staying at her apartment. What she fails to mention is the fact that she lives in an all woman's apartment building. In an effort to ""skirt"" the regulations Kip and Henry borrow some ladies clothing from their workplace and waltz into the apartment complex as Buffy and Hildegard, sisters to Kip and Henry. When they realize how nice and affordable the place is they decide to make it more permanent and rent the room across the hall from Amy.Making the place all the more attractive is the fact that Amy's roommate is Sonny (Donna Dixon), a beautiful blonde that Kip immediately falls in love with. Of course this leads to all sorts of shenanigans as Kip tries to woo Sonny while his alter ego Buffy continues to tell Sonny all about how wonderful a catch her ""brother"" is.The series was successful enough to garner two full seasons and as a fan I never understood why it disappeared. Reading about it now it seems the ratings just weren't there for the show. Then again when you discover the same thing about a series like CHEERS it makes you wonder why TV executives don't to more to promote their shows and give them a bigger opportunity. The fact that the series has developed a bit of a cult following shows that it could have gone on longer.The biggest attraction of the series was the quirky nature of the comedy involved here. Hanks and Scolari play well off one another and it's easy to see, more so when you read about it, that there are many improvisational items in the series that made it one of the funniest things on TV at the time. Watching it all these years later it is still hilarious and enjoyable.But there is something else interesting to note here. There is no way possible this series could be made in now. The timing of this release, completely unintentional, rides on the coat tails of the #metoo movement and many items in the show would simply not fly in today's politically correct atmosphere. They are harmless and often revolve around the natural attraction between men and women. In fact much of the time when either Kip or Henry act like lecherous males it's to their detriment. And by living lives as women part time they discover the other side of the coin.One episode does a great job of looking at how men look at women as mere meat rather than as entire entities. A night out in drag they're looked over by the men at a local singles bar causing Henry to get angry that the men don't find them attractive enough to bother to ask them to dance. His outrage becomes vocal as Kip tries to remind him that their NOT women and that it's probably in their best interest not to have men attracted to them. Later on Henry realizes that while he was angry at the treatment he received he's been doing the same thing with Amy for some time.There are a number of jokes in the show that are hilarious and yet would cause the latest social warrior to demand a safe space to recover from being forced to listen to them. But the fact remains that comedy is supposed to make us uncomfortable at times, it's supposed to make us think and consider all there is around us. BOSOM BUDDIES did just that with each episode and made us laugh at the same time. It shows what is lacking in most comedies today, a sense of what is right without trying to shove it down your throat while watching. This more subtle approach unites rather than divides, never taking sides like many of today's comedies do. In the end it will make this the better series to remember and be enjoyed and will reach a larger audience.The single seasons have been released in the past but CBS Home Entertainment is releasing it now in the complete series format in a single box that will most likely take up less shelf space and keep it all together in one spot. If you've never seen the show then by all means pick this one up. You'll find yourself laughing start to finish and in addition to that get exposed to the crazy antics of Hanks in a very different light than seen in recent years. He's become such a great actor and while that's apparent here he's more inclined to remind you of Robin Williams than the star he is today. Pick up a copy and see why.",1
10,"This is where Tom Hanks' climb got started.Two men dress in drag so they can stay at an all women's hotel. Why? Their hotel was demolished, while they were in it.The drag angle gave this a boatload of sight gags to work with. Like when they were wearing wigs, bras, and shaving cream and singing 'Macho Man.' Hanks and Scolari made a GREAT duo. These two worked off each other perfectly.The late Wendi Jo Sperber and Thelma Hopkins provided great comedy on their own too. Sperber was better than she ever got credit for.Holland Taylor made a great foil for the humor. However, you almost wanted to like her.Donna Dixon was the looks. She was beautiful, and still is. I only wish her acting was better. But then, she still did well.This is one of those shows you wish lasted longer.",1
8,"This show, along with Three's Company and Happy Days, always bring back a great sense of nostalgia for me. It was a simpler time and while the shows back then could be a bit misogynistic, they were still fun. Bosom Buddies was one of those shows where it was fluff, but the actors were so adorable, you just couldn't help but like it.Tom Hanks and Peter Scolari had great chemistry. You could tell they really liked each other and made believable best friends. The late Wendi Jo Sperber always played the high energy best friend who was reliable and good for a laugh. Her passing was a sad day as she had a lot of fun characters on her resume (Bachelor Party and Back to the Future). The lovely Donna Dixon as Sonny made my 14-year old self stand up and take notice of the attraction of a woman. I used to love Tony Orlando and Dawn back then and seeing Telma Hopkin in one of her first roles was a treat. She was great in Gimme a Break and Family Matters. Holland Taylor has made a career out of playing the tough, but lovable female guru (Romancing the Stone, Two and a Half Men, etc). All these actors were still relatively unknowns, but would go on to better, if not bigger, things in later years.The gag ran out of steam after the first season, but it was still a ton of fun to watch. The way Kip used to snidely say Sonny's name over and over when he was trying to put something over on her, is something I still do today to people's names that end in the letter Y.",1
7,"These guys dressed up before it was cool and it was often hysterical. I have a feeling this show was a bit before its time. Great cast and top notch writing  made this one of the few comedy shows on TV that actually made you laugh out loud and was a real cut above most of the shows on back then.I dont know, maybe if it were done today, it may stay on longer but this went to rerun land much too soon. I have most of them on tape but would love them to be released on DVD someday. Hey, maybe they could even do Bosom Buddies: The Movie and Ton Hanks could direct. How about it?",1
4,"If you watch every episode of this show you will notice Tom Hanks auditioning for every roll he's ever played since, especially comedy. You get the goofy aloofness, the high talking outrage, the tender calm realizations, the generosity of sharing a bit of the spotlight it's all here.Two seasons was obviously enough in hindsight since we got all the movies, Scolari's awesome characters on Newhart and Girls to mention a few and of course Marty Mcfly's memorable older sister. And last but not least; Mrs. Evelyn Harper from Two and a Half Men.They all got better and higher quality since this show, surviving a very generic time in television history, that was the late 70's, early 80's.",-1
10,"How silly is this.... I sign up for IMDb because I love movies and my eye is drawn immediately to Bosom Buddies.... I adore this show. Prepsoterous and brilliant. It's probably a huge hit in England, right? Because the English love men in dresses --hee hee... But Tom Hanks is so hilarious in this and I think there is no better show that shows the potential of young actor. In retrospect one can see the tools of his trade being honed. I suppose a case could be made Robin Williams in Mork and Mindy, but wasn't he coked out his mind during the majority of the filming? Plus, I didn't really like the show all that much after season one. Peter Scolari was a great straight man for the show and I wonder what he's doing now. I may have to purchase my first DVD box set -- hee hee.",1
10,"Not only has Thomas Hanks played a woman, but he is an MTV Teen Choice Award winner!",1
5,"The moment I saw him, I knew Tom Hanks was gonna be a star. He had it. Whatever it is. And it exploded on the screen every week. The show was fluffy, silly and Hanks was a delight.",-1
9,"Recently, I caught an episode of Bosom Buddies. A couple of things jumped out at me. First, the show was genuinely funny. Silly, but funny. Second, I really enjoyed the chemistry between Tom Hanks and Peter Scolari. It's a shame that they didn't do more work together, aside from the small part in ""That Thing You Do"" and ""Polar Express"". I would like to see a movie where they truly co-starred in. It would be a nice bookend to their careers. (Not suggesting they are over.) The show wasn't exactly Seinfeld or Cheers, but the writing was solid and it holds up well. I know that there are only a limited number of episodes, but I would like to see this and other shows from the early 80's that seem to be hidden away.",1
10,"This sitcom has to be one of the missed favorites. It was definitely ahead of its time in its own way and only lasted 2 seasons. I so wish they would have made more than just 2 seasons. The opening song was perfect for the show and is still one of my favorites to this day. The chemistry between the characters were amazing especially those between Peter Scolari and Tom Hanks. And unlike Seinfeld (a show about nothing) this one always had a lesson behind their crazy antics. The next time someone knocks on your door, don't forget to ask ""Who Is It""?",1
5,"Elizabeth Montgomery as a real estate agent is robbed and shot while showing a house. She later spots the guy, Howard Rollins, at a fairground, where he's a volunteer mounted police officer. She reports him to the police, he's arrested and convicted, and is now serving a long sentence in Attica.It's hard to know how to assess this movie. Not because of the execution, which is routine, and not because of the acting. The principals -- Montgomery, Rollins, and Foxworth are fine. In fact Montgomery looks rather better than ""fine"" despite her age and impending terminal illness.It's that the movie seems to be self contradictory. It wants to assure us that justice has been carried out but what we are shown leaves us with too many doubts.It is all shown from the victim's point of view, which is okay in itself, except that we must realize that the living victim (this is based on a real incident) is liable to have a bit more weight when it comes to shaping the material than is the convicted black criminal who is now somebody's bitch upstate. We don't get to hear very much from Rollins.Could Montgomery have been mistaken when she just happened to spot Rollins astride his horse at the fair? Well, she is absolutely certain. But another woman who was a witness says that Rollins resembles the perpetrator, but ""on a scale of 10, he's a 7 or 8."" (How do you measure something like ""reasonable doubt""? What's the scale, and where's the threshold?) And why did Montgomery, having stumbled across the perp by accident and having immediately identified him to her own satisfaction, wait around until the next day to inform the police over a casual lunch about the event? The trial itself doesn't seem to resolve any of these issues. Montgomery identifies Rollins' voice through a closed door but that's a notoriously poor means of identification. Out of three speakers in the line up, she had one chance in three of guessing Rollins even if he'd been innocent. Rollins may or may not have had some connection with drugs. But he's well spoken and is a prosperous upright citizen. He runs a security business that protects dozens of shopping centers, he goes to church regularly, has a family (which we don't get to see), is a part-time volunteer policeman with a good military record, has never had any run-ins with the law, and spends time working for United Way or something. No physical evidence links Rollins to the crime. Why should a paragon of citizenship like this rob someone of a couple of thousand dollars and shoot people unnecessarily? On the other hand, why should someone in Elizabeth Montgomery's position lie? An interesting question, to which there are several reasonable replies. One is that she may not have been lying. After all a considerable time had passed since the crime. Maybe she was just mistaken.Another answer, far more conjectural, is that she was acting out a fantasy of victimhood. There seem to be two favorite human fantasies -- the conquering hero and the suffering victim. The former is mostly a male fantasy and the second a feminine one. I don't mean to sound in any way anti-feminist about this. A moment's thought will do to support the idea. Who watches The Action Movie Channel more -- men or women? And for which gender is Lifetime Movies for Women designed? I just watched ""With Murder in Mind"" on the Lifetime Movies channel. During one of the commercial breaks, an ad asked the audience, ""Who would you like to play YOU in a movie about YOUR life????"" (The informant's choice was Angelina Jolie. She'd be my choice too but it would be a different kind of movie.) In a way, this is a movie about the life of Elizabeth Montgomery's character's life and she plays the role of victim to the hilt. After her partial recovery from her wounds she becomes a demanding nervous wreck. She gets to drink too much. She doesn't have to work. She calls 911 every time a car pulls into the driveway. She makes a general nuisance of herself and at the same time gets people to feel sorry for her, which is having your cake and eating it too. Then she gets to be the central figure in a dramatic trial. She winds up seeing someone sent away for a long time based on her testimony and her moral authority as an innocent victim (which she undoubtedly was).And now there's even a MOVIE about her life -- and she is played by Elizabeth Montgomery! Now, all of that constitutes a lot of reward, which Freud dismissed too easily as unimportant ""secondary gains."" But Freud was a psychologist, not a sociologist, and he probably never saw a movie in his life. And he certainly never heard of Andy Warhol.I don't mean to say that the Montgomery character was a fraud, that she dreamed the whole thing up in order to become famous. Lots of times we do things without knowing the real reasons why we're doing them. But I do mean that although she was certain Rollins was the man, I wasn't convinced. And I suspect the writers and producers must have felt ambivalent about the justice of the conviction too, because they seem to hint that the whole case may have been a terrible mistake.Sometimes it's good to be the suffering victim. I think I might enjoy having a painless and not-disfiguring temporary illness so that a doctor could examine me and tell me, ""Spend the next three years in bed. And be sure to drink plenty of fluids.""",-1
6,"**SPOILERS** Even though based on a true story ""With Murder in Mind"" seems a bit strained in convincing it's audience that Samuel Carver aka Mr. Fermin was the one responsible for the shooting at the Slone house that left the owner Ted Slone and real-estate agent Gayle Wolfer clinging to their lives.We saw the crime happen on the screen and who the perpetrator was so there was no doubt that Samuel Carver did it but the way it was presented in the court-room at Carvar's trial it left so many doubts that it made the jury verdict of Carver being found guilty, where he got 29 to 75 years behind bars, a bit extreme at the least for a crime where nobody was murdered.Gayle's testimony is undoubtedly the clincher in Carver's conviction and there was no reason for her to lie, like we knew by watching the movie. But for the jury to believe her would mean that Carver was totally out of character, and out of the vicinity, when he committed the crime and not at all have it consider those facts in their verdict. Were also given testimony by one of Carver's employees' at his security firm Sara Bendix that he was with her bowling the night that the crime took place and even the cross-examination of Miss. Bendix by the state prosecutor couldn't shake her testimony by trying to trip her up on what color tie Carver wore at the time. Which should have given the jury some doubt in Carver's guilt but they still found him guilty on all counts.The star witness in the trial, after Mrs. Wolfer, turned out to be a sleazy illegal car chop owner Bennie Lazzara who admitted he was dealing with Ted Slone and that Ted owed him $90,000.00 in what seemed to be Lazzara steering his drug buying clients to him. Even though it was proved that both Ted and his girlfriend Susan were involved with the trafficking in illegal drugs Lazzara claimed he had nothing to do with it, so why did he have business with them. Lazzara was then given immunity from being prosecuted by the state for turning evidence against Carver which dropped the drug charges against him. Yet at the same time Lazzara was believed to have hired Carver to collect the money from Ted Slone but not to shoot like he did which Lazzara wasn't given immunity for.Carver were told was in serious debt in his security business and jumped at the chance, that Lazzara gave him, to grab the $90,000.00 that Ted Slone owed him and keep half for himself. Yet again why should the jury believe a sleaze like Lazarra over and upright citizen like Carver with Lazarra having a motive, immunity from prosecution, for testifying as he did.The way the trail was presented in the movie made Carver's conviction looked both unreal and unjust but the fact that we did see him commit the crime, which the jury didn't, showed that justice prevailed. Your left with the uneasy feeling that the very fact that the movie ""With Murder in Mind"" left no doubt at all in the mind of it's audience about who the criminal was, Samual Carver,is because the evidence that it was to present to show that he committed the crime was so full of holes. In fact the evidence would not at all have convinced those of us watching the movie like it did convince the jury who didn't!",1
10,"During my time working in Hollywood, this was the one made for television movie I worked on. I was the post-production supervisor. I had worked for Helios Productions with Brad Wigor and Joe Maurer several times on CBS Schoolbreak specials and they had asked me to take this job on, manning the office in Beverly Hills while they were on location in Atlanta where the film was shot. The film was edited entirely on film, only going to tape later from the finished print. The old film editing style was quickly being replaced by tape and computers so this was a thrill to work one last time on film.One of my memories from this film include being assigned to coordinate a meeting in New York between Howard Rollins and producer Brad Wigor. We really wanted Howard to take the part of the bad cop but he was not sure if he wanted to take it. I remember getting Howard on the phone on the day that he had learned of a close friends death. He was very upset. He talked and I listened for a good long while. I'll never forget his voice and the fear he had. In the end, the meeting was arranged and Howard took the part. He was an excellent actor and really turned in a fine performance in this film.I also cherish meeting both Ronny Cox and Elizabeth Montgomery during the ADR sessions. Ronny had just made an album in Nashville of country music. As a fellow musician, we talked about music and my planned relocation to Nashville. Ms. Montgomery was a class act. She arrived early for her session and she and I had a nice chat in the studio while we waited for the session to begin. I was thrilled to meet her and will never forget her interest and kindness.As a final footnote, this idea was brought to Helios by our production secretary Joannie Cuff. She had grown up in the Buffalo, NY area and knew of the story. Brad and Joe secured the rights and the movie was made. Joannie was given the well deserved title of Associate Producer for her efforts.Michael Killen",1
7,"I really can't judge fairly from 1-10 as this movie is about my mother, my family, my wedding at the end. For the people who may be feeling compassion for the man who committed this crime, shame on you. When movies are made ""based"" on true stories, there is no possible way that all the information can be portrayed in 100 minutes. This was a long drawn out process for my mother as well as our entire family. Technically there were no murders committed but the intent of the perpetrator was to leave these people dead. The movie portrays our family loosely but the actual events of the crime are accurate. Some may sense that there was not enough evidence to convict this man of this crime where we know otherwise. The paper trails that were tied to this man were undeniable including a multitude of phone records connecting him to my mother for a length of time prior to the crime setting up appointments to gain entrance into the home. I truly believe in the real world if someone is behind you with a gun pointed at your head and they are speaking to you that you would never forget that voice. It is that voice that my mother heard on that actual day at the Randy Travis concert at a local fair. When wondering why she waited until the next day to contact authorities (and it was not over a casual lunch), this man was a mounted policeman. I guess people need to realize that there is a lot of corruption in law enforcement which would make my mother leery of contacting police at that very moment. This man did have real life financial difficulties and burned down his own home d/t these financial reasons. Nothing is ever black and white and movies are just that MOVIES. They are there to tell a story but also for our entertainment. Yes this is 2011 and I am just commenting now as I came across this website by accident. Our family has since moved on but this tragedy is something that will stay with us forever. As far as the wedding scene at the end seeming like a fairy tale ending, it just happened that the man was convicted on the day of my rehearsal for my wedding. My mom never used this experience to become ""famous"", this opportunity was brought to her. Because of this experience, Realtors now use different techniques for safety which in the current world we live in is a good thing. As a side note, previous to this incident, my twin sister was abducted by two men after being lured to a cabin they said they had wanted to list. The man responsible for her kidnapping was also responsible for a murder in Colorado and my sister had to go there and testify. There are heinous crimes all around us and no one should judge the outcome or prison sentence until you have lived through it.",1
10,"I am actually trying to get a copy of this TV Movie as it was about my Vietnam bunk buddy Edward Beaufort-Cutner who is no serving 25-50 years in Livingston Correctional Facility in NY. Oddly, he committed the crime in 1988, when I was a prison warden in Nebraska. I have been trying to find him for 40 years and just did so yesterday. I am calling the prison today to see if I can contact him. I am a writer and may want to do the rest of the story into a feature film. What is also odd is he was denied parole for his initial hearing May 12, 2014, which is my birthday. We both got out of the military and finished criminal justice studies and ended up running private security and investigation companies.I finally found a copy of this movie available on-line for a mere $8.49 and will be able to watch it next week to start researching ""the rest of this story.""After carefully watching this movie with my wife this week (2-10-16), I believe there is ""the rest of the story"" to be told here. I have been corresponding with the convicted perpetrator to this crime, along with his family, for the purpose of reconnecting 50+ years from Vietnam, and looking for ways he can get a fair parole hearing. I realize there was considerable circumstantial evidence that was pieced together to convict him, but the act is totally out of character for him. Although all his parole success prediction factors are good-excellent (age, prior criminal history,attitudes, prison conduct record and program participation, education, family support employ-ability, soundness of parole plan, etc.), his main obstacle of the court record and movie rendition of the execution-style intentional murder attempts and the vicious image those shootings represent in the jury's and parole board's mind. They may think he needs to serve 36 of the 50 years which would put him at 82 years old. While Sirhan-Sirhan and Charlie Manson should never be released, it is probably time for Eddie Beaufort.",1

4,"This is the first Dragon Ball movie and it is probably also the shortest at only 41 minutes. The main antagonist in this film from over 25 years ago is Garlic Jr., the son of another antagonist that got killed by Goku before this film in the series I assume. I am not familiar with the series, so I cannot comment any further in detail about that reference, but I can say that I was fairly underwhelmed by this movie here. Then again I may be a bit biased because anime was never a preferred choice of mine and I actually prefer very old cartoons or animation Pixar style. So yeah, with that in mind ""Dead Zone"" didn't do too much for me really. It's still not an entirely bad film by any means, but I felt the story was just stretched for way too long given that they already fight the antagonist halfway into the movie and it's pretty generic too. As always, it looks like they have no chance and then in the end they manage to win anyway. Oh yeah, the mission here is to get Goku's son back who was abducted by the vengeful other son I mentioned earlier. To make this somewhat funny they included scenes of where Goku's son is a nuisance to his kidnapper. Still, it wasn't exactly comedy gold I have to say. All in all, I cannot recommend this.",-1

7,"This is the first movie with the ""Dragonball Z"" title on it. There were in fact some before this, but they had the original ""Dragonball"" series names on it. It's weird how this is actually shorter than some of the specials! I still consider it a feature length movie. If so, it might be the shortest one I've ever seen. It makes no sense with the show, even though it should with the filler of the Garlic Jr. saga. There's no reason why Krillin would be surprised Goku has a son in the first episode or why everyone is surprised when Gohan unleashes his power on Radditz as those things happened here.With all that being said, I still enjoyed it, but wouldn't quite recommend it. The scenes where Gohan gets drunk is some of the funniest stuff the series has ever done! I love the idea of taking Emperor Pilaf's voice and giving it to a serious villain. I don't know if I ever realized that Ox King is Gohan's grandfather before. There's so many characters it's hard to keep up with how they're related! The animation is good too. ***",1

Contains the same opening as the long running TV series. While the the whole thing felt like a two parter episode than a movie. Of course anything shorter than an hour always seems that way. It was the same with the first 3 Dragon Ball Movies. Ignoring that, this feature film is worth watching. I imagine the Kami/Piccolo fans to enjoy this because the play a part in it.Available to own on DVD as well as the other 12 full length features.",1
9,"DBZ: The Dead Zone film is one of the very rare things I ever like and still like about DBZ, it's original, it has an original story, the action is overall intense and fun to watch, the voice acting (the original voices) are good and the music (once again the original soundtrack) is excellent to listen too. So let's get deeper into the review.This is my own opinion, i respect yours. First off, I grew up with this crap in my childhood and yes i loved it. Going back and watching most of it now, I dislike half of it. I only love this. I do not mind the Sayin and Namik sagas as they are fun to watch and they have goo plot lines. The other DBZ films are medicorish and that's where i love this one most because the story was new, the characters were new and everything. When we got the Android/Cell and Buu Sagas and even DBGT, it felt like a replay, where everything was just been played like a broken record all over again. I also loved the Garli Jr. Saga.Now back to the film....I think the characters are very original and they are developed quickly. The story doesn't waste time into presenting into what it want to presents and show and the action mentioned above is freakin awesome. I also love Garlic Jr. Great character. The visual effects for a 1989 animation was good. If you love combat films this definitely one for the books in my collection. I own the original version in English and I got an Italian version when I was little :P.As far as DBZ stuff goes (episodes and films) avoid most of it, but this should have Ur attention straight away :D.8.5/10",1
9,"More a long episode than anything else, Dead Zone is actually the beginning of the Dragonball Z series.  Fans of the series who find themselves confused by the plot would do well to watch this (and the next view episodes) if they can find it.  It establishes the fact that Goku and Piccolo, two of the show's most important characters, were once enemies, a fact that greatly affects later plot elements but is only occasionally referenced once the series gets underway.  Of course, like the rest of the series, Dead Zone is light on substance and heavy on fight sequences, but that's what makes the show fun to watch, anyway.  9/10",1
4,"That's all I can really say about this film.  It's DBZ...like Tree of Might and The World's Strongest, it really...doesn't fit into the timeline for the show at all, though it is supposedly placed just before the beginning of the TV series.  The action is pretty nice in general.  The plot has a nice enough base, with a good background establishing why these guys hate each other and all.  Pretty good in general, there... The problem is...there's a lot of really weird stuff.  I mean, really weird stuff.  Like The World's Strongest, there's a really, really odd song in this one that could only have been created in a drug induced haze...disturbing is the fact that Gohan, while singing, is pretty much drugged out himself.  Creepy. The villains are odd and rather comical...moreso than the usual DBZ type--this seems more like it was made as a Dragon Ball movie rather than a Dragon Ball Z movie.  In general, its entertaining enough, but...just...strange.",-1
6,"Some of the Dragon Ball Z movies were great but confusing. The movies are only mentioned once in the series, otherwise, they never happened in the show. This is one that happened. Garlic Jr. The second worse villain in DBZ history next to Android 17. The movie was pretty good but with a different villain and not this stupid Dead Zone thing, it might of been a pretty good retelling of Gohan's first burst of power. Honestly I'm not a big fan of the early films because I don't like the voices and the villains don't reflect with anything from the TV series. One, two, and three all have their own, new but sad villains. Meanwhile the rest have some villain that have something to do with the show like Frieza's brother Cooler.",1
7,"The very first DBZ movie, although I like The Worlds Strongest better than this one, This movie still holds up pretty close to The Worlds Strongest, It has great fight scenes and smooth animation. The story of this one is pretty good, The movie is very funny as well, such as Gohan peeing on Krillins head! and Gohans drunken dream! and this scene is not weird, and the animators were not on drugs, You people are on drugs. Think about it Gohan is clearly drunk or high whatever and that is why he is seeing all this weird stuff. And yes the sound effects are great. The reason I think ""The World Strongest"" is the better movie it would have to be because there are more longer fight scenes in ""The Worlds Strongest""",1
9,"First let me say that compared to the other Dragonball Z movies, Dead Zone is the only one which can possibly fit in with the timeline set by the episodes.  It takes place before the series, and thus runs no risk of contradicting anything.  Although the translations of Japanese animation into English is usually poor, I found the character of Goku to be, as always, the perfect combination of super hero and down to earth dad. Gohan's hidden power, which even Goku is unaware of at this time, is amazing, and he is definitely his father's son in the way that it comes out when his friends and loved ones are suffering.  A must see for DBZ fans.",1
5,"This movie didn't do so well with me. It had it's moments. Such as the weapon fighting between Goku, Nicky and Ginger but the plot was all to familiar ie: Vegeta. Points of the movie seemed odd also. Such as Kami saying Piccolo had been killed by Goku, yet Kami showed barley any signs of dying himself. Also being so mentally connected he would never make the mistake of thinking Piccolo was dead when by all means he wasn't. Also Garlic Jr. informing his crew that he intended to keep Gohan as a disciple seemed lamely put, as he showed no signs of even bothering to entertain the boy. There was barley any background to the movie, it was just start to finish.I did like Goku's new persona though, rather cocky. It was a nice change. As for original characters I didn't find anything interesting (except that Nicky and Ginger pulled swords from their limbs!) They were all stupid and with very annoying voices. Give the bad guys voices that suit for once! Also why would three strong warriors (Sancho, Nicky and Ginger)follow the leadership of Garlic Jr, he wasn't smart, strong, or even witty! It just seemed to me that the characters in this film (all characters) were running around like headless chickens. Yet it was the 1st dbz film so obviously this was a training ground for all the rest.",-1
6,"A pretty good prequel to the Dragon Ball Z Series overall. The major downfall of this film is the scripts for the voice actors. Everything they say seems rushed to make sure it fills in with the mouth movements of the characters. The voices are also fairly emotionless, ""Just another day on the job"" kinda deal.The fighting sequences are what you can expect from Dragon Ball, fast paced and entertaining, but ultimately end anti-climactic and rather quickly. The ending of this fight also doesn't fit very well with the show's timline, the example I can think of off the top of my head being the fact that Gohan's burst of power that pushes Garlic Jr. into the Dead Zone is never mentioned during the Vegeta Saga of the show where none of the shows characters appear to know how strong Gohan really is.The film does have some good points though, the main one being that it is entertaining enough to watch for 40 minutes or so without getting bored.",1
6,"This is the third version I watched ... and I heard there will be a Hollywood version as well. So there we go. I can't imagine it getting better than the spanish original. But I would say that the other versions do have certain things that work - not just locally. The police thing was better handled in the German version, the family and father interaction is a bit better in this Korean version.But as you can imagine and as I already sort of stated, stick with the original movie if you can - and if you either speak spanish or do not have issues with subtitles. All in all this is decent, but I've seen better thrillers from Korea. Technically you cannot fault it at all - and the actors do their best too.",1
6,"This is a remake of a 2015 Spanish film, which will also soon be remade in Hollywood with Liam Neeson at the helm. The premise is exciting -- combining elements of Keanu Reeves in ""Speed"" and Colin Farrell in ""Phone Booth"". Hostages, Bombs, Car Chases... It's all fast-paced and well produced. My one quibble was the final outcome. I wish they had been a little braver in the final ten minutes.",1
7,Slightly flawed but engaging South Korean thriller. Kim Chang-ju made noteworthy directorial debut though at times kinda forced higher stake by strange character's decisions. There's big moral message about doing right thing and paying for sins which Jo Woo-jin managed to do. Lee Jae-in also performed well in the backseat.,1
10,"Great movie, especially if you're into South Korean cinema. The acting from the two kids and the father was amazing, great acting from all three. My only hate in this movie was that horrible grating droll swarmy background music that annoyed me throughout but i still give the movie a 10/10. Well worth a watch and will recommend this to family and friends.",1
6,"Definitely has some flaws. Everything is not perfect like the police's actions. However, the film is intense. From the first minute to the end, the movie is really fast pace. The 90 so minutes will pass super fast. There are a couple slow moments in the middle of the movie but this is to introduce the villain. Overall, great to watch.",1
10,What a film. Speechless. Thrill till the end.one of the best film.,1
6,"It's an enjoyable movie. There is nothing wrong technically speaking...Some things were kind of lazy; like how the police handled things and the rushed but weird editing and ending of the last 15 minutes of the film.The acting is very great storywise not so much and you shouldn't expect a great bomb thriller story since I think this is a remake I've seen before years ago.So what's wrong? At the end of the film certain editing choices doesn't make logical sense compared to the rest of this film. It feels like the director or the editor just wanted to finish the film due to a (personal) deadline or made a mistake during story boarding and not shooting scenes to connect it with the general flow and editing of the film.As for the back story of the villain; uhmm...yeah? I guess where he is coming from but there doesn't seem to be any real justice and the film just made me feel I've been used as an old chewing gum.Even though it is selling well/streaming well in South - Korea the general score it has gotten there by around 1 million viewers is around 5.3 as I write this, which in my opinion is an accurate representation if you look past the great acting, which is like a 9/10! If you are only interested cos you want to learn acting or just so you can talk about it cos all of your friends watched it; then sure watch this...otherwise? Mweh... Watch a different film if you can instead.",1
7,"The main character in ""Hard Hit"" is taking the kids to school one morning - a boy and a girl - when he gets a restricted call. The unknown caller informs him that a bomb has been placed under his seat. It will explode if he leaves the car.This is all you need for 90+ minutes of frantic action, I guess, and the unknown caller soon supplies a demand and an explosive argument for making our hero do just like Toto. That is hold the line.The reliable supporting actor Jo Woo-jin tackles his first lead role playing an ordinary bank employee who gets pinned behind the wheel. His rapport with Lee Jae-in, playing his daughter, provides a human element in all the frenzy. He's understandably desperate. I mean, I would be too, if I had to handle at least two phone calls simultaneously while at the same time calm the kids down and actually drive the car.It's a saddening reminder of COVID-era realities, by the way, to see beaches and intercity highways in Busan all but deserted with no CGI enhancements needed.The movie is a remake of an excellent Spanish thriller, ""El Desconocido"" (2015), starring Luis Tosar in one of his best roles. The Korean version follows the original unusually closely, to such an extent that all they've really done is to translate it to the Korean idiom. And both movies surely owe something to ""Speed"" (1994) and Dennis Hopper's scheme as the bad guy.Anyway. The movie keeps the pace up, and it never feels as if the entire plot actually takes place inside or in the immediate vicinity of the hero's car. The unknown caller is online most of the time (those familiar to K-movies and K-dramas will undoubtedly recognize the voice right away), and the Koreans do love their phones and gadgets.The flow may get a little lost with subtitles, I imagine, but this movie worked for me, built around its ingenious plot. So fasten the seatbelt. Or then again, thinking of the unfortunate hero, maybe better not.PS: The Korean title refers to a ""Restricted Call"" as opposed to the meaningless English title, and in everday slang, it's also known as a ""black call"". Shouldn't miss a chance to show off...",1
10,"A family in car with bomb planted under seats threatens to blow off if his demands wont get fulfilled on time. Hope you understand the plot of movie. Taking, screenplay, acting is top notch as usual we expect from korean thrillers. Few scenes are absolutely terrific with good story plot. Worth the time you spend with no regrets for sure. Enjoy!",1
7,It's a Korean movie that talks about a guy get in his with his 2 kids and he found a phone in his car a phone call for a guy saying that there is a bomb and sending him photo for a bomb it's movie with a nice character with an good type of action I give it 74/100.,1
1,"First of all I'd like to say that I love South Korean movies. I saw the devil, Oldboy, The Wailing are some of my favorite movies overall. If I start to list every Korean movie that I like I'm afraid I won't finish until next week.But this, this was such a waste of time. Unfortunately just like some recent Korean movies. It's like authors take movie fans for complete fools. For example the episode where they were ""checking"" the dudes ""brothers"" identity?) Wut? The so called ""villain"" didn't have any relation to the main character and was still allowed to pass by the police?! Overall the storyline is too simple and very predictable. It almost seems like after Parasites won the Academy Award, Korean movie makers decided that they have to start making ""American"" movies. That's exactly the opposite of what Parasites did to win the Oscars. Don't get me wrong I love American movies, best in the world. But I'm talking about old American classics not modern American movies which are all ideological clones of each other and movies like this one.P. S. The movie didn't clarify too well the financial fraud which the main character was a part of, but I want to say that everyone is responsible for their financial decisions personally. Don't blame banks or other individuals if you can't operate your own finances properly. So inconclusion the message of this movie is not good as well.",-1
2,"I so much wanted to like this film. From what the DVD box said, it seemed like a great idea for a movie--the troubles a fat girl goes through when she has an older, very attractive sister who seemingly ""has it all"". However, that was not the message I took from the movie. It was more along the lines of ""life stinks--then you get raped or die"". Oh I hated this movie and I have contempt for those who created it.So why did I hate it other that the fact that the theme really was not what I had expected? First, the movie is VERY sexually graphic and the nudity portrayed involved girls who appeared between the ages of 12 and 15 or so. Because of this, I doubt it would even be legal to make this film in many countries--especially when the 12 year-old is raped on film! I am truly worried that a pedophile might become very aroused watching the movie.Second, the exact purpose and theme of the movie is completely ambiguous. Every time I thought the movie was trying to make a point, the plot completely changed directions and the meaning was obscured. I know for those ""in the know"", the point of such films IS the pointlessness. Okay, fine, I get it....but so what?!Third, the ending was sick and meaningless and seemed 100% random. COMPLETELY out of the blue, the mother and older daughter are brutally murdered on camera while they are resting in their car at a rest stop (the older daughter having her head bashed in with a hatchet and the mother was strangled). THEN, the 12 year-old is graphically raped on camera as well. It was like watching a ""snuff film"" and I cannot recommend this film to anyone.It was even more disturbing when I read the notes inside the Criterion DVD case. Apparently the young girl who played the ""Fat Girl"" (Anaïs Reboux) was not told that was going to be the international title for the film (in France it was titled ""À ma soeur!""). That, combined with the rape scene--I'd hate to have to pay that girl's therapy bills when she gets older!The only reason the film gets a 2 was because the film was TECHNICALLY well-made. While a technically horrible film like PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE or THEY SAVED HITLER'S BRAIN are clearly scored a 1 on the IMDb, I would MUCH rather view them. Although these two films are a mess and the acting is poor, at least they weren't patently offensive or exploitative or make me feel dirty for having watched them. Do NOT watch this film and do not believe any of the positive hype you've heard about the movie.",-1
3,"Anaïs Reboux watches -- and eats constantly -- as her sister, Roxane Mesquida, is seduced into sodomy and giving up her virginity by whiny Libero De Rienzo in Catherine Breillat's film which offers the startling observation that teen-age boys will do anything to get pretty girls to give it up.It's a study in the bad habits, whininess, violence and stupidity of humanity, presented as a series of anecdotes in which various self-involved individual encounter each other. Intended to make viewers ashamed to be human beings.",-1
3,"This French film is one that used to appear in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, then I read a review for it, it was only rated two stars out of five, so I had to see if it was really one that deserved its former place. Basically it is about the rivalry between two sisters, beautiful and flirtatious 15-year-old Elena Pingot (Roxane Mesquida), and less confident Anaïs (Anaïs Reboux) who is constantly eating. The two are on holiday with their parents, they are bored of staying in their vacation home at the seaside, so they explore town together. Elena is attractive and promiscuous, but she is saving herself who loves her, while chubby and overweight Anaïs is happy to lose her virginity to anybody. They meet an Italian law student, Fernando (Libero De Rienzo), at a café, he later sneaks into the girls' bedroom to be with Elena, but she backs out at the last minute, she refuses his advances, but ""consents"" to anal sex as a ""proof of love"". The next morning, Fernando approaches Anaïs, who listened to their entire interaction, she refuses his request for oral sex, she has had enough and wants to get some sleep. The next day, the girls and Fernando go to the beach, while Elena and Fernando go off alone together, Anaïs sits in the ocean in her new dress and sings to herself. Later the girls reminisce about their childhood, and Elena reveals Fernando gave her a mauve opal engagement ring at the beach. That night, Elena gives up her virginity to Fernando as Anaïs cries on the other side of the room. Later, Fernando's mother arrives at the rented house, this is when the girls' mother discovers Elena's and Fernando's relationship, and angrily decides to drive back to Paris. On the way they stop at a rest stop, there an axe murderer arrives, killing Elena with an axe and strangling the mother. The murderer takes Anaïs into the woods and rapes her, the police arrive the next morning, but the young girl insists she was not raped. It is a rather simplistic story of two young women in pubescence exploring their sexuality, the fat girl of the title is the most desperate for attention and doesn't care how it happens, the problem I have with this film is the pace is iffy, the action is slow, and besides the sexual stuff and unexpected ending, it is almost boring, only a mildly interesting drama. Adequate!",-1
1,"Catherine Breillat, the director of this film, knows how to provoke an audience with her risky themes. ""A ma soeur"" is a more disturbing film than the other director's movies, which we have enjoyed. Miss Breillat presents us an overweight teen ager who shows signs of low self esteem. To make matters worse, her sister, who is an attractive and slim girl, shows a cruel strain toward her sibling.We find the two sisters during a summer vacation. The two girls are so different that logically, we feel bad for the poor fat sister, who obviously, is at a disadvantage. The pretty sister has no problems attracting boys; she has no problems taking the one she likes to bed, while her sister listens to all what's going on in the room. This is cruelty beyond imagination.Miss Breillat shows courage in presenting this thorny account about sexual awakening. The only thing that feels out of place is the long sequence at the end of the film, which comes out of nowhere and leaves the audience stunned, as proved by the people that flocked to read the review posted on the lobby of the Lincoln Plaza cinemas, as many viewers obviously had trouble understanding the film.Those last minutes of the film seem endless and proved nothing more than perhaps a director who ran out of ideas and didn't know where to take the story, therefore the ending that will disappoint even those avid Breillat's fans.",-1
4,"(CONTAINS SPOILERS-The ending is discussed) Another stunningly strange film from Catherine Breillat, director of Romance, Anatomy of Hell and Real Young Girl.The plot concerns two sisters the older one, Elena who is about 14 or 15, and is thin and beautiful, and the younger,Anais, who is 12, is fat. While on vacation they meet a law student and Elena begins a dangerous flirtation with the young man. This quickly leads to several secret night time visits to the girls room as Anais watches her sister and her paramour. Tension grows between the girls as Anais longs for the affection that her sister is getting.I should state I'm not a fan of Catherine Breillat. I find her films shocking and silly. Clearly she's going for an effect, which she usually achieves, and which is usually dissipated by the the lack of anything behind it (to paraphrase some one famous she presents the obvious by way of the scandalous). Here for example we have several scenes of intimacy between Elena and her beau, which are filmed in long almost painful takes that simulate Anais watching from across the room. The scenes are edgy for what they are showing and uncomfortable since the girl involved is 14 or 15. (Anais is suppose to be 12. Though both seem older.) For me the scenes went from intriguing to uncomfortable to dull rather quickly as they seemed to just drag on. To me the scenes would have worked better had we gotten to know the two girls more at the start. Certainly a later scene where the pair shows affection for each other adds a great deal the relationship between the pair, but for me it was too late to affect the early sex scenes. Breillat also goes for effect when she has the mother drive the girls home and we have what seems like a two hour ride with the three women in the car moving in and out of traffic. Its grand foreshadowing and she builds tension for an event that never comes while at the same time keeping you sleepy enough that when the final bit comes you're completely unprepared.I have to tell you what that was but nothing that happens in the preceding 80 minutes prepared me for the unintentionally funny conclusion of this film. Many people find the sudden and shocking turn of events horrify and unnerving and the very end is, however what sparks that is simply very silly, and it was so out of left field, so bizarre, so ridiculous that the boredom of the long car sequence was sent packing as I doubled over in a fit of laughter. I can not and could not believe that anyone would do what Breillat does. Its a shock technique that doesn't belong in this film or a film like this which no doubt why so many people are horrified by it. Even if this were the sort of film that it might belong in, no one would do it as silly as here. What bothers me is that it leads up to a disturbing event that, and we should be really shocked and rattled to our core but for me it was wildly undercut in its power because what it took to get us there was so contrived and so ludicrous it runs the final bit.I don't know what deeper meaning was behind it all, certainly the rivalry between sisters and sexual longing and such,but I got no hidden truth, nothing I didn't know before. I'm sure it has something with Anais' statements about sex, then again it could be the most forceful statement of what many consider a slasher films morality, namely sex is bad. To be honest I had my cage rattled a bit, but to what end? Perhaps had I been a girl with a sister or two this might have meant something to me, but as it stands now its a dullish movie with a WTF ending.I'd leave this review there except I have to say something about the best thing in this film, namely the two girls the story revolves around. They are both stunning beautiful and damn fine actresses. The interplay between them is very real and I would love to see them paired up again, in a better film. To be honest they are so good that I will probably watch this again to see them interact (especially in the secrets scene) 4 out of 10 (I was tempted to say 5 out of ten but the ending really strikes me as too silly- a great moment-but for all the wrong reasons. I think the end is what sealed this films doom)",-1
7,". . . upon the Planet, and must be eradicated at all costs, FAT GIRL argues. Take the crime family pictured here. Mom litters out her car window, and weaves all over the highway. Big sister Elena runs a jewel theft con game, seducing foreign traveling gents and stealing their family jewels (doubtless giving them dire cases of V. Dee in the process). Little sis Anais is less discriminating than a starving canine, wolfing down any fatty food within reach of her pudgy paws. All the edibles spotlit here seem to be cold processed imitation grub, lacking even the warmth and nutritional value of a so-called ""French fry."" These low-life pikers trying to pose as people are not worth saving. Rather, the best, most merciful course of action involves axes to faces, garrots to necks and swords to scabbards, FAT GIRL suggests.",1
9,"Anaïs (Anaïs Reboux in her only acting role as of 2013) is the titular character in Catherine Breillat's Fat Girl (""À ma soeur!"" being its original French title). A chubby twelve year old girl, who finds herself constantly browbeaten by her fifteen year old sister, Elena (Roxane Mesquida) while they are vacationing with their parents off the coast of France. Elena, unlike her sister, is thin, incredibly gorgeous, and possesses a beautiful body. A topic of discussion between the two young girls as they listlessly walk around the resort is their virginity and their relationships. Elena, while sexually promiscuous, holds the belief that your virginity should be taken by someone you love. Her younger sister, however, believes that you should your first time should happen just to happen and you should just get it over with.While walking, they meet a law student named Fernando (Libero De Rienzo), who immediately finds himself attracted to Elena. Not long after meeting him does Elena invite Fernando up to her room to talk. Fernando believes like Elena does - that sex should be something sacred and special - but he winds up convincing her to partake in anal sex instead, as vaginal sex is something that judges whether or not you still have your virginity.While it is questionable that Fernando actually believes what he is saying, we can see Elena's hesitation during the foreplay and the sex. We are well aware of her beliefs at this point in time, however, we can see that she has a common curiosity about sex so much so that she simply wants to see just how the act is performed and executed.This scene is one lengthy, naturalistic shot Breillat conducts in the room shared by Elena and Anaïs, boldly establishing real-time, mood, and discomfort just by the way the shot is framed, how long it lasts, and how the characters are placed inside the shot. Fernando and Elena are spooning, with Elena's nightgown on and her vagina and pubic hair clearly visible to the audience. Fernando continues to rub her stomach in a way that doesn't change Elena's blank, frustrated, and confused expression. She knows what she's doing is wrong but is overcome by understandable adolescent curiosity. Anaïs is laying in bed several feet away, closing her eyes and pretending her sister's innocence isn't being taken away in front of her.Fat Girl works well because it illustrates the sexual tendencies of the female and a believable sibling rivalry that is captured with surprising purity and tenderness. When Anaïs and Elena fight, it's nothing but believable. When the two talk quietly in bed it is also believable, almost as if they are real-life sisters. This is because Reboux and Mesquida are not only great screen presences but evoke relatable chemistry as young girls. This chemistry is what the entire film rests on, due to the fact that parents' roles are predicated off of disinterest and ignorance, leaving the girls to utilize each other for companionship and advice.It's a tough subject and Breillat doesn't sugarcoat it. Either she lived a grim reality similar to her characters or she has seen friends go through circumstances akin to Anaïs's and Elena's. Or perhaps she has her head inside a teenage girls' head. Perhaps she just has a deep resonance and an awareness to the sexual maturity of adolescent girls. If that's the case, it would be tough to communicate such a resonance, but Breillat finds ways to do so in Fat Girl that make the film an unsettling and often very consuming piece of work.Much has been made about the ending that is admittedly out of nowhere, able to shock the most hardened viewer raw because of its jolting nature, and implied to add ambiguity and an additional layer to the story. After several hours, where it has crossed my mind about every five minutes, I have not made up my mind on it. An amendment to the review will be made if I do. Perhaps it's a rare moment when an instance in a very great film happens that I'll never be able to define. Did I like it? Did I loathe it? Is it out of place? Does it derail the story? No matter the answer to the question, the previous seventy-nine minutes were still disturbing and well worth seeing.Starring: Anaïs Reboux, Roxane Mesquida, Libero De Rienzo, and Arsinée Khanjian. Directed by: Catherine Breillat.",1
8,"The French flick ""Fat Girl"" looks at a semi functional family of four on hiatus at a beach home as their attractive 15 year old daughter experiences deflowering while her 13 year old sister, the fat girl, watches with mixed emotions from afar. The film focuses on the pair of sibs and the plight of the less attractive sib who has to cope with the myriad of emotions which go with the unhappy lack of parity life has dealt her. A very well crafted darkish drama, ""Fat Girl"" accomplishes its provocateur ambition with a bold statement near the end of the film. If reasonably engaged by the one hour mark, the viewer will likely not want to miss the conclusion which punctuates the body of the film. Excellent stuff for those into coming of sexual age films with psycho dramatic elements. (B+)",1
4,"What an unpleasant film this turned out to be. To start with, I hate the (ok, English) title in light of the film not exploring the issues around body image for a young woman in any meaningful way, and I hate the stereotype of the titular character regularly stuffing her face with food. All of the other family members are so cruel to this poor girl, but she's mostly in the background, which is kind of a shame. I wish it had more scenes like the one of her in the pool, going between one imaginary lover and another.The story instead revolves around her sister (age 15) being taken advantage of by a college boy she meets on vacation, starting with being manipulated into anal sex with her little sister in the room. I wish I could say that's the worst moment the film gives us, but it's not. I liked how it showed the young girl's perspective as she struggles to say no but at the same time, feels like doing so will make her lose him, but this scene (and others) were unnecessarily excessive, and went on far longer than necessary. There's simply not enough intelligence or nuance here. There's an obvious parallel between what happens at the end and how the boyfriend behaved, but good lord, it has all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. It's also criminal that Breillat chose to cast an actual 13-year-old for the part. And in an extra bit of sickness, do we see a glimmer in the character actually having gotten what she wanted? For a film that seems to have feminist intentions, it's not particularly kind to women, which is a shame.",-1
6,"Oddly titled 'Fat Girl' for international release, the ambiguity of the original French title of this Catherine Breillat movie is quite important as the film is equally about two sisters: one conventionally pretty and the other slightly overweight. Roxane Mesquida and Anaïs Reboux share excellent chemistry in the respective roles as a family vacation affords them a chance to indulge in their emerging sexual appetites. At times, the girls are highly competitive with Mesquida expressing contempt for the younger Reboux to look cool in front of an Italian law student they befriend; at other times though, the sisters laugh together and share intimate secrets like lifelong best friends. Some have been critical of the explicit sexual scenes here, however, Breillat keeps them minimal and a distance; indeed, in the moments when Mesquida is intimate with her newfound boyfriend, we hear everything but see nearly nothing as the camera focuses on Reboux's face, pretending to be asleep in the hotel room she shares with her sister. If there is something to hold against the film, it is the meandering second half with a lot of lengthy drives taking up much of the screen time with tension evaporating once Mesquida has gone all the way. An unexpected plot turn in the final ten minutes of the film does, however, ensure that the movie ends on a thought-provoking (if not necessarily satisfying) final note.",1
4,"I admit, there are some beautiful, irreplaceably touching moments in this, concerning first love, and sisterly love between two opposites. One girl is beautiful, a sex object of a lot of wolf whistles, who falls for a young French guy, while holidaying with her younger, plump sister who adores food. She of course envies her, and so much wants a boyfriend, as seen by her kissing a pool pole, fantasizing it's the real thing. The especially funny scene is when the older sister and boyfriend who have just met, are sharing a perpetual kiss in an outdoor cafe, while little sister, cross seated on, watches on, while devouring her sundae/coppa. From there our love birds really get intimate sharing a raunchy night of intimacy in the girl's big bedroom, while little sister watches on there as well. These unhurried scenes have already carried half of the movie, where the fireworks between mother and daughter soon play out, and they are soon packing up and going home, the following twenty minutes is pointless, and has no substance, save for a shocking finale, something I admit, I never saw coming, which is no apology. Brielliat has done better, here. There is a coming of age story, but not enough of it to carry it through as a film, in this strung tale, that relies on very few scenes, despite good performances. Brielliat's other pics of higher rank, are far better, this a one off. Mesquida is hot, though. The title song, sung, by the younger sister, stays with me.",-1
7,"French director Catherine Breillat has a reputation for making sexually explicit films. In Fat Girl, the lead, Anais is overweight, twelve years old, and a frustrated virgin. Her older sister, Elena, is beautiful and thin. While at a resort at a beach in France, they discuss their plans for losing their innocence. Elena is waiting for love and Anais just wants to get it over with. They meet a student, Fernando, who is invited to their bedroom. Mom and dad are heavy sleepers and oblivious. After begging all night Elena submits to anal sex, with her sister nearby. The next morning, the threesome go to the beach where Fernando presents Elena with an expensive opal ring. It works like a charm, because that night they have sexual intercourse. Uh oh, big mistake; here comes Fernando's mother, looking for her ring.The girl's mother decides to drive them back home. They stop at a rest area to nap, and a man with bad intentions, armed with an axe shows up. The climax is not what I expected, but it certainly is original and surprising, given that Fat Girl was made by a female director. ,",1
8,"Director Breillat is back and, as she did with ""Romance"", pushing the bounds of censorship in an intellectually challenging fashion. The story follows the sexual development of two sisters in their early teens. Their middle class family embody the usual social mores and protective attitudes. Moreover, the story makes us aware of the legal dilemma of under age sex, undertaken as a matter of conscious choice and with proper protection by the 15-year old (older) sister with a boyfriend only a few years her senior (ie the relationship would be legal in Netherlands but not in many countries, including France). These are two fairly ""normal"" sisters, although the younger one is excessively overweight and only fantasizes about getting a boyfriend. There is some possible interpretation that the 15-year old's psychological development would progress more soundly were she not (initially) fettered by taboos over her own virginity. In one scene, a TV in the background has a Breillat-type character being interviewed and giving her philosophy about the intrinsic nature of sex, how it is something common to us all and that can be understood by anyone, and that we are all alike inasmuch as no-one is perfect. The characters and scenes are painted brilliantly, the sibling rivalry coupled with intense sisterly bonding, the mother driving at night and, as many people will have, with a lack of sleep and so not as perfectly safely as normal. It is the realism and ordinariness of the situations that keep us on the edge of our seats. The dialogue has the realism that suggests youngsters may have suggested some of the lines, with their observations that have the power to startle us out of complacency. The use of actors so young in fairly explicit scenes will be a matter of great concern, but Breillat is serious about her work and convinces us that she is not pandering to sensationalism but raising valid questions about how we effectively handle the challenges presented by precocious adolescents. The film is more polished than Breillat's earlier work and has an unnerving denouement, well-delivered.",1
9,"""Fat Girl"" is unrated so probably will never be shown in sex ed classes for 14-year-old girls willing to read the subtitles of a French film. Too bad. Written and directed by Catherine Breillat, whose other controversial movies about girls and sex I've somehow missed and will now catch up on, the original title of ""A ma soeur!"" (to, or maybe colloquially for, my sister) makes a lot more sense.But not since the very scary ""Smooth Talk"" have I seen the seduction of a pretty teen-ager by a hunky older guy shown so effectively, as this is a whole lot more explicit and sensually realistic in how they interact in a cagey game of alluring naiveté vs. determined persuasion.Unlike ""American Beauty"" whose quasi-pedophilia I found disturbing, this is a sophisticated view of the powerful forces unleashed between a guy young enough to be attracted yet old enough to know better, and a girl old enough to be attracted yet young enough not to know better. Is he the banality of evil, an update of Sportin' Life or the snake -- or is he just being a guy? In class, the teacher could stop the tape in the middle of the dialog and action, and say ""Whoa, girls, what could you say when he says that? When he does that? When you feel like that?""And we watch this all played out in a fascinating way, from the viewpoint of, with devastating impact on, her younger, titular sister who has to endure an up close and personal intimacy with them under the noses of oblivious parents.While the sibling relationship is the anchor, the ending may be a culminating precautionary statement on a very negative view of the battle of the sexes, but no one walking out of the theater was sure.The Ontario Film Review Board missed the educational point in censoring the film, but I concur that it's a disturbing film.Listening to Top 40 radio on the way home sure made me suspicious of all those declarations of love pouring out from all those guys.Coincidentally, I re-saw the Rohmer film ""Pauline on the Beach"" hours later on IFC and now see that Breillat is making a dark commentary on that classic, both riffing off a 14-year-old on vacation amidst a sexual whirligig; the French may have a different reaction than me.(originally written 10/27/2001)",1
6,"First off - FAT GIRL is not a ""bad"" film. It's actually a pretty solid coming-of-age tale that ends up being marred by the ""shocking"" ending which comes totally out of left field. There's an interesting story to be told here, too bad it gets cut short by the end-scenes, which feel to me as though they were included strictly for shock-value and to liven up the film a bit, or as a way to abruptly conclude a film without committing to any real resolution.A family on vacation repeatedly shows the audience their dysfunctions, especially amongst the two young sisters - one a 15 year old beauty, the other, her slightly younger sister who is the ""fat girl"". During the vacation, the hotter sister meets an older boy who uses all of the typical adolescent/young-adult lines to get her to give up the goods. Of course this works - and we get some relatively explicit (full-frontal from the chick, guy shows his boner, no penetration) lolita scenes. The mother finds out about her daughter's deflowering and starts the long drive home. There's lots of crying and finger-pointing between the mother and two daughters, and eventually the mother tires and pulls over at a rest-stop for the night. As the mother and hotter sister are sleeping in the front seat ***Spoilers*** out of nowhere - a hatchet wielding maniac smashes in the windshield, hits hot sister over the head with the hatchet (killing her) and strangles the mother to death. Fat Girl runs into the woods where she is pursued by psycho-hatchet-wielder who then rapes her. The cops find the crime scene with Fat Girl as the sole survivor...THE END...FAT GIRL reminded me too much of another over-rated ""shocker"" - IRREVERSIBLE, in that most of what will be talked about in the film is the one scene of brutal violence. In FAT GIRL's case, there's some (simulated) under-age sex too to cry about for all the morality-cops out there, but for the most part - the shock scenes are all that anyone's gonna notice. It's a shame too, as unlike IRREVERSIBLE which I found dull and with no real ""point"" - FAT GIRL's story of lost youth and innocence and familial discontent are universal concepts and were handled rather well until the completely disjointed and out-of-place ending. Now, I dig shock films way more than the average film viewer - but unfortunately the ending of FAT GIRL just seemed like a cheap cop-out to an otherwise decent film. Again, not a terrible film (hence my slightly above average rating) - but my disappointment in both the ending of the film and the hype I'd heard surrounding it, drop this one down several notches...6/10",1
6,"Unlike other French films that frequently delve into the subject of teenage love and sex this effort offers a more tougher (and at times realistic) viewpoint and ends up using violence to make a statement. The ending to this film has angered and confused many viewers and while I'm the first to say that it was probably unnecessary I still think this is something that should be viewed and talked about. Story is about two teenage sisters that are staying with their parents in a resort town while on vacation and while discussing the subject of losing their virginity they find out that they have opposite opinions. Elena (Roxane Mesquida) is 15 and very pretty and she wants to save herself for true love but her overweight 12 year old sister Anais (Anais Pingot) declares that she would rather it be to a stranger so that it will be over and done.*****SPOILER ALERT***** Elena meets 21 year old Fernando (Libero De Rienzo) who's a law student and he ends up sneaking into the two sisters bedroom at night for some fun but Elena tells him that she's saving her virginity although he still manages to talk her into two other forms of intimacy. Eventually Fernando does have intercourse with Elena but her mother (Arsinee Khanjian) finds out and gets very upset to the point that she cancels the rest of the vacation and pours her two daughters into the car so that they can drive back home. During the long drive Elena's mother is still fuming and tells her that they might have her inspected which would add to her humiliation but things unexpectedly turn tragic when the three of them are attacked while at a rest stop.Director Catherine Breillat has not only dealt before with the theme of exploring ones sexuality she's pretty much made her whole career out of it and she's always been a filmmaker that's been deemed controversial so I wasn't entirely shocked by the sudden ending. If one can (somewhat) try and forget the last 10 minutes they might remember that everything that came before it is actually pretty interesting starting with the fact that Breillat makes the younger sister the wisest of the two. Being a woman Breillat offers no sympathy to young female characters in her films since she understands their motives like the pretty Elena who want's love before sex but forces herself to believe Fernando's words and allows him to have his way. Breillat once again doesn't shy away from nudity in her films and here there is an extended sequence with Fernando and Elena in bed that lasts probably well over 15 minutes with the two of them naked as he seduces her and in case you were wondering...yes, that's a prosthetic penis he's wearing which explains his brief but horse hung appearance. Those who are confused by the ending might want to remember that Anais wanted to lose herself to a stranger not to mention that the assailant killed her pretty sister and chose to have sex with her instead but my question is did Breillat need that type of ending to make her point? I don't think so and you can't argue with those who hated it but I do think this is a thought provoking film that deserves not only a viewing but a tough discussion afterward. That's more than enough reason to recommend this and you have to respect any director who offers a challenge to it's audience which is what Breillat has been doing for some time.",1
10,"Catherine Breillat's ""Fat Girl"" (2001) is an astounding movie that provides uncompromising and unblinking look at the relationship between two teenage sisters, and their first sexual experiences. The older sister, 15 years old Elena, has no problems attracting boys' attention and sexual desire and while on the family vacation, she meets an older, more experienced boy, who will say and promise anything to seduce her. There are two long, thorough and uncomfortable scenes of seducing Elena that take place in the girls' bedroom with the younger sister, 12 years old Anais, the fat girl of the title not quite asleep. Breillat remembers well what the hell it is to be a teenager, to be confused, frustrated, to think low of yourself, to be ready to enter the world of sexual relationships, to be ready for love, for intimate closeness and to pretend that you don't care about them at all. She also looks closely and with none a gram of sentimentality into siblings' and parents daughters relationship. The scenes of cruelty and contempt the older sister treats the younger one alternate with rare but poignant moments of tenderness and understanding. Breillat takes us to places we don't go often and we don't want to go but they exist. If you've seen Brellat's movies already, you know that her outlook is not particularly happy, optimistic, or sentimental but ""Fat Girl"" will shock you as very few movies can. Just when you think that the movie is over and despite the disappointments, embarrassing revelations, and shameless manipulations, live goes on and has so much to offer, Breillat presents you with the final scene that is very difficult to watch and impossible to forget. It does not matter really if the final scene actually took place or was just a fantasy, just the dream projected on the screen.",1
3,"After 40 min or so, following the dullest (almost) sex scene in cinematic history, I applied the Bob Taylor Rule,...which states that if the director, screenwriter or star of a film is a certified butthole (as is Harvey Weinstein fan, Catherine Breillhat) I will only put up with it if it is indisputably great...and pulled the plug.",-1
4,"I am a fan of foreign films for they go directly to areas that American Cinema ""dances"" around or softens sometimes just to make sure box office receipts wont be affected. Make no mistake, this film may offend, confuse but most of all make you discuss it's flaws or its potential brilliance. For me, its familiar to flawed.The first thing I have to point out that does add to the flaw is the American translation of the film's title. I am no French Language expert, but the translation of the title ""Fat Girl"" for American Audiences to the French words ""With My Sister"" means a lot to how one would interpret this film. The latter title is more fitting than the first - and that could be where those who see the film discover points of confusion.For me, it was a ""coming of age"" tale that involves two sisters on vacation with their parents - one sister pleasantly thin, the other, obnoxiously fat. The film takes great pains to make sure the viewer is aware of the fat and thin differences. But it also gives you a glimpse into the heart of female siblings, one of the only redeeming characteristics of this film for me.What comes between them besides food and the obligatory ""take your sister with you anywhere you go"" mandate is...a man. Nothing new here. Nothing new about this tale of coming of age of sexual discovery in female adolescence. And nothing new about the rivalry and jealousy between two sisters - be them fat or thin, younger or older on this subject. That interaction was clear and honest, and was the best part of the film for me.Where the film drops from that peak into something so questionable is the ending of the film that begs to ask the question - ""Why go there?"". Is the director making a commentary on today's society as a whole? To make the viewer go back and look at the events of this family and how there wasn't any way for them to come to a conclusion of the events of this vacation other than this? Or was it for the viewer to pinpoint how ignored, alone and mentally abused this character was? This is something to talk about and discuss, I don't think with any clear endings albeit symbolic, abstract or spot on. Unnecessary...? Or more of an artistic license that is way over the top to make a small point?This is a film for all who view will see that everyone has an opinion. It's fine that film can do that, and I love when it does. But on the other hand, this is not a foreign film I would care to remember or recommend unless I tacked on the phrase: ""...if you have nothing else to see, check this one out.""",-1
6,"This otherwise fairly run of the mill late '70s porno is elevated above the norm by an impossibly groovy disco soundtrack. For more info, check out the other comment and color me  for one  impressed ! Allow me to fill you in on some of the additional details as to some of the people on both sides of the camera. Director ""Carl LaBlanche"" was actually the late John Christopher, a modestly talented filmmaker responsible for flicks like BABE and VELVET HIGH. Cinematographer ""Anna Riva"" proves to be none other than exploitation queen Roberta Findlay and I've got a hunch that producer ""J. Angel Martine"", linked to so many of her directorial efforts, might be yet another alias for the lady herself. Everyone involved has done much better elsewhere but the cult reputation of many should assure a good deal of interest for the adult film aficionado and/or completist.Brunette Arcadia Lake and blonde Jean Jennings (the one time Mrs. Joe Spinell and unforgettable star of Armand Weston's incredible DEFIANCE) are high school girls on their last day of summer vacation. As they get bored waiting for their boyfriends to show up, they put on a disco record (a picture disc, actually, remember those ?) and shake their booty while stripping down. Can a lesbo liaison be far behind ? Nah ! I've got to admit the double dong (something dad brought back from his trip to Europe, Arcadia explains, which kind of makes you wonder about the guy) came as a bit of a surprise though. It certainly does to the girls' paramours (stalwart studs Eric Edwards and Ron Hudd) who are sneaking a peek through the window, snapping shots for the school paper ! Once they make their presence known, the movie reverts to the ""loop carrier"" format as Edwards relates how his passion for photography landed him into various types of trouble whenever he turned his lens towards naked ladies. Cue the introduction of the film's biggest star, in more ways than one, the late great John Curtis Holmes who plays Captain Tom, owner of the ""Chug-a-Lug"", a lovely little yacht that doesn't have to leave the harbor to give you motion sickness, if you catch my drift ! First up is a below deck orgy centered around pretty, part Native American (so her lead in Ann Perry's rather silly SWEET SAVAGE wasn't a total put-on) Beth Anna who's covered in whipped cream as she's being mauled by Edwards, Al Levitsky a/k/a ""Roger Caine"", Shaun Costello's ""Dan McCord"" alter ego. There's another barely glimpsed actress in this scene, blink and you'll be unable to identify her as Clea Carson, the stewardess living across the street from pervert Jamie Gillis in WATERPOWER, who performs here with massively endowed Peter Andrews, the waiter with Susan McBain in Radley Metzger's BARBARA BROADCAST.Legendary Serena is easy enough to identify. She plays ""Candy Johnson"" and, boy oh boy, she certainly likes short shorts ! She performs two scenes with the humongously hung Holmes (one on the boat and one outdoors) and while neither ranks among her all time hottest true genre fans will not want to miss out on this superstar combination. The leads get it on next. Exotic Arcadia (who died of a drug overdose some years later) works with then real life boyfriend Eric while Jean, looking a lot like Melissa Joan Hart (TV's SABRINA), has Ron. While she did scenes with other women, Arcadia was pretty much a one man woman, meaning she was usually a second stringer. Whenever she did play the lead, it was usually in some low rent production like this or HONEY THROAT, Jeff Fairbanks' terrific American PIE proving an exception to the rule. To fill out the brief running time, Edwards tells of how he caught his brother in flagrante with his black girlfriend. This was obviously some loop that had been lying around and it's impossible to identify who's in it as there's not a single facial close-up as to preserve anonymity ! Shots of Eric snapping away are inserted but the striking difference in picture quality reveals that he was most definitely never in the same room.",1
8,"Some of the best film achievements have come and will come from places which are under social and political pressure and are being created by film directors who are deeply involved in the life of their countries and have both the talent to make cinematographic art out of their questions and fears, and the courage to make films that reflect their concerns and reach their own audiences as well as the international ones. ""Abluka"" (Frenzy) which is only the second film of director Emin Alper was released in 2015, one year before the failed coup and the political actions that followed it in Turkey. It presents a deeply disturbing and dystopian view of the realities of a country hit by terrorism and answering it with the means of force. Hard to say if this is the reality of today or a projection in the future, but after all there are many people who consider the world we live in with its violence, terrorism, repression a dystopian version of the world we used to know and live in ten or twenty years ago, and maybe here we see (or dream as in a nightmare) a cautionary version of the world of tomorrow.The lead characters of the film live in a miserable slum in the outskirts of a big Turkish city, a typical incubator of violence and terror. We see in the background the shining towers of a modern city and do hear the explosions of the terror attacks that hit it but the life of the two heroes are obviously buried in poverty. They are in a figurative and non-figurative manner the scavengers of their world, performing some of the unwanted jobs that support the system: the older brother just released from prison collects garbage and is a police informer, the youngest one kills stray dogs. A third brother had disappeared suddenly from their lives a decade ago. They try to adapt and do their best to survive, but they have a hard time communicating, even with each other, and the pressure of the world around overwhelms them. The sliding slope of their lives seems inevitable.The story plays permanently with the balance between sanity and insanity, between reality and and the nightmares of the two heroes. From some point ahead it becomes unclear if what we see on screen is reality, or the nightmares of the two brothers, or maybe the life around became one big nightmare. The wonderful acting of Mehmet Özgür and Berkay Ates, makes us share their fears and claustrophobia. The situations the two find themselves are difficult but are not their fault, and actually, if we try to understand their personal perspectives, each of them makes sense. They try to do their best to play inside the system while keeping their human feelings. So, if the two characters behave rationally maybe the insanity belongs to the world that surrounds them? the world that surrounds us? This film with its grim vision and the tragic fate of its heroes is not easy to watch, but it is true and impressing, the work of a talented film maker.",1
9,"Armored vehicles rumble through the outskirts of Istanbul and shatter windows of cinder block homes as they pass, bombs explode in the night, trash fires burn, attack helicopters roam the skies and soldiers with machine guns shout at checkpoints. After twenty years in prison this is the environment that Kadir enters. His parole is granted on the condition that he become an informant for the police. Thus Kadir begins to gather clues about terrorist activities from trash bins, a woman's muffled scream in the darkness and a lone motorcycle fleeing from authorities. Kadir's brother Ahmet lives in the same area. Ahmet was never in prison and yet his existence is just as bleak as that of his brother. Ahmet hunts stray dogs for a bounty and leaves poison for them, or anything else that might chance across it, in the streets.and people, like the stray dogs, are cast with suspicion and hunted down. This is the world of Ahmet and Kadir. In such darkness, mistrust and chaos their enemies are not just those around them, but also themselves.While the film is fiction, it mirrors the real situation in Turkey. ""Everyone is sitting in their holes and sniping at each other,"" said the director ""and the neighborhood and its people are caught in the crossfire."" This film about the Turkish underground is tense, dark and brooding. There are multiple conflicts going on and fear, distrust and conspiracy-thinking are rampant. The director wisely lets the audience determine what is real and what is not. The images are gloomy yet luminous in what they reveal about human nature. I wish the director was able to use sound and music as well as the images. The film is the winner of a jury prize in Venice. Four and a half of five stars. Seen at the Toronto International Film Festival 2015.",1
3,"I read comments on this movie, and it caused me to watch it. I thought it was something special.
There is a problem on this movie, and it is darkness. As the basic of this is stupid mind, you feel you are watching a black and white film, light is the one you like but there is no light. As the theory and screenplay are dark enough like black. You wish please turn on lights, i want to see something interesting. But the movie likes to be as dark as possible, there is no light and kindness inside this movie.
Making movies about bad people, is not what makes a film good when it is hopeless. Hope no1 is curing a dog, Hope no2 is a smell like kissing. Silence even for a dog. No one might knows i have a dog. Cause i am a dog killer. I cannot save anyone even at sleeping in my dreams. There is a big negative feeling of what make a man as stupid as possible. To be honest you never think you are watching a film which might be real, close to be a true story? It is completely fake and unreal. You never can put yourself between roles and try to think what is true, and what is wrong. And there is only one reason. This story is about a man whom is one in billion. Coming out of jail to be a spy, then for being successful you lead your brother to be a terrorist, really? What is my IQ? Below zero?
So it is unbelievable story! Low quality camera, weak screenplay, bad acts, totally nothing interesting inside, as the dark evil scene of black color. The director did not know any other colors except black. Deep black.",-1
8,"Jail and sack fear process curvaceously Two different branch of the story merge at the end so we understand significantly. But for the processing of the characters anxiety, I think some of the scenes are unnecessarily long. Although certain police scenes could have shot better but maybe this nonprofessional feature especially selected for the dystopic property. We watch an open-ended final. these hallucinations are real or these are the indirect result of the authority. This is not certain. Up to you.Also increasing of the mystery gradually through final this is nice feature.Mehmet Özgür's acting is perfect. I think the movie deserve 7 points but for this reason I give 8 points.",1
7,"Saw this film at TIFF a few nights ago and it certainly made an impression on me. The lines between nightmare and reality blurred over the course of the protagonist's descent into paranoia. Set in a war torn ghetto of a militarized Istanbul the film builds suspense from the mystery resulting in leaving several key questions about the characters and their past unanswered. This makes the ambiguity of the characters' increasing agitation and delusion. My friend who accompanied me to the theatre was quite negative following the screening, questioning ""What am I supposed to take away from this that I can use?"". I honestly didn't have an answer for him, but if you're looking for a tight psychological drama I would certainly recommend this film.",1
7,A better episode. I really enjoyed the bar scenes which give Majors plenty to do and as a big fan of Ted Raimi I was delighted by his inclusion here in a typically quirky role. The 'killer car' scenes are a lot of gruesome fun too.,1
8,"To be honest, almost anything would be a comedown after the brilliance of episode 2, but Tony Tilse still delivers the goods. As far as I'm concerned, he could direct every episode, such is his deft handling of absurd humour and gross out special effects.Last Call sees local teens stealing Ash's beloved Delta, unaware that the car contains the Necronomicon. When one of the teens finds the book and reads from it, the car becomes possessed and begins to kill the kids. Meanwhile, Ash is still trying to convince his father Brock (Lee Majors) of the impending evil that threatens the Earth.Although Tilse tones it down slightly after The Morgue, there's still a few scenes that register highly on the gore-ometer, my favourite being the car's spinning wheel tearing off the face of one of the teens. The car also chops off one lad's fingers and catapults a hub cap though another's chest. In the bar, Ash and his old friend Chet (Ted Raimi) mix up a batch of drinks with a name that I cannot type in IMDb, and our hero battles a deadite trying to kill Brock, who at last realises that his son is a hero after Ash chops off the demon's head in the toilet bowl.At the end of the show, Brock reveals to Ash that he has been harbouring a secret, but doesn't get a chance to say what it is.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",1
7,"When local teenagers steal Ash's car from Brock's house, Ash and his pal Chet plan a party at the bar to lure them and take back the car and the Necronomicon.I love how this show keeps getting creative, the 'evil car' is a simplistic yet effective idea, it's like the possessed cabin but it moves. As 'evil' as it sounds, I also like the creative way of killing off the characters, like the one with tires screeching over the dude's face, it's spine-chiling. But despite the goriness of this episode, there are some tender moments like Ash and his dad having fun and the latter finally realizing his son is a 'hero'.overall, this an impressive episode with good concept. the special effects, score and cinematography are all top-notch. 8/10.",1
7,"Only the last five minutes safe this episode from becoming a complete snooze-fest. It is not that it is horrible, it is that not much actually happens.On one side we have the ""stupid-we-want-to-die"" youth that stole Ash's car, that play their role of we-will-hung-around-till-we-are-killed-so-we-fill-time. On the other, Ash and the rest of the team, who come up with a very silly plan to make the youth appear with the car and the book: organize a party at the local bar (whose barman is one Ted Raimi). But nothing much happens that is fun, surprising or entertaining on each side of the story and the first twenty minutes advance at a snail's pace.In the car, one of the girls reads from the book, she is possessed, the car is possessed, we have blood, people running, tires running over heads. Nothing new under the sun, just much heads exploding, again the show running the thin line between horror and horror-gore. In these last two episodes instead of horror-comedy it has been more gore-comedy. In the bar, it is all a lost opportunity. We have some Ash-dad competition, but with a bar, drunk people and deadites, it could have been way better. There are no zingers, Campbell sleepwalks, Pablo and Kelly have nothing to do, and Lawless's Ruby doesn't add much to the team dynamic. Wasted opportunity.At the end things come to life, thanks to a couple of funny moments, and some plot development. But ""Ash vs Evil Dead"" should offer more than that. It is becoming too happy with itself.",1
7,"At 17, I still absolutely love the Lion King. It was the first film I ever saw in the cinema, and even now I marvel at the amazing animation, music, humour and voice acting. In this show, the zany characters Timon and Pumbaa, who along with Sebastian and Flounder, The Three Good Fairies and Jaq and Gus are my favourite Disney sidekicks are the main attraction. The show itself is uneven, but it is still very entertaining.Animation: There are times when it isn't great, sometimes a little shoddy and static and some of the characters who features are occasionally wonkily animated, but when the animation is good it is good. When it is good, the backgrounds are colourful, the colours audacious and the characters move convincingly.Music: The irresistible and hilarious Hukuna Matata, which I consider one of my favourite songs from the Lion King, serves as the theme tune for this show. And you know what, it still works. I always find myself singing along, and for me that is a glorious feeling. And the incidental music is above decent as well.Story lines/quotes: I do agree that some of the story lines are predictable, repetitive and silly, but there are some funny and cute moments. And there are some funny quotes in my opinion, with Timon and Pumbaa's witty bantering quite inspired.Voices/characters: I know there are some people who find Timon and Pumbaa annoying, personally I really like them. They both have flaws, Timon being selfish and Pumbaa being naive, but they are both very funny and charming. Rafiki and the hyenas sometimes make guest appearances, the episodes with the hyenas are good(not great mind you), but Rafiki's are just okay. The voice acting is great, Ernie Sabella is wonderful as Pumbaa, and while Kevin Schon lacks the impeccable comic timing of Nathan Lane, he does an above average job, as does Quentin Flynn. Veteran voice actor Jim Cummings is brilliant as always with voice of Ed the hyena.Overall, Timon and Pumbaa is uneven, but it is entertaining. And as a matter of fact it is something I recommend for kids. 7/10 Bethany Cox",1
6,"Timon and Pumba the iCONIC pig and rodent from the legendary movie called The Lion King.After making their debut in Lion King after they helped save the pride Timon and Pumba continue their adventure in the jungle.It was a fun cartoon. It was innocent, funny and the characters were just as they were in the movie. Usually movie to TV shows suck bad. This show however was good enough.What can be learned? The Hakuna Matata song.Verdict: No Worries...",1
10,"Because of the trend that was being formed for all the Disney Afternoon cartoons back in the day, I was hoping for a ""Lion King"" cartoon to come out. And it did!!!!! The cartoon was called ""Timon and Pumbaa,"" created in 1995 and shown on The Disney Afternoon for a couple years then.Like with ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Aladdin,"" more adventures have sprung up for the main characters - those being Timon the Meerkat and Pumbaa the Warthog (a.k.a. MR. PIG)! I liked all the new characters and the new enemies (they were soooo funny!!!!!), and there were some episodes that had only the Hyenas or Rafiki, and those were good, too! Note: I mentioned about Mr. Pig because of what Pumbaa sometimes said when he was called a name:""What did you call me????? What did you call me?????? WHAT DID YOU CALL ME?????THEY CALL ME.....MR. PIg!Aaaaahhhhhhhhh!!!!!""Man, this show was the classic!!!!!10 stars",1
8,"Timon & Pumbaa is an animated spin-off from the Lion King. The series actually works pretty well for television with Pumbaa and Timon's Hakuna-Matata life style, I wouldn't call it anything special but nor would I expect it to be since it's made for TV. Guys, of course Timon and Pumbaa are gonna be similar to Looney Tunes at times with some unoriginal humor, it's made for TV from 90's television. Atleast it's not a whole new Disney sequel, I mean they actually got there own sequel in 2004 being The Lion King 1 1/2. But here it's a simply entertaining spin-off where the two try to find bugs, keep their personal items safe, and even learn about friendship. We even see Simba, Rafiki, Zazu, and the hyenas from time to time who also get their very own segments as well. It seems nice that we get to focus on each character a bit separately in their own situations, but also when they're together, but it is kind of rare. I also really like the intro this series provides, it's like a remix of Hakuna Matata but only with Timon and Pumbaa which seems pretty cool in my opinion. The animation seems okay for TV quality, not bad or great. It's just the very simple television quality that shouldn't be in Disney's direct-to-video sequels. You can't expect it to even look like the quality of Simba's Pride when they have to work with a television budget. Most of the voice actors reprise their roles yet Timon apparently has had over 3 of them here. Not sure why but they all sound about the same and that's all that matters. This is a decent fun television show with my two favorite Lion King characters with cartoonish gags and some 90's animation humor. It used to be on Toon Disney until Toon Disney was replaced with Disney XD, it aired on Disney Junior during its early debut but now you can watch it on Disney+.",1
10,"In the 80s and 90s it was TV war with 1000 of channels to watch, and now this decade and last decade this os streaming war. With the bland hype of Lion King 2019 out of the way let us rewind to Timon & Pumbaa. No groundbreaking TV show just some 10 minute fun per episode with references that adults will love like Stand By Me that fits the light tone of the show.",1
9,"Timon and Pumbaa is a nice show for kids of all ages, sad to admit it but I still watch it at my age. I find most of the story lines to be fairly entertaining but at times if You have the wrong storyline, and the Character just doesn't fit it makes the difference. By that I mean at times in the show there would be a bland story with Timon and Pumbaa that would have fit well with another Character, and made it more interesting to watch, simple mistake in all honesty. The show offers some simple lessons for kids while stepping from being to corny or to preachy. The Realism of the show is not like in the movie, and the laws of nature don't seem to apply, but that is not a big issue for Me, I think it expands I child's imagination.Although the show is very good, there is one thing I would like to add about it, they should have involved Simba a little more because He was only in about three episodes, He made The Lion King practically! I also think a series featuring Timon and Pumbaa wasn't the greatest idea, personally I feel they should have used cub Simba and cub Nala to give it more spice.Overall the show Is great for an afternoon cartoon after school, and You will enjoy it, one day it may even be considered classic.",1
6,"""Timon and Pumbaa"" was a TV spin-off of the amazing Disney film ""The Lion King"". It ran for 3 seasons with a total of 85 episodes on CBS from 1995-1999.""Timon and Pumbaa"" (much like the ""Aladdin"" TV series) was a lot goofier and crazier when compared to the movie it was based on. For example, all of the weird characters. Especially Criminal Quint, who was actually human. Who ever thought we would see a human in a the ""Liom King"" series? But the goofiness does (in some ways) give the show a certain charm, I just really think Quint was a bad idea.The animation isn't so great in this show either. I know their budget is smaller since it's a TV show, but I know they could've done better. Especially since this show was made in the '90s, and there were a LOT of cartoon shows in the '90s with great animation (""Animaniacs""; ""Ren & Stimpy""; ""The Simpsons""). Also this is Disney we're talking about. The biggest media company in the world! I guess they don't care that much when it comes to television.""Timon and Pumbaa"" is a decent show though. It was pretty funny, the animation was..... okay, the voice acting was great, and the show was overall pretty enjoyable. However it's not perfect, it is a little too goofy sometimes, and some episodes flat-out sucked.Rating: 6/10 ""Decent""",1
8,"This show shows alot of dark and funny moments including timon and pumbaa almost get eaten, getting chased, gets scolded, and being set up by including quint(the famous villain in the whole series). This show is fun filled adventure. It's a weird show but it's pretty funny. And for the mpaa rating, rated Y which can be accessible for anybody including babies but there are alot of harmful or scary stuff in the show that can scare little kids even babies. I would recommend watching this if your trying to get caught up on timon and pumbaa universe. Timon and pumbaa are weird because they crave bugs and sucks juices from them *yuck*. I would not eat anything if I were you if your in a scene with them eating bugs. But this show alot of fun to watch. It has 2 segments each totaling 20-30 minutes per episode. And shows a nice title card for the episode which is very nice. Content warnings:
This show is recommended for anybody but shows some dark moments so depeninding on your, your children's or parents age, I would sat with the kids to make sure they are not scared and changing the channel. In my opinion, this show is awesome. It is childish at times but you will love the show.",1
10,THIS SHOW ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
4,"This television show's been brought back to the Disney Channel. I saw it for the first time not too long ago, and I must say I was somewhat disappointed, though my judgment is biased.(I love The Lion King, so I guess I had high expectations.) But, this show's animation isn't exactly what I'd call good. It's basically Ren and Stimpy, but to my TLK-obsessed dismay, with Timon and Pumbaa.Criminal Quint is painfully annoying. It's my opinion that they should have used a more Lion King-related villain, such as a lion or hyena, but I guess I'm just being picky.A few jokes were funny, I have to admit. I just think that it could use a tad less slapstick jokes, and incorporate the original movies a little more.4/10. I've seen worse, but it's not exactly Grammy material...",-1
6,"Okay yeah, ""Timon and Pumbaa"" isn't exactly a Disney masterpiece, but personally, I love the show. Yes, the animation is pretty much crap. Yes, a lot of the plot lines are incredibly simple if not stupid (I wanted to shoot myself when I realized I had spent 15 minutes watching T&P trying to hit a golf ball). But for every cliché loony-tunes rip-off, there are a lot of really cute, really funny moments in the show. Episodes such as when Timon's ""mom"" comes to dinner or that gorilla mistakes T&P for babies or when T&P find Pumbaa Jr. or the episode ""Bumble in the Jungle"" (aka Fantasia Toon Dinsey Style)...these are the episodes that make me really wish Disney would put this show on DVD. And even in some of the dumber episodes, there are always one or two moments when you find yourself laughing at the crazy banter between T&P (example- in Uganda be an Elephant- check out the ""backwards not forgetting"" sequence). Face it, these two are the animated version of Abbott and Costello. Personally, I'll latch upon any outlet I can to watch these two.",1

6,"Following the death of his son, Jorge travels from conservative Bolivia to NYC to confront Sebastian, who was his son's lover. While he struggles to accept the life of his son, Sebastian begins to write a play that celebrates his deceased lover.Tu Me Manques was the official selection for the Best International Feature Film in the 2019 Academy Awards. Now, it's available in America.The title, which means I Miss You, tells the story of Gabriel's life intercut with the idealized version of his life within Sebastian's play. Meanwhile, we follow Jorge as he searches New York City to try and find something to remember of his son.Gabriel is played by several actors in this - within the real life of the movie and the play within it - and his suicide hangs over the future of every person that remains. This is an emotional watch but one worth viewing.",1
4,"This is a poorly told story that uses a bad script and terrible cinematography. The audio is bad, and the confused editing doesn't provide much continuity for viewers. If it tried to be less ""artistic"" and more realistic, it could have been a good film. In its present iteration, it's just .....stupid and unfulfilling.",-1

3,Movie make no sense if this was really based in a play. Where is the play? No mention of the play based on the main story. The play came from nothing and no meaning at all. Sound is awful. At least have subtitles in English. Some of the Spanish hard to understand or hear.,-1
5,"This film could be a winner, but the acting made me stop watching it several times. Sometimes less is more and trying to show so many emotions at the same time confuses the viewer and it becomes silly. I loved some lines, that shows depth and intelligence. When you're too angry at others, you're angry at yourself, I guess. The soundtrack is brilliant. I expected more and I feel robbed.",-1
10,"An undoubted highlight of the (sadly coronavirus-related truncated) Melbourne Queer Film Festival 2020, the rich emotionality of this astoundingly brilliantly written and acted movie far transcends some potentially intrusive and distracting storytelling devices (primarily the portrayal of the main character's ex-boyfriend by three actors, sometimes intercut and alternated within the same scene). The truly beautiful Tommy Heleringer as possibly *the gayest* character ever to grace a cinema screen is a stand-out performance amongst a plethora of perfection. Just an incredible and heartbreaking film.",1
9,"The movie (which is not and doesn't want to be a/the play) is cleverly written. The emotions are given but it makes you think, not just the way you think it'd do. You have to figure out what's happening - and this is also the one negative point. Needing to put it together while watching detours the focus somewhat from the important message - but in the end it all comes together and beside it's message it becomes a valued movie experience! Well done.",1
2,"Besides the acting of the two main protagonists, the story falls into a white, golden body, and narcissistic idealism of homosexuality, which dosen't represent at all of Bolivian LGBT community.",-1
8,You have to see Tommy in Tu me manques. He steals the whole movie. I highly recommend. But the writing and his delivery are perfection in this movie.,1
5,"The original UK series was brilliant but it's American appeal was somewhat limited by the cultural differences. In the parochial, provincial, pedestrian, U.S. of A. it was felt that some translation would allow for a wider appeal. That may be so but we're off to poor start.One cannot expect an opening scene as iconic as the UK original (a slow pan back from Tony's face revealing his sexy unique bedspread while wordlessly revealing a bit of his enigmatic character) but the U.S. scene is just boring.The leads in the UK series were brilliant and their U.S. equivalents seem to be inferior copies so far but things may change.Enough of the original brilliance shines through that I'm willing to give it a few more episodes before I pull the plug.It's mostly the unrealistic nature of the supporting characters (or more rightly caricatures) that I found so annoying in the first episode. It may well be that their UK doppelgangers were JUST as artificial but my American roots may have missed the nuances.After initially posting my review , I decided to go back and view the UK and the US versions side by side to see why one was so entertaining and one was so disappointing.As I said, it starts with the opening scene. James Newman just isn't as pretty as Nicholas Hoult. He doesn't suggest the innocence one would expect to see on the face of an angel, even a fallen one like the original. Also the ""naked duo duvet"" with Nicholas' face half way between the bodies of the man and the woman in the UK opening sequence was just untoppable. By comparison the spider print is just boring.Plus there's poor editing in showing Tony's sister in the street outside too early in the sequence. It diverts our attention from making a connection with Tony. That's further hindered by Tony's practicing martial arts... again, not the most innocence evoking images.My next beef with the American version is that the minor supporting characters come off more as caricatures than in the UK version where they were still comic characters but just not so abysmally over the top.Next, the gender swapping of Maxxie for Tea may be necessary to cater to American tastes but it robs the idea that the Chris and Abbud are joining the gay character for a night at a gay bar of the sweetness of being supportive friends. The U.S. guys are reduced to just being lechers.As to the other main characters, there were numerous points where the Amercian version just seemed harder and more self-assured than their Brit counterparts. That makes them just that much harder to empathize with.Also its the minor things. In the UK version after joining the rich kids party Tony and Michelle dance together. The costumes that they wear are coordinated, until they start dancing, that's not so apparent and its a nice moment. No such moment exists in the U.S. version.Even the camera angles weren't as artistic. The scene with Cassie being dragged off the trampoline was more evocative than the US equivalent with Cadie.",-1
1,"I love the UK version of Skins. I have watched all three seasons and I am now up to the fourth season in the outrageous teen drama. It's a great series in where you can relate to it, the concepts, themes and characters.Two years ago, a pile of remakes were coming in and for the comedy genre, besides Shameless, Skins had be re-created for a new audience. Why? What on earth was the purpose for it? Money? Who knows, but what I'll say was that it was way to early for a remake to be made. I mean for gosh sake, the original series started in 2007 and it is continuing to the present. The remake aired in 2011 which is just stupid since the creators wanted to get their hands on a successful project. All I can say is like most films or TV series, this should have never been remade in the first place! I only watched the first episode of the US remake, and it is awful. Words can't express how horrid this pile of garbage is. It's exactly the same bloody thing we've seen before, accept we have a change of characters with worse personalities and there is a drastic change in atmosphere.Lets talk about the characters in this first episode. Tony in the original was excellent. He was a bad-ass, smart-ass kid who didn't take anything seriously whilst this new Tony is just undeniably trying to be a carbon copy. Instead, he comes off just being stupid. Sid who is NOW Stanley in this is just plain boring. No excitement like the original. Chris, my favorite character in the UK, totally melted and watered down here. Here he is just awful. Maxxie is now replaced with a girl called Tea. Why? I don't bloody know, but I'll say it was a stupid thing. It does nothing for me, this new character or should I say replacement for Maxxie. As for the other kids in the group, their re-portrayals of the lovable UK kids are pulled off in the worst of ways possible.As for the episode itself, its an exact copy of the original accept we have a mess up of characters and dialogue as well as scenes. The cinematography looks awful.I've watched this first episode and I have come to terms that I hate the new, and still very current version of Skins. I highly recommend that you don't watch this version at all, because after ten or so minutes, it will become boring not only in the sense of this version being a carbon copy, but also the production just being presented horribly! And I thought some American remakes were bad! Like some Horror and even Shameless. I'd rather watch them over this! I don't believe I'll be continuing on with this series in general. It's just too messy and also too the same. Boring premise and lame acting.0/10",-1
1,"Why is it we feel we have to rip off UK series and turn them ""American?"" This so called American version is such a poor imitation of the original its extremely difficult to watch. Its poorly cast, badly acted (aside from the actor playing ""Stanley"") and lacking the complexity and depth that the UK series captured. I don't have this on good authority but it appears to be filmed in Canada and the accents are clearly Canadian. The actor playing Tony is so lifeless its pathetic.All the comparisons aside, I can't help but think if I didn't see the UK series first, I would have yawned through this one or turned the channel.",-1
6,"Traveltalk travels to Madagascar and the Seychelles Islands. It's interesting that this one starts off with a map. There isn't much to the Madagascar stop other than the narration hinting at some anti-colonial troubles. There is an obsession with the rickshaw. The Seychelles look like a tropical paradise. As always, there is the listing of the races. All in all, it's a beautiful postcard but not much more.",1
4,"James A. Fitzpatrick sends the Technicolor cameras to the Indian Ocean so he can take pictures of the swimming pools on cruise ships and babble of spiders' intelligence and how most rickshaws are manufactured in Connecticut in this lackluster Traveltalks.If you've read more than a couple of my reviews for this series of travelogues, you are aware that I think they mostly have good pictures, but that Fitzpatrick's narration is foolish and shouted. This one, however, has a shortage of interesting pictures in it. Mostly we get pictures of natives downtown in the port cities, and we are treated to a long look at the young women around the aforementioned swimming pool. Fitzpatrick, in the meantime, tells us random facts, as usual. This time, however, he does not shout. That's something, I suppose.",-1
7,". . . plying its way between the COLORFUL ISLANDS: MADAGASCAR AND SEYCHELLES, they all seem to sport pale derrieres. Apparently this is because the Natives of the former rebelled against having to learn French to prosper on their Homeland, and were punished by being chained up and thrown into the drink as if they were on the AMISTAD or something. This left only the one-piece swim suit set surviving to reach the latter islet, which they dubbed ""The Garden of Eden"" because there were no ""backward, superstitious"" indigenous folks there, according to the narrator.",1
5,"FitzPatrick's ""Traveltalks"" series of shorts seem pretty quaint today. What seemed like exotic and rare glimpses into foreign lands when this episode came out in the mid-thirties could not keep the attention of a ten year old today. With 200 channels being funneled into most homes, you're bound to find exotic lands on a few of them at any given time.This one is in Technicolor, which helps, but FitzPatrick's recitation of the facts comes across as something akin to verbal Wikipedia.At just eight minutes long you'd think they would try to cram in all they could on these two locations, yet we're subjected to about a minute of a guy on a ship, traveling between the islands, diving into the ship's pool and a bunch of women climbing a ladder to get out of the pool. Made no sense at all. Maybe that was fascinating too, in the 30's.As these things go, this one is about average, but a few minutes watching the Travel channel would probably be more interesting. Can be seen now and again as one of TCM's vast array of little time killers.",-1
6,"Decent Western about a merciless revenge including a deadly confrontation between a tough avenger and his enemies , both of whom played by Spaghetti stars : Brett Halsey , Angel Del Pozo , Wayde Preston and Fernando Sancho . Fine Italian Western with sad atmosphere , marvelous musical score concerning about ordinary vengeance . It deals with a cowboy called Mike (Montgomery Ford or Brett Halsey) , at the beginning , he suddenly finds his old friend David (as Angel del Pozo) . Mike returns home after leaving it long time ago , as he arrives and encounters an eerie surprise : His house and wife have been massacred during a robbing . The nasty outlaws (Fernando Sancho , Wayde Preston , Franco Fantasia..) taking US$10,000 cash he needed to pay his farm , only seven silver dollars were left untouched . Then , Mike and David bury Jane and Barnett sets out in pursuit , as he pulls off a relentless search and revenge mission . Mike , dressed in black , seeks justice and inexorable vengeance against his contenders who wrongly killed his spouse . The main tracks result to the the valuable robbed cash . As Mike carries out blackmails and massacre against various enemies in which he must use his experience and cunning , killing each man of the gang one by one and throwing one silver dollar near each body . Along the way Mike is detained and imprisoned at the town jail , being watched by a deputy (Howard Ross) , but he escapes and goes on his vendetta . The unsettling and disturbing Mike Barnett (Montgomery Ford) , eventually supported by his friend David , proceeds his activities at whatever cost , acting as judge , jury and executioner . And the end takes place his encounter with enemies in a cave , including unexpected surprises . This is a doomed journey to hell through vengeance , murders and violence . It is a typical Spaghetti/Chorizo Western including common scenarios , two-fisted antiheroes , rapid zooms and strong confrontations full of shots , crossfire , plot twists and violence . It contains a catching soundtrack , an evocative cinematography and nice production design shot in Elios studios and Almeria , of course . This exciting Western regarding an implacable hunting down , but the cruel killings against the perpetrators should be more fun than it is , but the film seems some claustrophobic , with dark and night photography , as much of the action takes place in confined areas , deserts , defiles , including a cave for the ending showdown . Bret Halsey with pseudonym Montgomery Ford , elegantly dressed in black , plays as Mike who goes home but his dreams are shattered when Pistoleros execute a brutal slaughter , as he sees it was vandalized when bandits took the invaluable honour and life of his wife as well as his ranch and money . Brett starred several Spaghettis as ¨Kill Johnny Ringo¨ , ¨Roy Colt and Winchester Jack¨ , ¨Twenty thousand dollars for seven¨ and ¨Today We Kill, Tomorrow We Die!¨. Support cast is pretty well , it is filled with familiar faces from Spaghetti as Italian actors as Howard Ross , Dana Ghia , Franco Fantasia as Spanish players as Fernando Sancho , Antonio Padilla and Angel Del Pozo . Besides , brief appearances from American interpreter Wayde Preston who also starred a lot of Spaghettis . Evocative and thrilling musical score by Michele Lanzeranza and Roberto Pregadio in Ennio Morricone wake . The music is suitably Spaghetti with the blaring trumpets , and guitar chords . Atmospheric cinematography , plenty of lights and shades , by Mario Pacheco . Being decently filmed in Almeria , including its narrow passes , mountains and rocky outdoors , studios Dino De Laurentiis and Elios Rome , Italy . This Spaghetti Western was professionally shot by the Italian professional Albert Cardone . Albert was a prestigious assistant director to popular films as ¨Ben Hur¨, ¨Purple noon¨, ¨Cagliostro¨ , ¨Carmen¨ , ¨Don Camilo¨ , ¨Return of Don Camilo¨. And shot some films , most of them entertaining Westerns such as : ¨Blood at Sundown¨ , ¨Kidnapping¨ , ¨Il Lungo Giorno Del Massacro¨ , ¨20.000 Dollari Sul¨ , ¨L'ira Di Dio¨ and starred by usual genre stars as Brett Halsey , Gianni Garco , Peter Martell , Wayde Preston , Fernando Sancho and Anthony Steffen . Rating : Better than average 6/10 . Only for Spaghetti Western aficionados .",1
8,"Brett Halsey aka Montgomery Ford stars in this straightforward revenge saga from Alberto Cardone. He presents a thrilling protagonist, dressed all in black, implacable in his thirst for revenge against the seven men who dishonored and murdered his fiancé and stole the fifty thousand dollars with which they were going to begin a new life. Wayde Preston is one of the seven, in such a small role I expected him to turn up later, but he doesn't. Many familiar faces turn up, including Fernando Sancho and Angel del Pozo, Franco Fantasia and others, locations, some in Almeria, are fine, and the action doesn't lag. Michele Lacerenza provides the music, wonderful trumpet solos that add to the spaghetti ambiance. This is a good one, and fans of the genre will be in pasta heaven.",1
5,"Was very fond of Woody Woodpecker and his cartoons as a child. Still get much enjoyment out of them now as a young adult, even if there are more interesting in personality cartoon characters and better overall cartoons.That is in no way knocking Woody, because many of his cartoons are a lot of fun to watch and more and also still like him a lot as a character. He's fun enough and isn't obnoxious, but this is not the manic Woody of his early cartoons. Like in 'Log Jammed', this is a pretty toned down Woody Woodpecker, he's still fun but one does sort of pine for his original personality which would have contrasted more with Dooley, the funnier and more interesting character.Like in 'Log Jammed', there are a few amusing moments, but the timing lacks zip and the laughs are too far and between. Never rising above amusing. The story is flimsy and at times repetitive, too much of the action veers on the obvious.It is the animation that fares least in 'Panhandle Scandal', which was not unexpected. Time and budget constraints shows in some of the animation, which is a little rushed looking in the drawing and detail wise it's on the simplistic and careless side like many of Woody's cartoons from this period continuing through to the 60s.On the other hand, the music however is bouncy, energetic and very lushly orchestrated, not only synchronising and fitting with the action very well but enhancing it.Some of the cartoon is amusing and the ending is a pretty nice if not exactly surprising (one does have a pretty good suspicion) touch, though Dooley repeating ""I don't know him, Senor"" didn't make anywhere as much sense when first appearing early in the cartoon.Voice acting is solid, with Grace Stafford continuing to prove why she was the best voice actor for the character and the one that understood him the most.On the whole, not a bad cartoon but there isn't really the desire to see it again. 5/10 Bethany Cox",-1
7,"Moody was a player on the fringe of Hollywood and worked with Shlockmeisters like Coleman Franis and Ray Dennis Steckler. This documetary features Franis( just sort of walking though one scene) and the great Bruno Ve Sota, looking really bad in an pointless, terrible vinette. So grade Z cinema freaks have those reasons for checking in out.Beyond that, it is an oddly irritating look at the history of the American Hobo. Though real hobos are interviewed, most of vinettes are clearly staged. The whole film, which took years to put together(give Moody points for tenacity) is clearly overdubbed and it's hard to tell if anyone is speaking in there real voices.Still, some details are  effecting, like two boys jeering at a Hobo who lives in underground caves. Allthough poorly acting, this scene tells us a sad truth about human cruelty. Moody, who narrates, finally takes us to the National Hobo convention in Iowa. The other films big problem is the surprisingly horrible score, shlocky songs that sort of immatate the folk songs of the road.",1

10,I love Empire. I love how ridiculous it is and how exaggerated the characters are. But they did something that I didn't see coming. Great twist at the end.,1
10,"I wasn't very enthused when I first heard of Empire, though I am a big fan of the movie Hustle & Flow. Taraji Henson and Terrence Howard have such amazing chemistry on screen. I have become a huge fan of Empire and the show has actually gotten even better this season. I love the Lyons when they come together to fight a external threat, and this season has got progressively better as it has progressed to the point that I am on pins and needles waiting for the next episode. Speaking of which, THIS episode was a wonderfully done one. It had all of the drama and suspense and absolutely NONE of it was out of place or over the top. I simply cannot wait until the next episode, and if you have not given this show a chance, you are missing out ENTIRELY.Side note: That remix of the song Jamal and Warren did is FIRE!",1
4,"I was apprehensive as it was a Sci-Fi Channel movie, which often means cheapness and bad writing and acting. But actually, for one it is actually not too bad, not good by all means but unlike others it does have redeeming qualities. The Van Helsing-prologue is rather brief but sets the tone well, the score is reasonably atmospheric, the Romanian locations are simply gorgeous and with references to past horror films(Ghost of Frankenstein, Nosferatu) and Vampire lore there is some evidence that some research was done. Some have said the acting was better than average, some have said it was really bad. I'd say it was a mixed bag. I found Michael Parre and Sandra Hess likable leads, and Tim Abell was fun as Lex, but the best was Fintan McKeown in the most sympathetic role of the film and he does well with it. However, there are some let downs, I never did find the priest character believable for a second, the (beautiful) female scientist likewise, and the teacher was annoying and does some unbelievably stupid things. Here come the bad things about Gargoyle's Revenge however. The gargoyle(s) are much too fake, the haphazard camera work completely betrays this, and they don't come across as menacing or interesting. The murders are poorly done also, again the camera work dilutes the sense of terror the scenes should do, if not enough to clearly see how artificial the decapitations, mutilations and gore look. The script is cheesy and very unnatural and aimless in its flow and structure. The story was decent in idea but falls short in execution, a couple of intriguing scenes like the prologue and the ferris wheel, but the murders and the contrived ending aren't so good, a lot of the telling is dull and predictable and overall Gargoyle's Revenge could have done with much more atmosphere. The action scenes are repetitive, while the characters are not just clichéd but either underdeveloped(the female scientist), annoying(the teacher) or both(the priest), only Father Soren properly doesn't suffer from either. Overall, not good but not terrible either. 4/10 Bethany Cox",-1
5,"Two CIA agents are sent to Bucharest, Romania to solve a high profile kidnapping. But what they discover is something inexplicable. An evil gargoyle, once thought dead and banished forever, has returned with a vengeance.I do love the use of stock footage from the Jean-Claude Van Damme film ""Maximum Risk"" (1996) to make the car chase and explosions more exciting. Nice use of the budget, Jim! And actually, when compared to the work Wynorski does today (2012), this is not actually that bad. Not nearly as good as his 1980s work, but not terrible. This must have been about the point where he took a sharp turn downward.",-1
5,"Bleak but well-intended video horror set in Romania (there's always a sinister story to tell there) and focusing on an ancient type of Catholic demons. The Gargoyles, humanoid monsters with bat DNA, were extinct for almost 500 years but now they're breeding like bunnies again in the catacombs underneath an old Romanian cemetery. A couple of CIA-agents, who're in the country for an American kidnapping-case, go after them. There's not much originality in the script and the poor computer-engineered monster effects fail to impress as well. Still, this is a moderately entertaining B-movie with enthusiastic acting performances and some cheesy dialogue (""It's ALWAYS better to rule in hell than to serve in heaven""). There's a semi-ingenious twist near the end and the gargoyles' breeding process is a clean ""Alien"" rip-off. Naturally, you can't expect too much from this type of cheap film-making.",-1
5,"Underneath a Romanian Catholic church's graveyard lies a breeding ground of eggs containing gargoyles an evil priest is harvesting for Armegeddon as the mother creature is out flying the skies looking for victims to munch on. Michael Paré and Sandra Hess are American agents working on a case regarding a criminal who was snatched away by the mother gargoyle monster, trying to determine what had caused his death, among a string of attacks concerning the beast. Kate Orsini is an art curator helping to restore and modernize the Catholic church where creepy corrupt priest Fintan McKeown is secretly working against his clergy hoping to unleash an army of hatched gargoyles on an unsuspecting public. Petri Roega is a priest sent by the Vatican to replace McKeown and indeed knows what his plans are. Paré will hook up with Orsini after reporting to her after learning about her missing co-workers..in their search for truth regarding bizarre crime scenes and elaborate pictures of gargoyles found in a book of study on McKeown's desk(..not to mention Orsini's discovery of a missing painting hidden in the Catholic church she is working on containing a gargoyle)they will soon learn about a special crossbow and blood-blessed arrows meant to use on the mother gargoyle sweeping down and snatching human food. Tim Abell, a Wynorski regular, has a supporting role as Lex, a showman who passes himself off as a cult leader of vampirism finding a devoted following of goth-obsessed flunkies who frequent his club for kicks. Abell sees himself what the gargoyle can do when it swoops down taking out a gang of thugs who wish to take over Bucharest's streets. Another Wynorski regular Arthur Roberts has a small role as a Bishop who lives within the ruins of a castle on the outskirts of Bucharest who holds the special crossbow and gives knowledge to Paré and Orsini regarding the gargoyle on the loose.Serious creature feature from Wynorski plays it completely straight unlike his usual efforts, certainly relies heavily on computer generated monsters which look more like giant bats when cloaked in the darkness of night or within the catacombs underneath the graveyard. Wynorski does, when given a chance, direct films geared towards fans of sci-fi/horror/action, but rarely has sufficient funds to finance a feature with superior special effects. When the gargoyle charges towards the camera, that's when the computer generated effects are truly exposed. Wynorski actually focuses more on plot than usual with a cast keeping a straight face with Paré coasting on his charisma. I think fans of Sci-fi channel monster movies will find this better than most of their usual fare, but I'm not sure that's an insult or a compliment for Wynorski's movie. I love gargoyles, but even the finest CGI monster would pale in comparison to the animatronic wonders created by the ingenuity and artistic skill of the crew for the ""Lover's Vow"" tale in Tales from the Darkside-The Movie(1990). Like other directors who wish not to give their correct name in the directorial credit, Wynorski uses the alias of Jay Andrews. The movie doesn't really separate itself from the gluttony of monster movies that have populated Sci-fi channel over the years so don't expect any really big surprises.",-1
3,"Gargoyle starts late one night in 'Romania 1532' as a peasant girl (Daniela Nane) travels along in her horse & cart minding her own business when from the moonlit clouds above a living Gargoyle swoops down & attacks her, she manages to escape the Gargoyle & happens upon a castle of some description where an angry mob of local villagers & a Priest are able to put an end to the Gargoyle, or so they think... Cut to present day Bucharest where two CIA agents Ty Griffin (Michael Pare) & Jennifer Wells (Sandra Hess) are about to negotiate the safe return of the son of a rich American ambassador from his kidnappers. In pursuit of one of the kidnappers Griffin loses him on the roof of a building but finds a large pool of blood & no visible signs of what happened to him. Meanwhile Dr. Christina Durant (Kate Orsini) & her colleague Richard Barrier (Jason Rohrer) are renovating a church when the church labourer Gregor (Mihai Bisericanu) informs Richard that he has found some ancient relic, the two investigate & find a cave with lots of slimy cocoons & one very angry & very much alive Gargoyle who wastes no time in killing them both. Griffin & Wells are on the case when they are reported missing & soon realise that local legends of monstrous Gargoyles are true with a local priest named Father Soren (Fintan McKeown) planning to flood the world with them...Co-written, co-produced & directed by Jim Wynorski under his usual pseudonym Jay Andrews Gargoyles is yet another masterpiece Wynorski can add to his credits, not. The script by Wynorski, Ion Ionescu, A.G. Lawrence & Bill Munroe is crap, is unexciting, dull & is as simplistic as you can get. For a start I would like to know if there was only one Gargoyle left who laid all those eggs because I'm pretty sure it couldn't have made itself pregnant. How did it survive in that hole for 500 years? What did it eat? How did the priest know it was there? Why has no one else ever figured it out? Why did the priest want to flood the world with them? To rule it? The Gargoyles are hardly going to take over the world & then let some priest just rule it like a king & if they did what would be left to rule? Much like the guys who wrote Gargoyle I don't think he thought it through that well did he? Whichever way I look at it, whichever way I approach it, from whichever angle I try to figure it out from, no matter how many times I try to square the circle Gargoyles just doesn't make any sense & they story has huge plot holes, lapses in logic & isn't that great to start with anyway. The character's are dull & clichéd, the action repetitive & unexciting while the film as a whole is a real bore to sit through. People do illogical things & everything that happens is far to convenient like when the priest is try to convince Griffin that Gargoyle's exist & one just suddenly shows up & attacks them. The cave full of cocoons is such a rip-off of Aliens (1986) it's embarrassing & the ending was lame. The bit on the large Ferris Wheel at the fair was funny though when the guy mocked the boys fear of heights & forced him to get on it.Director Wynorski cuts costs & steals footage from other films, in fact the best scene from Gargoyle is a car chase through Bucharest but it was taken from the Jean-Claude Van Damme action film Maximum Risk (1996). There are no shocks, scares or atmosphere. The special effects are terrible, the CGI Gargoyle looks like it belongs in a computer game & has little interaction with any living cast members, there are lots of scenes of people looking up to the sky & trying to appear scarred. There isn't even any worthwhile gore to make the thing watchable, there is one awful decapitation & that's it.Technically the special effects are awful but otherwise it's passable, the Romanian locations look suitably Romanian. Gargoyle went straight-to-video & it shows with a pretty cheap look & feel to it. The acting isn't up to much, personality bypass victim Michael Pare makes for the dullest of dull heroes.Gargoyle is a crap film, it fails at everything a decent creature feature should strive to achieve. A total waste of 90 minutes as far as I'm concerned, one to avoid.",-1
5,"This is a cheap and cheerful monster movie - you know that going in.And given where it's pitched, it's not too bad. It is, of course, full of the usually idiotic nonsense - cops/agents who empty a magazine into a creature and, having noted that there is no effect whatsoever, decide that the best thing to do (obviously) is empty another magazine. And another. And another. Then you've got the priest who, you just know, must be batting for the other side. Then you've got...Clichés. But you were expecting them, weren't you? The two agents, straightforward X-Files clones, are both somewhat wooden, which is a shame, because most of the rest of the cast isn't bad.The effects themselves are much better than cheap and cheerful CGI often is.This movie gets a resounding ""could be much worse"" and if that comes across as damning with faint praise then that's unfortunate, because the film is better than that.",-1
7,"While on assignment in Romania, CIA agents attempting to solve a rash of strange disappearances finds them to be the cause of an escaped, legendary gargoyle loosened upon the countryside in modern times and must try to stop the creatures' rampage.This one here proved to be a highly-enjoyable creature feature. One of the main parts about this one is the enjoyable action quotient that runs throughout her, which comes along through several rather enjoyable parts incorporated in this one. The biggest inclusion here is the traditional action elements featured within this one, as the opening abduction sequences features plenty to like here with the initial gunplay serving as the springboard for the rather fun car chase through the city that includes the requisite crashing into each other, explosions and maneuvering through tight spaces that it feels quite in line with the standards of the genre, while a later gunfight between rival gangs on a rooftop is a great piece before including the creature attacking leading to a three-way fight between the two holding off the creature which is really fun and a later sequence where it chases them down through the winding mountain road while it tries to get the special weapon in their possession. Still, as much fun as this is the creature action is where the film really shines as there's plenty of confrontations with the creature which leads to attacks like the opening village sequence where they trap the creature underground, the first attack where it's released from the tunnels, the rather chilling scenes of it rampaging across the city as the attack on the photographer in the zoo or the ferris wheel ambush in front of the traumatized child while the attack on the church high on the hillside makes for a rather enjoyable series of action-packed encounters. In addition, the finale here is quite fun with the commandos venturing into the catacombs beneath the church where it has a nursery set-up which makes for a really cheesy time as they battle the infants flying around leading to some grand firefights as they swarm over them in some really nice deaths and leading to the final confrontation with the creature out in the woods for an enjoyable enough finale. Along with the fine-looking creature and cheesy bloody kills, these here give this one a lot of rather good parts to like over the flaws. The main flaw here is the fact that the film's storyline here with the one priest involved in aiding the creatures really makes no sense and doesn't have any real motivation for helping them, due to the rather inane need for a priest to want to assist them at all. It's a pretty complex and confusing reason as for why this occurs and his response is too utterly clichéd and hackneyed apocalypse reasoning that really doesn't help make it any clearer at all. On top of that, the film's rather cheesy and goofy nature on display, as the low- budget nature of this is featured throughout here not only with the typically atrocious CGI that's quite cheap and low-rent while rarely displaying any kind of realistic semblance at all, while others include the creature's origin story and the scattershot story that goes off into all sorts of tangents without rhyme or reason which makes for a really jarring effort at times. This here is all that really holds it back.Rated R: Graphic Language and Graphic Violence.",1
7,"Released in 2004, ""Gargoyle: Wings of Darkness"" (also known as ""Gargoyle"" and ""Gargoyle's Revenge"") is a low budget made-for-TV creature feature about the invasion of gargoyles in modern Romania. It's Grade B all the way and I'm going to review it as such. As far as I know 1972's ""Gargoyles"" was the first film on the subject and was also made-for-TV. That film dealt with the rebirth and invasion of gargoyles in the American Southwest and starred Cornel Wilde, Jennifer Salt and Scott Glenn. If you've never seen it be sure to check it out because it's a minor masterpiece for what it is and proves that you don't have to have a huge budget to make a good movie. ""Gargoyles: Wings of Darkness"" is sort of a sequel in the sense that it shares many of the same elements of ""Gargoyles"" (e.g. gargoyle cocoons hatching in a cave, a gargoyle attacking a speeding car by getting on the roof, etc.); the main difference of course is that the invasion takes place in Romania and the gargoyles are all CGI as opposed to stunt people in cool rubber costumes. Is ""Wings of Darkness"" as good as ""Gargoyles""? I'd say no, but it's hard to say for a few reasons. For instance, ""Gargoyles"" was the first of its kind, as far as gargoyles go, and there was nothing else like it in the early 70s; hence, it's easy to view it favorably with nostalgia-tinged glasses. ""Wings of Darkness"" came out 32 years later amidst a glut of low-budget creature features, including many with winged monsters like the two ""Jeepers Creepers"" flicks, not to mention later films like ""Wyvern"" (2009) and ""Roadkill"" (2011), which are both well done. What if ""Wings of Darkness"" came out in '72 and was the first flick of its kind? I'm sure it'd be regarded more highly. Okay, why am I giving ""Wings of Darkness"" a 7/10 Star rating? Because it's good for what it is and tries hard to entertain. For one thing, many scenes are reminiscent of the Hammer films of the 60s and early 70s; needless to say, if you like Hammer you'll probably appreciate this flick. But what do I mean by ""tries hard to entertain""? I mean that director/co-writer Jim Wynorski throws everything in but the kitchen sink in an effort to entertain the viewer; there are so many crazy ideas and subplots thrown in that it's almost impossible to get bored during the 87-minute runtime. Here's a list of items: Ancient Gargoyles with offspring being born from ""Alien""-like cocoons. The gargoyles don't look bad for CGI, although to be expected they're kinda cartooney; plus you get quite a few good looks at 'em, including close-ups; there's even a prominent scene where a gargoyle attacks in broad daylight. Authentic Romanian locales with lots of castles, ancient churches, graveyards and mountain vistas. A terrorist kidnapping. A wild shoot-'em-up car chase. Mulder & Scully-like CIA agents (Michael Paré and Sandra Hess) and their investigation into the gar-thing phenomenon. A ""cool"" drug-lord and his sinister nightclub. A satanic ritual with quasi-altar sacrifice and requisite scantily-clad wenches. Rival drug gangs. Dracula's castle (actually Vlad the Impaler). Another wild car chase; this time with a winged gargoyle along a spectacular mountainside road.Other than Sandra Hess, a stunning brunette leading lady, Dr. Christina Durant (Kate Orsini). In fact, the film's full of incredibly gorgeous women, like Hammer. How can all this stuff possibly gel together in a coherent story? I don't know but it's not bad for a low-budget TV monster flick. On the downside, some of the acting/dialogue is kinda wooden or unconvincing as if the actors first read the script that morning, but that's to be expected in this type of Grade-B creature-on-the-loose movie; it's not ""Apocalypse Now"" after all. Also, at one point the movie mixes-up gargoyles with dragons, which is strange since they're two totally different mythological creatures; although I'm not sure 'gargoyle' can legitimately qualify as a creature since the term is actually a word of French derivation meaning ""water-throat"" referring to ornamental fixtures or grotesques on Gothic era cathedrals who's mouths served as water spouts to facilitate the flow of rain buildup from their roofs. A quick search on Google reveals little as far as supernatural mythology of gargoyles and chimera, the non-functional grotesque variety that were added as pure decorations. Some mention is made of tales regarding the gargoyle forms as guarding their cathedrals during the night in a living form and then returning to their stoned state during the day, but such tales were created after the fact to explain why they were so commonly seen. Humans have always had a ghoulish, darker side and the forms stuck in the popular consciousness. So enterprising 14th century devotees came up with a fanciful explanation for why they were there for young inquisitive minds, perhaps as a put-on to scare kids into finishing their vegetables. There are no tales of gargoyles having banded together with Satan to do his bidding on Earth as depicted in the 1972 film's commanding prologue, and in fact the opposite is actually what is implied since they were guarding churches. If you're into gargoyles, Hammer Films or creature features in general you should check this one out. Like I said, it tries hard to entertain despite the low budget. It's at least an enjoyable guilty pleasure.GRADE: B",1
5,"I was surprised by this work. Although told poorly, this video venture features an intriguing, well-developed story. Quite frankly, the film quality was poor; the CGI was choppy and ineffectual; the dialog ranged from campy to crappy; the performances were cute but inexperienced; and what was supposed to be witty repartee between the two CIA agents came off as glib and overdone.So why watch this? Purely for the story. It draws you in and wraps you up in its membranous gargoyle wings. It entertains. It amuses. It tries, without trying too hard, or ever taking itself too seriously, which enables you to find the humor in it without feeling the need to laugh at it, and allows you to enjoy it without feeling the compunction to add it to your ""guilty pleasures"" category.All in all, we had fun with it, though it is NOT a Friday/Saturday night movie. Watch it when it rains and all is dark.It rates an 8.2/10 on the B scale, which is somewhere around a 5.4/10 on the A scale, from...the Fiend :.",-1
8,"After a brief Van Helsing-styled prologue establishing gargoyles in historical Romania and implying that they've been trapped under the ground, Gargoyle: Wings of Darkness (the title given by the film as well as the video box) takes us to modern day Romania, where Ty Griffin (Michael Paré) and Jennifer Wells (Sandra Hess) are working on the kidnapping of a public official's son. While chasing the kidnappers, Ty discovers that one has suddenly disappeared--only valuable cargo and a large bloodstain remain. Meanwhile, two archaeologists/historians, Christina Durant (Kate Orsini) and Richard Barrier (Jason Rohrer) are working in a church that we realize has a connection with the prologue. How will they all tie together, and what will they do if a gargoyle is on the loose again? Although Gargoyle is a bit awkward in a couple spots--the pacing isn't quite as smooth as it could be--I really enjoyed the film. Director/co-writer Jim Wynorski has a long history making campy, low-budget exploitation horror films (which is a positive in my eyes) and his experience shows. Gargoyle looks much more high-budget and ""high-class"" than a lot of his other work, but it still retains a sense of fun, freshness and finely honed craft that comes from being a veteran.So imagine my surprise when I check out the other reviews on IMDb and see that to date, the film is almost universally loathed. While reading through most of the other comments, I couldn't help feeling that the majority of them were simply ridiculous. While I can see many filmgoers not pronouncing Gargoyle a masterpiece, I can't see giving this film a failing grade. Like usual, it was clear that the reviewers who hated the film must have had bizarre expectations.Despite the detective/crime/action elements that are prominent in the scene immediately following the prologue (and which were handled brilliantly in my view), Gargoyle is at its heart a monster flick, and a fairly traditional one at that. Surprisingly, a number of people commented on various facets of Gargoyle seeming implausible. Monster films are a subgenre of horror, and horror is really ""dark fantasy"", or ""dark fairy tales"" (there are some difficult cases for that description, such as serial killer biopics, but ""dark fantasy"" works for most of the genre). Thus, Gargoyle is not a documentary. So it really doesn't matter if, for example, gargoyles were unheard of in Romania until recently. It doesn't matter if the CIA doesn't do the work they're shown doing here. You should expect Gargoyle to be implausible--hopefully, you don't believe that giant flying gargoyles are real or believable; when that's the premise, it's not the filmmaker's fault if you expect but do not get plausibility.At that, the film references a number of historical facts. Wynorski and his cohorts actually did a fair amount of research for the film. For example, they talk about the historical Dracula, Vlad Tepes, and contextualize the ""reality"" versus the myths that were built up around him. They actually went to the trouble of finding a property that looks remarkably similar to the famous 19th Century pencil sketch of the ruins of Castle Dracula (you can see it Chapter 6 of Raymond T. McNally and Radu Florescu's book, In Search of Dracula). They also insert a number of clever references to past horror films. One of the principal homes of villainy in the film is named Castle Orlok, which comes from Graf Orlok, the name of the Dracula character is F.W. Murnau's 1922 classic, Nosferatu. There is a reference to Vasaria, the village introduced in Ghost of Frankenstein (1942). There are obvious visual references to the Alien films. They also reference real-life horror culture, such as ""vampire clubs"".Other reviewers complained about the special effects. CGI is the only means available to produce this kind of film at this kind of budget. Yes, the cgi in the film looks ""fake"". Again, hopefully no one would think that a huge flying gargoyle would look real, anyway. It's a fantasy token. You have to use your imagination when watching fantasy. Mechanicals/animatronics of flying gargoyles would have looked ""fake"" too, and would have raised the budget to 100 million. One person commented that the cgi appears as if Wynorski's crew had been trying to capture the look of Ray Harryhausen claymation ala the Sinbad films, and another said that the effects had a 1950s flavor. Believe it or not, a lot of us love Harryhausen's work and monster flicks from the 1950s; so if the cgi has that look, we think it's a good thing. As for the look of the blood and ""gore"" effects, I thought they were well done. They were stylized and artistic. I like that. To repeat, the film is not a documentary; the blood and gore do not have to look like crime scene photos to be good.Others complained about the performances. The dialogue and acting seemed more than fine to me. I'm not sure what anyone would find unsatisfactory there. The film is a bit campy, but intentionally so--remember Wynorski's roots, after all, and camp is not at all unprecedented for a monster flick. If you like monster flicks, you probably have a fair taste for camp. The one thing that I do agree with most reviewers about is the comment regarding the female cast members--they are all exceptionally, enchantingly beautiful. So even if you don't like the performances, there is plenty of eye candy when it comes to the cast as long as you're attracted to women.Gargoyle had a remarkably modern feel to me. To a large extent, it actually reminded me of ""Special Unit 2"" (2001) an unfortunately short-lived, campy horror television show that was also unjustly slammed by some critics. It's extremely important to have appropriate expectations when watching a film like Gargoyle. As long as you like the genre and the tone, you should find the film sufficiently entertaining.",1
5,"I'll say it right away: I'm a sucker for monster movies. Also for the bad ones. Yes, even the really bad ones. And technically and theoretically ""Gargoyle"" is a bad one. No doubt about that. Hey, Jim Wynorski directed this one, so what can one expect, right? But I've started to like this guy a lot over the recent years. He made great campy horror-flicks during the 80's (""Chopping Mall"", ""Return of the Swamp Thing""), and during these last years I saw some of his newer, nonsensical monster movies. And I had loads of fun with them. Great thing with his newer monster-flicks, is that he puts so many crazy ideas and subplots in them, that you never get bored. Okay, most of the time it doesn't lead to anything, but it's still fun. Plus, he often even rips-off various plot elements or characters from his own movies, to re-use them in new flicks of his. These are the mysterious Ways of Wynorski. Anyway, here we got: Ancient Gargoyles with their offspring being born from ""Alien""-like cocoons, a Roumanian setting with lots of castles, two CIA detectives investigating the strange goings-on and mutilated bodies, a terrorist-kidnapping, a drug-lord running a sinister voodoo-nightclub, rival drug-dealers, a Dracula-worshiping cult (mentioned only), two competitive priests (of which one has a secret agenda), a gorgeous-looking cutie with a degree in history/folklore/archeology (or something), Michael Paré, a spectacular car-chase with continuity errors, Michael Paré cranking up a smile at the end while laughing at a joke, one final ""this ain't over""-shot. And some other things. So how can you not have fun with it? The CGI used for the gargoyle is surprisingly tolerable and even reminded me at times of those good old stop-motion effects back in the old days. Thinking about it, this film is a far better movie then, for example, ""Pterodactyl"" (2005) - another one of those flying CGI beasts of terror movies - because in ""Gargoyle"" at least there's an attempt at a story. Hell, put ""Gargoyles"" next to the recent, utterly abominable ""Harpies"" (2007), and you'll see ""Gargoyles"" for the genuine Wynorski Masterpiece that it is. Of course it's complete nonsense. But it's Wynorski-nonsense, and that's about the same as pure fried gold.",-1
5,"Some CIA types travel to Romania to look into a kidnapping. What they find is an ancient evil reborn, in the form of a gargoyle. Not a bad plot, and the movie starts out with a sense of mystery and dread even though we know this resurrected gargoyle is the real culprit. Michael Pare is the lead, and he is as wooden as ever. The gargoyle itself is pretty effective, better than a lot of other CGI creations. The Romanian backdrops are used to decent effect, but in the end the movie proves yet another Sci-Fi Channel dog. There is a gargoyle movie from the 1960s or early '70s with Cornel Wilde that puts this baby to shame, even with far less sophisticated special effects (the gargoyle is a man in a rubber suit, for instance).",-1
7,"This is yet another Gutter grade ""B"" movie, exactly the type I like.The CGI is a bit better then average for this style of campy low budget movie, and certainly watchable. The gore is minimal but effective. This movie has a real great car chase in the opening 15 min, and the Church sets are mouth dropping beautiful,Romania must be a beautiful place.Michel pare is a bit wooden in this but watchable (I always thought we would make it into the big league...oh well). The rest of the cast are watchable and capable actors, the dialog can be a bit stiff, but who cares? The story was fun and pretty fast paced.The action good, and the gargoyles, for the budget just fine.Worth a watch.",1
3,"You know that mouthwash commercial where the guy has a mouth full of Listerine or whatever it is and he's trying really hard to keep from spitting it up into the sink? That's a great metaphor for this movie. I kept watching, even though it was really difficult. But keeping mouthwash in your mouth will leave you with a minty fresh feeling. This movie left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I should have spit it out when I had the chance.The premise is corny enough to be fun. For the first time in like a thousand years, Gargoyles have returned to Romania, and all of the priests who knew how to fight and kill these things are long dead. It's up to Michael Pare and some other secret agents to get to the bottom of things before the Gargoyles run amok. Unfortunately, the premise is completely lost in bad dialog and less than enthusiastic acting on the part of the human leads. The best acting is done by the CG Gargoyles.In the end, this movie feels like a poor man's Van Helsing. If you check your brain at the door, this might get you through a dreary Monday night. I gave it 3 out of 10 stars.",-1
6,this movie is perfect for a Sunday afternoon watching with the kids and maybe grandpa that only like his reruns of GUNSMOKE.I found the film to be a low budget SYFY flick that had a damn good cinematographer.All films cant tear up 20 brand new cars in a chase scene like in bad boys one and bad boys two.i've noticed in these reviews to take them with a grain of salt.Especially when being graded by an American audience.So to wind up my little Opinion of a group of artist hard work. I say it's a fun flick not a American blockbuster like UNDERWORLD OR PROMETHEUS IT'S JUST A STORY WITH A MONSTER RIPPED OFF FROM JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS.,1
6,"One does not have to watch an incredible amount of creature features to realize that the majority of them is virtually the same, dividable into a few major categories. I don't have those lined out, but GARGOYLE(billed over here as Revenge of the Gargoyle) clearly falls under the Mythology & Conspiracy In Order to Protect the World categories, an approach to the monster flick which I'm particularly fond of. Dropping into the movie during a chase and a subsequent killing, it looked like the climax. Luckily i didn't run into anything more than another piece of formula: have a cop chase a criminal with climbing skills and have the monster kill the latter to warm up the audience. That apart, it's still a decent piece of direct-to-video SF. In practical terms, an 'OK way to kill 90 minutes"".THE GOOD That apart, it's still a decent piece of direct-to-video SF. The CGI is good, although naturally more convincing when combined with darkness & fog than when chasing a car in broad daylight. As a matter of fact that scene took away a lot of the creature's charisma. The acting is good enough, with 'Father Soren' standing out as the second most important character, namely the Sympathetic Conspirator, who knows precisely what's behind a series of mysterious murders, has the means to bring them to an end and is willing to collaborate with the Hero, an outsider which is distrusted by the other conspirators. 'Lex' was also entertaining: pity he didn't get a bigger part... As for as a climax is concerned, this movie has both an assassination squad with large guns & a crossbow! Finally, the Romanian settings are gorgeous. THE BAD The murders simply suck, limited to swift snappings of the victims (with a horribly fake decapitation & a bucket of tomato blood ) and mutilated dummies. - 'Soren' turning into the bad guy in order to release hell on Earth didn't work no more than that blatant Alien rip-off of a breeding chamber. Releasing a cloud of gargoyles'd have been more interesting anyway. THE UGLY That stupid progressive priest. He turned out to play his part in the story twist but he didn't come off as a believable clergyman for a second nevertheless. Check Cage in the LA Convention Center in FACE OFF. - That stupid teacher. He should've been drained & ripped on screen.",1
1,"This is just one of the hundred million movies where the directors try to shove too much drama into a movie that's not dramatic at all. Like in the beginning, the part where the monk dude shoved the arrow into his own hand, then shot that same arrow into the gargoyle five minutes later--no sense whatsoever.The only thing worse than the plot line is the CGI, which would be greatly rivaled by a homemade flash movie. The actors look like they're doing their hardest to portray a bunch of 70's robots; the dialogue makes so little sense it's not funny.Many things just HAPPEN with no explanation as to how or why, such as a lady suddenly wandering around a zoo that had shut down hours ago. And when she sees this THING flying towards her, her first reaction is to take a picture, rather than what she does a full ten minutes later---power-walking (not even running) like her life depended on it--which, obviously, it doesn't.Overall, not recommended. Makes me wish they still did new episodes of MST3K.",-1
4,"As far as low budget monster movies goes, this is right on-par with what you'd expect: mediocre acting, a loosely-constructed fantasy story, and CGI that is obviously not polished or in any way professional looking for the year it was made in. Could have done a lot better than that! It's good for what it is in its budget/class, but on the overall scale of ""worst to best movies I've ever seen"" it definitely doesn't score more than a 4 out of 10. Maybe it's because I've never been one for the mid-20th century type of movie making this resembles; I guess the director's age really shows ;) The biggest minus points in this movie are most definitely the effects, and a story that is simply not believable enough to keep my interest. It lacks suspense, it lacks reason; the choice of background story for the gargoyles is shallow and poorly-researched, as well. The movie has a surprisingly slow pace and is predictable after the opening scene that is obviously there to catch people's attention more than actually providing a good setting for the rest of the movie.",-1
9,"Saw the premier of this movie in Cincinnati last month. Very good movie. Nice plot, good characterization, nicely shot on location. Plum Street Productions is an up and coming company which should have more features coming out. Premier had standing room only in the back during the showing. I would recommend anyone to see this short film and provide additional feedback. Understand that the movie may be entered into some competition and believe that it will perform well. Score of the movie was from local talent and original. Matched the theme of the movie nicely. Wished the film could have been actually longer. Good first film for first time director, Mike Potter.",1
7,"Sven Nykvist directs and shoots a film about a Swedish man in the jungle. He makes his living collecting animals for zoos. When a village is attacked by a rogue gorilla he heads into the bush to kill it.At the same time he is saddled with a female photographer who insists on going along. More documentary then drama this is a beautiful film that shows a side of the African wilderness that is probably all gone now. Certainly animals like the rhinoceros with horns the size of a small car are gone. As a documentary of life in the jungle and its changing nature its a great little film. Clearly the filmmakers are were aware that the world they were filming was changing and they note it in the narration. As a drama the film is pretty standard stuff. its clear that the man and the women will have a romance and all of that. However there really isn't much to the story and the emotional climax of the film isn't really the gorilla hunt, which ends with a ""thats it?"" moment, rather its an elephant stampede just before it. Flaws of the drama aside this is quite simply one of the better African lensed films I've seen. Certainly its one of the better documentaries of the period(which predates the Mondo Cane style shock films by a couple of years). I really liked this film. If you take it as a drama its 6 out of 10. As a documentary its 7 out of ten.",1
9,"This was a spectacularly impressing film for its amazing animal shots, actually catching life in the deepest jungles of the Congo 60 years ago in the 1950s. The photo is by Ingmar Bergman's favourite photographer Sven Nykvist and brags all the way of splendid professionalism. The story is rather banal but nevertheless well told, an established Belgian hunter having trouble with a Swedish tourist imposing on him with her total ignorance of the jungle, and with a gorilla harassing a village and killing villagers. This is the first Swedish colour film, and it's amazingly well made under evidently extremely primitive circumstances. The main asset of the film is not the story or the players but the splendid photography of the animals, especially elephants but also crocodiles, giraffes, okapis and the gorilla himself, towering in terror like almost a mythical figure of mystery, the film building up to a nerve-racking finale of the difficult gorilla hunt. Also the psychology of this lonesome gorilla and his predicament is very well unveiled. It''s a film on the level with the Swedish master of nature films at the time, Arne Sucksdorff, who almost simultaneously filmed in colour in India from the deep forests there, but with natives only. Here the beautiful Gio Petré as the blonde tourist in shorts add an extra charm to the jungle adventure and hardships, but I agree with the previous reviewer, that the film is best regarded as almost a documentary. It actually ends by asserting the fact that its story is true.",1
7,"With impressive scenery, close-ups of animals and rich colour photography, Swedish master cinematographer Sven Nykvist directed ""Gorilla"" in cooperation with Lars-Henrik Ottoson and Lorens Marmstedt. Nykvist also acted as Director of Photography with Bengt Lindström, creating some wonderful images of rhinos, anteaters, elephants, crocodiles et cetera. Added to this more or less documentary material is a story about the white hunter and some villagers' fear of an old gorilla male. The film is an interesting depiction of Congo in the 1950's, seen from the white man's perspective.",1
1,"Without a doubt - this had to be one of the worst movies ever made.  Yes, its even worse then ""Manos:  The Hands of Fate!""What pharmaceutical products were they partaking of, when the made this aromatic cinema?Lorne Greene has a bit part in the movie.  Well he has a ""die-through!""  (At least he didn't have to suffer through this tripe!)The only way to see this movie:  LIBERAL USE OF YOUR REMOTE'S FAST FORWARD!The music was bad, the dialogue was worse! (the only memorable line was:  ""A wounded Mercedes - will never be as good as new!"")This movie inflicts enough wounds on the viewers.  I can't really discuss plot - there wasn't much of one to start with.No plot, bad dialogue, crappy acting, boring monotonous scenes (like the will reading) which do NOT advance the plot, or tell us anything about the characters -- are strewn liberally, and it seems systemically through out this film...I didn't know sex could be boring - but if you watch this film without fast forward -- you'll never make it to the end without falling asleep.Good cure for insomnia....YAWN.rated:  NO REELS (pass on this one!)",-1
1,"I really wonder what was going through people's minds when they made this pile of garbage. There is nothing funny about a wife *forcing* her husband to go under the knife. The movie is EXTREMELY insulting and degrading. It's no wonder that Lorne Greene passed away shortly after  this ""movie"" was made. Paul Sorvino should've fired his agent. And it comes to no surprise that the illustrious, distinguished, and prolific director, Paul Burge, also helmed ""Keaton's Cop"". Go figure. Who's REALLY behind this? Planned Parenthood?!Save the money you would've paid to rent this video. It's probably playing on the Lifetime channel right this very moment.",-1
1,"If there was a negative number I would have used that instead. The only reason I saw it was that I worked on that piece of ""YOU KNOW WHAT"". At least it was fun working on the set every day. Paul was a joy to work with and he has a great tenor operatic voice, which he would share with us around his trailer. The other nice part of the work was making suds for Debra Jo Fondren's nude scene. Can you say Playboy TA TA's? I knew you could. Look out for the Harangue Monster, which is a plastic T Rex that we tried to get in the film as many times as possible. Drove the cinematographer nuts. BTW Lorne Green was not the original pick for Paul's business manager. All in all working on it was better than sitting through rushes, but I did get 3 college credits and an eye- full of Debbie Jo's sweater puppies!",-1
1,"Not once was tubal ligation recommended for the wife. It's apparent that this movie is pro vasectomy propaganda. This movie is stupid, brain dead, and unfunny. You have to wonder what motives were for the schmucks that made this ""movie"". If any of you had any sense, you'd skip this trash. The premise is lame. The acting is pathetic. The movie is absolutely not funny. What was the purpose for this trash? ""Let's get men to go out and have vasectomies!"".. What are we dealing with? Feminists? Democrats? The plot is bare thin. There wasn't a laugh in the movie. Paul Sorvino is depressing as the lead. The screenplay is d.o.a. and the wife comes across as a total b.i.t.c.h.",-1
1,"I can't imagine anyone standing in line to buy a ticket for this movie, let alone it being shown theatrically. What the hell was going through the tiny little minds of the producers that made this putrid film? Did they seriously think there would be an audience for this rubbish? Apart from the ""loving"" and ""supportive"" wife (who comes off unsympathetically) insisting that her hubby get ""fixed"", there is some dumb subplot that isn't worth going into detail here, that incidentally takes up more screen time than the titular subject matter (which is so flimsy and inane that it cannot hold up to the full running time). And what also gets me is that no one recommends the wife getting her tubes tied, since she is the one so dead set against having more children. To the husband's defense, I have observed that he is a proud Italian, and the film implies that he is Catholic. Last I heard, the Catholic Church was against any artificial means of birth control. That would/could/should end the argument right away. But never mind, this film has an agenda: to push birth control, namely- male sterilization. Which makes me wonder if Planned Parenthood is behind this film. Nonetheless, this film is insensitive, clumsy, crass, and everything else in between. SKIP IT.",-1
9,"This documentary is about life at Riker's Island, which acts as the local jail for New York City. It consisted of conversations with several former inmates of Riker's Island as they recounted the time they spent there - often years - awaiting trial because they did not have bail money.The things they had to say about other inmates I did not find too surprising - show no weakness, attempts at friendship are probably just attempts to ferret out weakness, show any weakness and other inmates will steal all of your stuff including your food, don't be a deep sleeper and if you don't have a home-made weapon at your ready you are in trouble, always stand up for yourself. One inmate said he joined a prison gang just to survive on the inside.The institution itself was a bit of an education, at least for middle class me. The inmates said the guards were no better than the inmates. They would loose two prisoners who hated each other and take bets on who won the inevitable fight. Guards would let fights in progress finish before they intervened, again betting on the outcome, and if you tried to get a guard in trouble they would put you in solitary. There you are in dim drab surroundings, you get no visits, and you don't get enough food to sustain yourself so you have to save food so when you are really hungry you have something to eat. Apparently these people are not just whining because several multi million dollar settlements have been paid out by NYC on behalf of the treatment of prisoners at Riker's, and all have agreed that Riker's should be divided into five smaller jails dispersed throughout the city.One interesting thing - the inmates who were interviewed were eloquent and insightful, about themselves and the institution, but they all ""fit the narrative"" you might say of people you would expect to get in trouble with the law. They came from broken homes or drug addicted parents, they came from poverty, had little education, and one girl spent three years there because she could not make bail only in the end to be acquitted of all charges. I would say, all fit the narrative but one - There was one woman who was raised middle class, was white, had a bachelor's degree, had a husband and three children, and had a good job with a law firm only to one day decide to help herself to 300,000 dollars from a trust fund. I was interested in her story so I googled her just to see what happened.In 2009 she was working at ANOTHER law firm, this time in Pennsylvania, and AGAIN stole money - this time 100K - partially to pay restitution to the law firm in New York City! Maybe ""ban the box"" is not such a good idea after all! At any rate, this is a very good documentary that largely lets the inmates - and some hidden cameras - speak for themselves. Just don't be expecting an uplifting experience.",1
8,"I was unfamiliar with the type of prison demographics associated with Rikers and was compelled to watch this documentary. My only reference of late was that the IMF Chief, DSK was imprisoned briefly for a rape accusation. Given the potential President of France play, perhaps the US intervened in their election and forced him out of the running? Nah, we would never do something like that, eh?The primary reason for incarceration at Rikers according to this film, is inability to pay Bail. Now how could an IMF Chief be unable to perform this basic fiduciary duty? Also, 97% of the population is either Black or Hispanic. Rather a racy crowd given a high profile elected international position. But I digress.I saw more camaraderie and caring for others in this film than I expected. There was compassion exhibited for other inmates, especially the HIV+ born in jail gentleman as well as other positive emotions portrayed. I have great compassion for those unjustly imprisoned and for those who require mental health care.High recommend for some insight into prison life at a very unique institution. But whatever happened to DSK?????",1
9,"We often think prisons are the worst places that people can end up in our society. However, the stain of criminality and memory will follow these people forever, and those are the greater punishment than a prison sentence. I looked up the white middle aged lady and about her life after prison. Apparently she got a similar paralegal job after prison, which surprised me. Nevertheless, she was caught stealing money again and tried to use some of the stolen money to repay her debt and fines from her last conviction.",1
8,"There is so much one could write, but I would start to sound like Medavoy. Basically, he has to face to men that may be one man and he must decide whether the police should have any involvement. It's a fun episode with future implications.",1
8,"The feelings between Carmela and Furio get stronger. When he goes away with Tony he seems to be angry watching Tony with other women. And there is a moment when he almost does something. But then he just leaves back to Italy without saying good bye. And Paulie is having a very bad time both not being recognized and killing his mom's friend.I have to admit I was a bit bored by the Carmela/Furio story. All those ""affairs"" where nothing is even said is not my thing even though it is kind of original. But I did enjoy the episode. Great acting on both parts. I was actually believing them even though I found the storyline ridiculous.",1
10,"It is an essential characteristic of any respectable gangster epic that one of the main players cheats on the missus. The Sopranos is no exception, with only Bobby Baccala sticking with one woman at a time. The penultimate episode of Season Four, written by the talented Terence Winter, reverses the template by having the frustrated Carmela Soprano fantasizing about another man.The man she pines for is Furio Giunta (Federico Castelluccio), Tony's henchman who moved to Jersey from Naples back in Season 2, and the attraction appears to be mutual. However, Furio has either too much respect for Tony, or too much fear, to the point that he profits from the opportunity to return to Italy for a funeral to seek some interior peace and sound advice on how to behave. Speaking of inner turmoil, Paulie's experiencing one with a vengeance, as he thinks he is an important member of the crew and discovers Carmine doesn't even know who he is, despite his connection with Johnny Sack.Juggling poetry and foul-mouthed comedy, Eloise piles up material for the finale, and the two following seasons, with precise elegance, the belly-laughs of Paulie's misadventure perfectly balancing Carmela's aching heart. The latter subplot is especially poignant as it sets a fundamental point: no matter what you do, if you're a gangster's wife you will always be nothing more than that, meaning you won't get everything you desire. However, Carm has always proved to be her husband's match, so upcoming events are likely to get fiery. Ouch!",1
10,"Carmella is unfairly described by many critics, and yet treated too kindly by others. She is not childish necessarily as much as she is desperate, and either too stupid to realise the implications of her actions for other people (ie Furio and that DIY guy from the previous season) or selfish enough to knowingly bring them into a dangerous situation. You could certainly make the argument that her dissatisfaction is such that she doesn't care much about implications, but I think this is probably something most people deal with. This episode is prime Carmella material and Edie Falco is stellar. Probably one of the best in this season.Side note: I have never seen a hangover represented as well as Gandolfini when does it in one short scene in this episode. I can feel his feelings in this moment.",1
8,"I saw this episode when I was a kid and it took me over 10 years to finally see it in order.
They set up this Carmela - Meadow storyline in the pilot, by the way!",1
8,"Paulie's character is in for quite a surprise and then does something surprising, good drama. John and Tony are interesting as always. Now for the boring: Carmela and her school girl crush and Meadow is as dull as always. If only the Sopranos kids would just disappear!",1
10,"This episode makes way for the following, as the tense relationship between Carmela and Furio comes to an end. The scene where Tony, Furio and Carmela's cousin take the helicopter is magnificent. The loud noise of the helicopter is like a representation of the feelings of Furio toward his boss, when he sees the chance to be next to Carmela, but decides not to take it. When the helicopter flies away, you can see the expression on Furio's face, and that tells you that he has decide to resign to be with the woman she loves.Then, to Carmela. After hearing of Furio's return to Italy, and seeing her daughter so happily in love with her boyfriend, she is devastated. So she engages in a stupid fight with Meadow over Billy Bud, acting like a child. And this continues when the two of them have tea at the room with the Eloise picture, in a great reference to the pilot episode, when Meadow didn't want to go to the Plaza for her birthday tradition. At the end of the episode, Carmela is growing a fever, probably due to the recent events in her life.And the conversation between Tony and Johnny Sack about Carmine is fantastic. ""Yeah, he's healthy. Thank God"". Only a mobster could say that and be thinking of the opposite.",1
9,"I really enjoyed this game back in the day as I was a huge fan of Final Fantasy and anything Squaresoft made for the most part. This game would spawn a sequel; however, as of the time I have written this review, still no third game. A few filler games have been released, but no official third game yet. Of course, this really shows how different Japanese game makers are, as compared to American ones. We try to rush out games every year and build franchises that usually consist of a rehashed game each year, Call of Duty anyone? The Japanese, on the other hand, take it in the completely opposite direction and this series is like an extreme example as it has been 13 years since the second game! Come on now! I prefer Japanese games because of their quality and because they take their time, but this is just ridiculous! Still, this one is still a very fun game as I have revisited it on the PS4, playing the remix. The graphics are a bit up to date; however, still are PS2 graphics. Which is fine by me, honestly, I like game play as opposed to seeing a super detailed world. Here we get several different worlds to traverse, some variations of game play and so on, thus being a very good example of a fun game during a time role playing games were in kind of their high point. The story has a boy named Sora who lives on an island with his childhood friends Riku and Kairi. One day, though, strange dark beings appear and Sora finds himself taken from his home. Meanwhile, Donald and Goofy are charged with finding the person who wields the Keyblade. They end up in place called Traverse Town and join up with Sora who now is in possession of the Keyblade. They must go to many different worlds and seal the keyhole in each world to try and stop the spread of darkness which is threatening to engulf all worlds. A few Disney villains led by Maleficent have plans to use the dark beings known as the Heartless for their own purposes. Thankfully, many Disney heroes and a few Final Fantasy ones will help Sora, Donald and Goofy on their journey which spans several worlds. The game play is that of an action role playing game. You are doing real time combat and fighting a lot, but you visit towns here and there and try to find items and such. I almost think the game play is harder in the PS4 version as I was having a difficult time with it and I don't remember it being that hard back in the day. I loved the whole finding dalmatians quest and finding the trinity marks throughout the game. I also like the very varied amount of levels; however, some of them are so strangely connected you can get quite lost even though no level is all that long. The story is pretty good, but while Maleficent's motives are quite clear, the main antagnoist's is a bit vague. Overall, I found this game really good. I would like the motives of the main villain a bit more clear and while I enjoyed the interjection of the Final Fantasy heroes, other than one villain from the FF universe who is not integral to the plot there is a lack of FF villains. It would have been cool to see a bad guy who was important to the plot and not just an optional boss. This is more of a Disney game so I understand it is not about the FF characters and they are basically cameos, but come on, just one villain within the ranks of the Disney villains? So this game was great, going to revisit the second game too, but who knows if I will ever see a third game. Not sure if the fact that they became Square Enix has anything to do with the fact they have yet to deliver a third game, but even when they do, I do not expect too many FF characters from the games that have come out since this one as there have not been all that many memorable ones.",1
9,"For years and years in all my 24 year old life, I never came across nor have i ever heard of Kingdom hearts until recent years (Akidearest went to a Kingdom Hearts 3 exhibition in Japan recently) and never got to check out until watching the whole walkthrough on YouTube on St Patrick's day this year. Yes I bet Kingdom Hearts fans feel like they wanna throw rocks or even worse things at me and yeah, definitely shame on me bro lol.Anyways in all honesty, it captured my heart folks. I couldn't believe Haley Joel Osment played Sora and the fact my childhood Disney heroes were part of this series also. Now I'm very iffy with Disney remaking originals into real life action films because they honestly lack of new creativity in making new films. However, this time they did it quite right because they used the same designs for the characters by involving no remake design bs. Also the English voice actors as well as Osment did such a great job. You would notice that the Genie and Jafar were voiced by different people (no Williams and Freeman ) but they still did a great job (a lot better then Will Smith and Marwan Kenzari, no offense).Loved the music, love the characters, love how Disney and Square Enix teamed up together for this wonderful series to come to light when I was around 7 years old and didn't realise it. An absolute gem even if I didn't play it lol!",1
10,"This video game will always remain a masterpiece in my mind. Nobody was quite sure what to make of it at the time - a Disney and Final Fantasy crossover featuring a spiky haired young boy who swings around a giant key? Well, it somehow made it work! Everything about this game - the world, story, battles and more - all contribute to a perfect experience. The only thing I didn't like was the battle menu interface and the camera but these were minor.",1
9,"I first played this game when I rented it from the local video rental back in 2003, when I was nine years old. I loved it so much that I received it for Christmas and became utterly addicted. To this day, the original Kingdom Hearts remains one of my favorite video games of all time.The sequels aren't bad, but for me nothing can replicate the warmth, charm, and simplicity to be found in the first game. It seems the first KH was the only game that managed the perfect balance between the Disney and Final Fantasy elements. Nowadays, it seems like both of them are window dressing with little relation to the overarching plot. KH's story is quite good, championing themes of friendship and love without feeling cheesy or preachy.The game play is standard button-mashing, but there are tons worlds to explore. The ability system isn't confusing to get a handle on, and the side quests are great and numerous.Is it perfect? No. The camera is wonky, the Gummi Ship levels are rather dull, and the Monstro level is torture with its outright awful level design. Still, none of that takes away from an otherwise excellent game, one that can still please children and adults alike, just as the great Disney films continue to do.",1
1,"If they intend to continue appeasing the console RPG populace with its stories and so on, they need to take this game and remind themselves that THEY can not write, and only through the assistance of others not in Square can they come up with entertainment. The last time Square trusted anyone outside their company to help with their games ended in disaster with Square of America. However, this is only a result of the megalomaniacal grip Square so loves to keep. Now that they've decided to relinquish that grip, and welcoming the idea of partnership with another company, perhaps in the coming future Square can come up with better games.Onto the game itself... Kingdom Hearts, although it's nothing new (we're taking Disney characters everyone and their brother recognizes combined with certain Final Fantasy characters only fans will know of) is kind of fun but easily forgettable. It's definitely not the grandiose self-important stuff Square shells out prolificly since SNES but it's okay. You play a character drummed up by Square who finds himself in an alien world (Disney) where he has to go through a myriad of quests to find Mickey for example, while aided by characters from both Disney and Final Fantasy. It's an okay RPG, and worth a rent.",-1
10,"This is a game that you wouldn't really have much expectations for, when it was first announced every one I talked to was saying it was going to be one of the worst games ever because it is a mixture of Final Fantasy and Disney, and who can blame them it sounds completely absurd. However it might of been crazy but it worked. Tetsuya Nomura created one of the best games ever.The game play is wonderful, the characters are lovable, and the story is far from stupid. We start out on an Island called Destiny Islands as a boy named Sora. We meet his friends Kairi and Riku and together they all have a plan to leave the island in search of new worlds. Meanwhile Donald Duck at the Disney Castle finds the King is gone and with the help of Goofy they go out to find the key that the King instructed them to find so they can save their worlds. That is where Sora comes in. When his world is sucked into darkness he escapes to Traverse Town and meets Donald and Goofy then learns the blade he carries is known as the Keyblade a blade that can lock any lock or unlock. So now he goes on many adventures with Donald and Goofy to many Disney worlds to stop the Heartless and to find his friends and stop the darkness that threatens all worlds, and maybe learn who is behind it.The game is filled with great CGI effects, we see all these great battles and are just plainly fun. Anyone who plays this game can tell you that this game is great, you get to fight all these villains Disney and new alike and get to enjoy the story which includes Final Fantasy characters like Leon, Yuffie, Cid, and more. If you get this game then you can have a great time. You will find yourself immersed into a great game with many worlds that bring the story to life, filled with great battle sequences, and loving characters. Kingdom Hearts is one of the best games ever made.",1
9,"Kingdom hearts is one of the most beloved gaming series and had an idea so stupid that it ended up becoming more then what it was. This is a fun JRPG with many good quality's and while I wouldn't call it perfect due to some flaws holding it back. The pros of this game far out weigh the cons. The first thing I love about the game is how it looks, the graphics are great for a 2002 game, it's colourful, bright, has good body animations, and the environments look interesting throughout the game. The music is really good too, the sound effects are solid, the voice acting is great in English having the Disney characters sound like they do in the tv shows/movies since they are the same actors. the square characters sound good too tho a few of them could be a bit better. the games writing is well done tho a bit cheesy sometimes. The storyline is very well done and is the still the best story In the series for me along with birth by sleeps. It's funny, heartfelt, action packed, adventurous, magical, memorable and has good drama. It isn't overly confusing like the latter games are, they are not bad just a bit much to fully grasp for anyone new to the series. The gameplay is fun to. the battle system is really interesting in that it's a hack and slash RPG not turn based. It works well and as you get further into the game you can acquire new abilities to make combat more interesting as the game goes on. The Disney world you explore has new NPC's that have there own ways of helping you. The boss fights are challenging and fun. the controls are good tho it bit iffy with the jumping. The camera is a bit annoying since you hold L2 and R2 to move it. Nowadays you can pick up kingdom hearts 1 on PS3/PS4 where they have made the camera much better. The gummi ship missions are ok but nothing great, Lots of content and a good length for a JRPG. The game is great and is worth owning for not only final fantasy fans but to Disney fans too.",1
10,"Now. Disney as a child was just fantastic. But as a child, I had never played this game. With Disney placing magic memories that I know I will remember for all my life, I thought this was another Final Fantasy. Now I don't like FF. So outdated.I just picked up the 1.5 Remix, and have pretty much completed it already in about a total of 50+ Hours and I will tell you. I wish I played this game. I now await the 2.5 remix of the game, to play KHII.Sora is my favourite character (yeah, big surprise) he relates a lot to me and I really think he's a great protagonist. But in games released AFTER the Kingdom Hearts series, those characters are considered bad. But not in my eyes. A hero needs to be caring, helpful, cunning, cocky, and so on. It's what makes heroes fun.The story is fantastic and really is timeless. Now the flaws: Sometimes it's easy to get lost in the amazing worlds S.E and Disney have crafted.Some Boss battles can be very frustrating as you really have to force tactics upon yourself. But once you get passed them, you feel rewarded. Lack of save points towards the end. Especially when you reach the actual final stage of the game, the save points do lack in times when you feel like you need to save it. But those problems are VERY minor. I am starting a new play-through, and this time I'm changing my play-style.",1
10,"Walt Disney was a genius in cartooning. Why? Because he had a talent no one else could possibly have. He had the power to create magic. Not magic as in Bibbidy-Bobbody-Boo. No. This magician's magic was to create another world. A world with magic and where dreams come true. Where creatures could come and go as they please. Where good always triumphs evil. He touched other people's hearts with his characters, ideas, and films. I believe those films came from the heart. It was amazing to watch Alice discover Wonderland or Peter Pan fly or to see Snow White kiss the prince. Then there's Mickey Mouse and his pals. The famous trio of Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, and Goofy always having their funny moments. Disney then brought a miracle to Earth. He brought Disneyland. It's not a miracle just for it's fun entertainment. But because that's the only place where I feel that I don't live in a cruel, demented world and where I can live in the world Disney lived in in his imaginations. He has inspired the whole world to keep his legacy alive. Disney is the kind of man who will live immortally. His imaginations and ideas will always stay in the heart of mine and Disneyland. Fantasia was the classical musical that inspired me totally. But the thing that inspired me the most, was Kingdom Hearts. I said Disney inspired the whole world. Well, he inspired Japan and the USA to team up together to join Disney with Final Fantasy. I must say, the mixture created something sweet. Something I have craved for all my life. Kingdom Hearts has a story that no one could have thought of in their wildest. It took the inspiration of Disney for it to work. Kingdom Hearts has a musical score that makes my inner self cry. The trailer for Kingdom Hearts made me excited but depressed at the same time. Kingdom Hearts is a world with nothing compared to Earth. In Kingdom Hearts, there's darkness, but there's always a happy ending. In the trailer, when Sora was attacked by Sabor, my heart pounded. Then, Tarzan made his heroic appearance. In real life, no one will care for you. But the new trio of Sora, Donald, and Goofy makes a true friendship that will last forever. But why is it that peace and happy endings are found in other worlds? But Kingdom Hearts has taught me to appreciate what I have and appreciate where I live and make the best out of it. Kingdom Hearts was bound to exist. I'm glad it did. The sequel will be just the same, or better. I have a fuzzy, happy feeling in my gut. The bravery conflicts of Sora vs. the Heartless and the malicious Disney villains that are swallowed by darkness. Kingdom Hearts has also taught me that the heart is powerful. As Sora said, ""The heart may be weak. And sometimes, it may even give in. But I know deep down there's a light that never goes out!"" That's what Kingdom Hearts has taught me. Aside from my family, Kingdom Hearts' story is something I will treasure forever. Maybe, Heaven will be the world I think of about Kingdom Hearts. Where friendship always lasts. Where dreams come true. Where the heartless are banished and the golden hearts are welcomed. The battles are daring and the graphics are real enough to convince me that real life can be like Kingdom Hearts. We just need to make the world a better place. But I suppose not many people will agree. I'm sick of the evil in this world. Disney has inspired me to think that happiness is found in what you can achieve in for yourself. Kingdom Hearts will live forever in my heart just like Walt Disney's legacy of dreams and hope. I'm sure those who are reading this may think I'm a mushy person. So what if I am?! Only I can see what Kingdom Hearts really is. It's not just fun, it's magical. I don't care what anyone else thinks. I believe that Disney and Kingdom Hearts is what life should truly be. Happy endings and magical dreams and inspirations. Walter Elias Disney and Kingdom Hearts will be immortal. Everyone else appreciates Kingdom Hearts as a game. I appreciate it as a miracle to imaginations. Kingdom Hearts always gives me a happy, fuzzy feeling in my cheeks that I love. May Walt Disney Rest In Peace and may Kingdom Hearts live forever! One of the greatest hits of fantasy history. If you have any comments for me, please e-mail me at tylerripen@yahoo.com. I give Kingdom Hearts a solid 100. It's perfect. That's my honest opinion. Honesty is a quality that makes us live longer. Walt Disney, you have done a great job on the inspiring to create such a tale as Kingdom Hearts. Rest In Peace.",1
10,"NO SPOILERS This is definitely one of the most amazing games I have played in my life. It made me cry and I was 14 when I first played the game! It has all the Disney characters and worlds that have been around for a long time, some of its own characters(the wonderful Sora, Riku, and Kairi) and of course you've got my favorites, the Final Fantasy characters(Cloud, Squall, Yuffie, etc.) I just have to point this out, Sora and Kairi's romance has got to be one of the sweetest loves I have ever seen. It made me cry at how beautiful it was. The characters are all wonderful, and definitely lovable! I love these characters so much I hope to see a third game! The story is so clever and original and powerful. I never suspected combining Final Fantasy and Disney, I was expecting it to be something cheesy, but it worked. The relationships between the characters are so heartfelt and sometimes heartbreaking and sad. I suggest to parents, watch your kids play this. It is just so beautiful.10/10, just a wonderful game for all ages! The Kingdom Hearts franchise will never be forgotten.",1
10,"I simply love this game, its challenging in some parts, sad and its shows that the heart is the strongest weapon of all.I like how they added all the Disney characters and their evil villains and you have to fight them. This is one of the better games Square Enix has made along with Final Fantasy 10 and Final Fantasy 7.My Favorite character is Sora. A brave young boy who stands against the Heartless and he is only like 14, 15 years. It first caught my interest when I saw It at the movie Store, because of all the Disney characters on the front and back. I thought wow this looks like a interesting game. To tell you the truth I thought this would be a RPG because it was made by Squae Enix since they make lots of RPG's. So I tried it. At first I thought the beginning was boring but then when I found Wakka and Tidus. I am thinking these guys are from Final Fantasy 10! Then when I got to Traverse town I found Leon, Yuffie, Aeris, and I found Cloud at the Olimpus Coliseum!!! It was puzzled for a while but it said there was going to be some final fantasy characters. I love this GAME!",1
10,"Kingdom Hearts, I'm saying this straight out, it is one of the best video games ever created. Video Games don't get much better than this, it is absolutely magical. The kind of magic you got from Disney 50 years ago with movies like Bambi or Snow White. The imagery is way ahead for its time. (2002) If you don't like this game, I have no clue what to say to you expect good luck ever liking a video game.This movie is enchanting to the point you want the characters to be real. I mean it is quite an addicting game. It soothes your mind and takes all the problems you have on the real world. I give this movie a 10/10. I would rate it way higher if I could.",1
4,".I'm not surprised at the 9.3 rating this game has because unfortunately the power of Enix's fanatics is a powerful thing .It has been my experience with games (Final Fantasy) that have Enix's name slapped on it is AUTOMATICALLY given a high rating no matter how abysmal the actually contents are. The thing with Enix's walking dollar signs is Enix's games=high scores automatically to them,but Enix here's one person who isn't under your spell.Plot: Friends Sora(14) Kairi(14) and Riku(15) live on Destiny Islands. Riku bored of their home tells them they should build a raft and sail off on it to see other worlds. Their plans are dashed when a storm brews that night and their home is swallowed up by darkness. Sora is saved by a mysterious weapon called a keyblade. Riku.Kairi disappear in darkness. Sora sets of with Donald and Goofy to find their king(Mickey) who has also gone missing and his friends. Game is your basic light vs. dark story, and clichéd as those stories are they can be done beautifully in the hands of competent people with loads of imagination. This game had so much potential that it makes me want to weep that it wasn't realized. First, the story should have not had Disney or Final Fantasy anywhere near it. Should have been an entirely original light vs dark ,original characters, worlds story with different companies behind the helm. Having Disney in it already handicapped it because Disney=Kiddie and with kiddie having a deep mature storyline is already thrown out the window. Enix should not have been near it because Character Development and Story are not their strong suits and this game was NO exception. All the worlds you visit with the exception of 3 are Disney and mostly all of them have nothing to do with the main plot. Fortunately the main plot picks up,but unfortunately it's the 3rd world(Neverland) to the end of the game. It's like Enix/Disney forgot they were suppose to be telling a STORY and then when they finally do remember you are literally at the end. You know those things used to tell a story, CUTSCENES, yea that. Well good luck trying to find them. This game had so few cut- scenes to the point of being ridiculous. Sadly the few cut- scenes you do get pertaining to the main story will leave you going ? The story of this game is so convulsed that when you finally get to the so-called climatic cutscene your left feeling WHAT THAT'S IT?!! Wait this story made NO COHESIVE sense and the game is ENDING?! It HAS to be more to flesh out the story and characters!!! Sadly there isn't. Hence my feeling of wanting to weep for what this game COULD have been.Characters:Sora is likable because his innocence make him endearing. Unfortunately that's all you get from him He's innocent and...? From the manual it says Kairi is one of the main characters and yet all her cutscenes combined would barely scrap 30 minutes. I get she loss her heart but what about the scenes before she loss her heart or after she got it back. WHERE WAS THE DEEP CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT?! NOT JUST FOR HER BUT FOR ANY OF THE CHARACTERS?!! I mean Kairi(And six other people) play a pivotal role in the games main plot and all I get from her in the manner of character development is 30 minutes COMBINED?! The other six even less. If I had to say anyone got any DEEP character development no matter how minimal it would be Riku. I liked him(I don't know why)He had a huge chip on his shoulder where his attitude was concerned, he was jealous of Sora and he was a bit to fascinated with darkness. From what I gathered from the ending a man who's obsessed with darkness named Ansem is the REAL villain of the game and yet despite a one minute cameo appearance at the beginning you see nor hear from him until the END. Instead we get 5 minute cameos from Disney villains and Disney Maleificent who seemed to be the REAL villain of the game until she dies in the second to last world and then Ansem decides he wants to finally make another appearance. Battle System: LOVED IT. Real time. No boring turn-based. Battles were actually fun..to a point. Not only did Enix/Disney seem to think that Story and Character Development should be as minimal and confusing as possible,but also thought that Hard=Fun. NO! Take out fun and replace with boring and frustrating then they would have got it right. With me when dieing from a boss starts reaching 6, 7 going on to the double digits I get frustrated then when I have to level up to INSANE levels just to finally beat them I get bored and when I get bored I eventually stop playing. Battling can only take you so far. If you are like me and get games for the STORY rather than GAMEPLAY then having emphasis on gameplay by making the bosses near impossible to beat to the point that you CAN'T go on with the story you start to hate the game. Something to ponder Enix. Music: HATED almost every song and not because Disney. I would have hated it had they came from ANYONE. Eargrating plain and simple.Had to mute for the majority of the game. I just couldn't take it. The only music that doesn't make you feel like your ears are bleeding is Simple and Clean, the worlds Hallow Bastion and the End of the World. I'll like to think that none of the songs that I actually could stomach are not Disney by mere coincidence.Visuals: Nice/Bad. Would have loved to actually HEAR the wonderful voice talent(when they actually got to speak that is)instead of READING it.",-1
9,"Long before Infinity War brought together all heroes of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the shared universe mania kicked off, Kingdom Hearts did pretty much the same for Disney. In a bizarre yet briljant move, Disney and Square Enix joined forces to create a game that combined the magic of Disney with the dark anime storytelling of Final Fantasy to create Kingdom Hearts. While many may raise an eyebrow at a game that features Goofy and Donald Duck going toe to toe with Cloud Strife and Squall Leonhart, the brilliance lies in the execution.Kingdom Hearts is known for its dense, indecipherable story. While this is definitely true for later installments, the original game's plot is still fairly comprehensible. Sora, a young boy who is the perfect cross between a Disney and a Square anime character, loses his home world in an attack by dark beings known as the Heartless, and teams up with Donald Duck and Goofy to save various Disney worlds from said beasties, with the help of a band of Disney and Final Fantasy characters and a strange weapon called the Keyblade (which literally looks what it sounds like). Looking for Sora's friends and King Mickey Mouse respectively (the latter of whom, despite being Disney's best-known player, is mostly an unseen and enigmatic presence over the course of the story), Sora, Donald and Goofy go up against a conspiracy of Disney villains led by Sleeping Beauty's Maleficent, who have kidnapped seven Princesses of Hearts (most of which are actual Disney Princesses) that apparently have the power to open the door to the heart of all worlds. KH's gameplay is fairly straightforward hack and slash, but includes a lot of RPG elements (customizeable weapons, items, equipment and magic spells) and, depending on the boss, some strategy elements. Although most battles do come down to mashing X, there is still strategy required - the three-headed hell hound Cereberus (from Disney's Hercules), for instance, has various attacks which all require a different response. One attack is best avoided by staying behind him, another by jumping on his back, and yet another by simply avoiding those all-consuming jaws. Whereas Sephiroth has a devastating attack that will surely kill you unless you use a very well-timed item. Still, the quick pace of the fights and the different powers and weaknesses of the many Heartless and Disney villains you encounter make for a thrilling spectacle. The boss battles especially - when you're fighting Jafar, Hades or Ursula, they really live up to the menace they are portrayed as in their source movies. The one drawback gameplay-wise is the much maligned Gummi Ship sections, which are required to reach each world. How the hell does a game with gorgeously rendered Disney worlds and action-packed battles also include on-rails space battles that look like rubber StarFox missions where you shoot at random polygonal objects? It's amazing that, even after ten games, Nomura still hasn't realized people actually really hate these segments. Fortunately, you eventually acquire a warp that allows you to jump to places you've been before. Frankly, I've never flown a Gummi Ship mission other than those required for the story. Apparently there's a ship editor feature, but I've never bothered to even look at it.Chances are you'll enjoy watching Kingdom Hearts as much as playing it. There's hours of voiced cutscenes, and even after 16 years the graphics - since gorgeously re-rendered in HD for the ReMixes - still hold up, perfectly emulating the look and feel of every Disney movie covered in the game. No small feat, considering how good Disney's animators are. Even the stop-motion Tim Burton film The Nightmare Before Christmas (not released under the Walt Disney banner, but owned by Touchstone which is a sudsidiary of Disney) is included, with graphics that are appropriately darker and more realistic in appearance, to accomodate the stop-motion look of the film. Also, Disney and Square went out of their way to find the original voice actors for all the Disney characters in the game. In addition to Donald, Goofy, Mickey and more, characters such as Hades, Jafar, Ursula, Tarzan and Jack Skellington are voiced by the same actors as the original film. When the original character is not used, the official voice actor from the DTV sequels or adjacent TV series is used, as is the case for Genie, Philoctetes and others. Two actors deserve special mention: Kathryn Beaumont, who reprised her roles as Alice from Alice in Wonderland and Wendy from Peter Pan half a century after the original films premiered (you can sorta tell it's an old lady pretending to be a young girl, but who cares), and Corey Burton, the verbal chameleon who effortlessly mimics the original voice actors of Captain Hook, Flotsam & Jetsam, the White Rabbit and more, and who would go on to do the same in future games for characters such as Shan-Yu and Commander Sark. Characters original to the game, or Final Fantasy characters that lacked voices in their original games, are played by A-listers such as Hayden Panettiere, Mandy Moore and David Boreanaz (you know, Angel from Buffy). Special mention goes to Billy Zane, who plays the evil Ansem and, despite having only a dozen lines or so, steals the show whenever he pops up. Hayley 'I see dead people' Joel Osment is perfect as Sora, the main playable protagonist who is a perfect stand-in for the audience as he traverses one Disney world after another with wide-eyed wonder.One small gripe in the graphics - not all cutscenes use fully animated character models. While important scenes have full facial animation, others use in-game animations which is just the mouth and eyes opening and closing. In the latter case, the movements don't match up with the English dialogue (the game is originally from Japan). Musically, Kingdom Hearts is another standout. While each world has a standard looped field and battle theme (which can be a bit generalistic, but pretty good nonetheless), the boss battle themes are truly epic, giving a sense of dread and urgency when you're fighting the enraged Clayton or the terrifying Dragon Maleficent (one of the hardest Disney bosses in the series). Also, various emotional themes made specifically for the cutscenes showcase the extent of composer Yoko Shimomura's talent, especially Kairi's poignant theme and the orchestral version of the theme song, Simple and Clean. Ah, Simple and Clean. While I've tried getting into J-pop singer Utada Hikaru's other work and found it boring (I'm more of a metal guy anyway), her Kingdom Hearts songs are among my absolute favorite musical pieces. To this day, after finishing the game dozens of times, the ending cinematic where the song kicks in still sends chills down my spine. Although it is now part of a franchise with its own ever-extending lore, Kingdom Hearts still works on its own as well. While very different from any other Disney or Square game, it finds its own voice - quite a feat for a game relying mainly on characters not original to its story - and manages to emulate the magic of a Disney film all on its own, and allowing us to hop from one childhood favorite to the next. While many scenes echoe famous Disney moments (such as Jafar becoming a genie, Clayton going after the gorillas, the Crocodile chasing after Captain Hook), every Disney world still feels part of a bigger whole story-wise, and the game deftly balances a dozen worlds and over a hundred characters into a grand narrative on a scale that wasn't seen again until the Marvel Cinematic Universe kicked off six years later.",1
8,"Great game, but it have one annoying problem, game doesn't f*ing tells you where you need to go and what you need to do, no map, no waypoins, no current objective. You are needed to look in to every corner (with infinite spawning enemies).You can't skip cutscenes, even after the game is finished, i want to see how much time i spend on it or play after ending, I only see inscription ""The End"", and can't do anything, i can only turn off console. These are trivial things, but if you sum up this that's a problem.",1
8,"I have to admit that I would not have grasped the meaning of the film without the description. The scenes with the squealing pig were very appalling at first but better to be understood after thinking the film over. I was very impressed by the the part of the father, who was on the one hand an authority, demanding not very little of his son, on the other hand being very caring even without really understanding what was going on with the boy. The film made clear in quite a beautiful way that father and son have a conflict going on but still retain mutual respect. Sadly, the father (as I ...) understood his son and his capabilities too late.",1
10,"The most staggering 7-minute film I have ever seen. As quality as a 3 taco combo platter. Don't miss this sci-fi experience...its GLORIOUS!!!Lewis and Maney capture the essence of sci-fi in a film that is both interesting and manages to poke fun at the entire genre.The cinematography in the film is amazing. Various camera angles, excellent lighting techniques, and unique perspectives give this film a truly eery feel while not losing the unique humor that will make you laugh out loud.This film could only have been improved if it was longer. The restriction was placed due to its entry into the 48 hour film festival. That's right, this amazing piece of film history was written, filmed, and edited in less than 48 hours.",1
10,"This short film is extremely entertaining, regardless of how long it took to make. The cinematography is great, and the overall craft and execution is quite impressive. The acting was amateurish at times, but generally held together well by Lea. Lea's portrayal of an undercover agent wasn't as convincing as I had hoped (more like a college student). However his sarcastic delivery and subtle humor made the film a lot of fun to watch.Lewis and Maney have proved to be an excellent film making team. If you've seen Glorious then you're already aware that these guys are on the rise.Can't wait to see their next film.",1
8,"As said many, many times, love animation to bits, always have. Not just Disney, Looney Tunes, Tom and Jerry, Tex Avery and Hanna Barbera, but getting older it also broadened to include Pixar, Studio Ghibli, Soyuzmultfilm and Fleischer. It has always been a huge part of my life and helped me through all the tough times in school, with a broader knowledge actually appreciate it even more now.Very like as has been said with 'Darkwing Duck' and 'Talespin' in individual episodes of them, 'DuckTales' is a show dear to my heart. While not quite one of the all-time greats in animation and ever it is a personal favourite and one of my favourite shows from Disney. Felt that way as a child, still do. One of those personal favourites from a young age that has held up very well (not all my childhood favourites have), and like many favourites seen recently as a young adult 'DuckTales' is even more entertaining through adult eyes from appreciating the writing and stories even more.Not one of my favourite episodes but still very enjoyable. It would have been even better though if the supporting/secondary cast were more memorable.The animation in ""Jungle Duck"" looks very pleasing on the eyes, nothing shoddy about it. Instead it is very vibrant, fluidly drawn and the attention to detail in the backgrounds is also note-worthy. Can say nothing wrong about the music, the score is dynamic, beautifully orchestrated, never jarring with the action and full of energy. Just as animated shows of this kind should be. It is impossible to resist or forget the theme song, one of the catchiest in animation and ever.""Jungle Duck's"" writing is even smarter, even more intelligent and even funnier as an adult. Part of this is due to understanding and appreciating the references, which came over as very funny and brilliantly timed when a child but easier to get and notice as an adult. Have found the same experience re-visiting other favourites like 'Animaniacs', 'Pinky and the Brain' and 'Tiny Toon Adventures'. The dialogue is hilarious, quotable and surprisingly fresh by today's standards, also surprisingly thought-provoking and educational.Similarly great in ""Jungle Duck"" is the storytelling. It is very compelling as a story, that is not predictable or repetitive, also not taking too long to get started or to the point. It is immensely entertaining to watch, has thrills and energy aplenty, is never dull and has emotional investment while the conflict has tension.Have always loved the characters. Scrooge is one of those characters that does live up to his name at first, a notable example actually of the show being here, but the character grows and goes on a journey. It is wonderful to see Huey, Duey and Louie be given distinct personalities and it is much easier to tell them apart as a result than before when partnered with their uncle Donald Duck. Launchpad adds a lot.In ""Jungle Duck"", the voice acting is faultless. Cannot imagine anybody else as the character of Scrooge than Alan Young, he is a big reason why Scrooge works so well as a character. Likewise with Terence McGovern. Frank Welker has fun in his roles.Summarising, very enjoyable. 8/10 Bethany Cox",1
8,"""Blackmail Order Bride"" opens with Majors Nelson and Healey being hailed after a successful lunar mission, with George Furth as nosy reporter Charlie Farnum, desperate to get an exclusive on the reclusive Nelson. Posing as a plumber, he manages to get past Jeannie and plant a hidden video recorder inside Tony's house. After Farnum's evidence is destroyed by Jeannie, a strange woman shows up with two kids in Dr. Bellows' office, claiming to be his wife and sons. Jeannie is devastated to think that Tony deserted his wife and family, the perfect headline for Farnum's sensational story, and seeks a divorce in Reno, Persia. Major Nelson completely unburdens himself and with Jeannie's help shows Farnum all the evidence he needs to prove his story to Dr. Bellows. Fortunately, the good doctor refuses to believe the wild tale, and with his photos again reduced to nothing Farnum has no story to publish, his blackmail scheme undone. George Furth was a busy character player who excelled in obnoxious types, perfectly cast as the snoop.",1
10,"Warning do not read unless seen episode.This is part one of the finale arc for season one. It's also one of the darkest arcs I've ever seen in TV, from the content this episode starts out pretty dark. This is a tragic back story I put up there with ""Batman"" and any others.I'm going to get out one negative first before we get to business. For one Usagi/Sailor Moon in the final battle says some really bad dialog that I felt should of been edited, I know it was suppose to be a clever quip but it just falls flat and is completely inappropriate. Usagi should of retorted with angry emotion toward Kunsite and beat the crap out of him since he was partial responsible for the fall of the moon kingdom and her true mom which would of made the battle even better; at least that's what I would've done.The other bad thing was that this was a singular episode, I honestly wish it was more of a two parter because it felt like there was a certain amount of depth I wish was uncovered. I also would of liked to of got an even better feel for Sailor Moon's true mother, there should of been a few more scenes with her like seeing her interact with her daughter a little.But oh well, the only way we'd be able to uncover more is if the franchise decided to do an expanded universe which would actually be a really cool idea; I don't understand why the hell not.Anyway down to business, not a lot I can say there is a final battle with Kunsite which is decent, though I felt there should of been something more to it which is another weak point of the episode. However what really powers this episode is in the revelations of the hidden past life of Sailor Moon and the Saior Senchi.It is just fascinating and a fun concept suggesting that the show takes place in an alternate reality as we see people use to live on planets a long time ago. I really love the design of the Moon Kingdom it's just beautiful almost like a place you'd want to live in, it's sort of Romanistic and even a little Eastern Euripean architecture.Despite only a glimpse of this lifetime, it offers a broad sense of mystery. Seeing this as a kid for the first time it stirred up lots of questions like since the Sailor Senchi are all princesses of their planets what were their kingdoms like? If the moon kingdom existed does that mean those lost civilizations like Atlantis, Mu, Lumaria, and others exist as well? I could go on and on.We get a little explanation as to the war with the Negaverse and the cause of it. And we get more insight into the relationship between Serenity/Usagi and Endymion/Marmou. I'll admit I really got a good feel for the relationship and feel sad when it comes to an untimely end; what they both had was so beautiful both had aspirations in life and they've been stolen.We even get a bit of a good feel for Sailor Moon's mom when we see how much she truly has sacrificed to save her kingdom but most importantly the life of her daughter. She was able to banish the forces of darkness back to the Negaverse if temporarily. However it was not without a price as we see by using the energy of the Silver Crystal it also uses the life force of the welder. And we see with the last of her life force she then commits one last act by giving Serenity/Usagi, the other planetary princesses, Endymion/Marmou, and everyone else from the Moon Kingdom another chance at life by sending them all to the future on Earth to be reincarnated.I'll admit the last few moments are just heart sinking and put a little tear in my eye as we see everyone from the moon go to their new lives in the future, only one remains at the end of her life. We then see a beautiful cinematography where is zooms back and we see Sailor Moon's mother lying on top a couple of fallen pillars which are in the shape of a crucifix, which just shows and solidifies her sacrifice.The past is always paved with sacrifices to make way for the present to go to the future.Rating: 4 stars",1
4,"I often think that the acting of Ronald Reagan is unfairly maligned. While he was far from a great actor, he was very nice in many films--playing an excellent ""everyman"". However, Reagan himself must take some of the blame for his reputation, as the films he chose to perform in were often quite limp--particularly at the end of his career. Often, he seemed to take any part and didn't seem to follow up on his successes. For example, at the same time he made THE VOICE OF THE TURTLE and JOHN LOVES MARY (both wonderful films), he also made THAT HAGEN GIRL (among the entries in Harry Medved's book ""The Fifty Worst Films of All Time"").Now early in his career, Reagan also was relegated to some dreadful B-films but at least with most of these you can't blame him. He was not yet a star and simply had to take what the studio gave him. Despite despising his Brass Bancroft films (and they were bad), he had no choice but to take them as he was a lowly bit actor until his breakout films, such as KINGS ROW.Considering that SERGEANT MURPHY was only Reagan's third film and his first starring film, you can certainly understand his acting with a horse! Yes, I did say horse! It seems that 'Sergeant Murphy' is actually the name of a horse and Ronnie is devoted to it in a rather strange and unnatural way (not THAT unnatural--get your mind out of the gutter). When his father sold the horse to the military, Reagan joined the army just to be near the Sergeant!! I don't know about you, but I'd just find another horse! However, this is a Hollywood B-film and naturally by the time it's over (just 57 minutes later), Ron not only has gotten the girl but Sergeant Murphy is world-famous and a champion--all in under one hour! There is nothing particularly bad about the film but sadly there is absolutely nothing good about the film other than Reagan's surprisingly good performance. He was an avid horseman in real life and served with the cavalry, so he was able to make this ludicrous film seem convincing to a degree I wouldn't have thought possible. However, it's still a pretty dumb film and not even for a millisecond is the plot believable or even particularly interesting.",-1
3,"Usually, the Warner Brothers programmers of the 1930s were fast-paced and crisp and filled with sparkle. That is missing in this programmer that stars a young Ronald Reagan as an Army Sergeant who wants to purchase a horse that the army is trying to get rid of. Sergeant Murphy is the name of that horse, and while he's not Bonzo, Reagan has great faith in him. because of anonymity law that prohibits an active soldier from buying army animals, Reagan is unable to purchase Sergeant Murphy as long as he is an enlisted man, and as soon as he gets out, he hunts around for him, ultimately trying to enter Sergeant Murphy in a horse race.There's always a romance in these type of films and that it always involves a girl whose father hates the hero. In this case, the father is Reagan's commanding officer, Donald Crisp, and the girl is Warner Brothers starlet Mary McGuire, certainly no Francis, Davis, Sheridan or Blondell. She's sweet and charming, but lacks star quality.Sam McDaniel gets a stereotypical subsurvient black servant role, with the unique name of Henry H. Henry. (Guess what the H stands for...) He gets a few uncomfortable laughs. There's no real point to the film, a disappointment considering that Warner Brothers was known for their social issue dramas, this really providing only a minimal amount of entertainment and sort of just laying there. At under an hour, it seems even longer.",-1
8,"... and possibly one of the best *ever* made.This video is a gigantic poke in the eye to anyone who believes that extremely sexually explicit action and an interesting, compelling plot can't ever exist in the same production. Some of the scenes were almost too explicit for my liking, but they never made me want to stop watching. And while the basic storyline is one that's been done to death by cyberpunk writers and gamers, it remains intriguingly presented here. As the accompanying BTS footage makes clear, the production team worked their fingers to the bone to make this near future video look and feel plausible.There's only a couple of problems. While Eva Angelina's acting is top-notch, her delivery of her lines isn't quite as clear as it needs to be. (Contrast, for example, the clarity of Hillary Scott's character.) And it's really not clear how and Derrick Pierce's character reaches the conclusion that he reaches in the film's penultimate scene. And the decision to film one of the sequences in black and white is really unfortunate, as it fails to present Kylie Ireland's lovely red hair in all its glory.Perhaps the most fascinating and novel element of the storyline, in my opinion, is the fact that none of the three leading characters have sex with each other. That's an ironic statement. In a mainstream film, if characters had chemistry with each other, as these ones do, and there wasn't some hint of that chemistry achieving fruition, that would be a case of putting a gun on the mantle in the first act without having it fired by the end of the play. But in a pornographic film, it's *expected* that everyone will do everyone else, and so keeping the characters from doing so, in a way that preserves them, is an intriguing choice.",1

Songye Lu and continues to build on a exploration of the traditions, and a Neo- Realist presentation of the people, in Tibet.Fluidly running the hand-held camera along farmers dipping their rams in for a wash, Tseden sows a jagged documentary atmosphere of harsh natural light wrapped round long stilted shots, sipping the warmth in observing Darje and Drolkar (played by a excellent, understated Jinpa and Sonam Wangmo) playing with their children.Playing a TV glazed with a blue tint in the background announcing news of the first test tube baby, the screenplay by Tseden elegantly grooves gentle, earthy comedy of the children finding condoms under the pillows of their parents,and mistaking them for balloons.Tseden flies into sombre criticism of Mainland China's ""child policy"", with the dry humour getting steamed away by Drolkar and Dargye's disagreements over a unplanned pregnancy, weighed by the risks of facing a huge fine from the birth of the child.Balancing the weight from the fear the poor rural family face from the fine, Tseden explores the Tibetan belief in reincarnation, which Dargye has such faith in,that it overrides him listening to the opinion of his wife.With the political on one side,and the spiritual on the other,Tseden centres the title on a excellent character study of Drolkar, who in attempts by the state and her testosterone- fuelled husband to suppress her free choice, kicks against them, as the land is covered in the shadow of a balloon.",1
9,"This was an excellent movie. I read the facts about it after seeing it and was stunned to find that this was true. Absolutely worth watching. Amazing courage and resilience. Read the Wiki page after you've seen the film.This kept me on the edge of my seat. For the movie the film makers added some Stasi aspects which worked well, as there are so many people in the world who really don't know much about this dark era of German history other than that there was a 'wall' between east and west Germany. Younger generations will practically not even have heard of that or remember or know about the huge news event this was worldwide when the wall came down. (The wall = Barbed wire, razor wire and soldiers shooting at you. We should be ashamed in our western societies where we put up walls to this day!! Has nothing about ugliness and meaningless control of citizens been learned???) Watch it. Total suspense from beginning to end.",1
8,"From Venice Film Festival 2019, Tromsø International Film Festival 2020, Tokyo FILMeX 2019, Shanghai International Film Festival 2020 to Oslo Films from the South Festival 2019, this was the film that attracted a special attention ! Director Pema Tseden's name is now remembered around the world, thanks to this amazing work of film art where a Tibetan sheepherding family attempts to deal with a seismic event in their lives.Truthful, poetic, full of courage and resilience, this movie will show you a real world of faith, life in close connection with the forces of nature, and a power of individual and the family - positive and negative!",1
9,"Felt in the hands of a master storyteller from the opening scenes shot through an opaque film, that we soon learn is a balloon. The narrative and cinematography are so captivating we forgot we were in a theatre. We are in rural Tibet, yet the family lives in a very modern world, albeit controlled by what is considered modern for Chinese society. Yet the characters are as sophisticated as any one in Paris or Melbourne. A joy to watch.",1
7,"Let me just say I liked all the Santa Clause movies in their own right. This is a decent sequel to an amiable first film, that is good spirited, fun and sweet. It is not the best Christmas movie out there, but it doesn't try to be. If the kids get past the rather thin plot, and that the script isn't always particularly groundbreaking or new, they are in for a festive for a treat, adults too. However, it has a very good message, and it is guaranteed to put a smile on your face.The soundtrack is also lovely to the ears and the look of the film is nice. I don't know about you guys, but like the first film I felt good while watching this movie, and for me that is a good thing. The performances are very good, Tim Allen as always is very likable and completely watchable. And the supporting characters like Cupid and Father Time are so cute a movie of their own would suit them perfectly.All in all, a nice movie. Not groundbreaking, but a pleasant Christmas diversion, and as far as sequels go, I personally think it's one of the better ones. 7/10 Bethany Cox",1
6,"Scott Calvin (Tim Allen) has been Santa for awhile, but only now is he told that there is more Santa Clause. He must marry a Mrs Claus before Christmas eve. In addition, his son Charlie has landed on the Naughty List. He decides to go south and leave a substitute Santa in his place. While he falls for Charlie's principal Carol Newman (Elizabeth Mitchell), the substitute Santa stirs up trouble and puts every child on the Naughty List.This still has some of the original charm. Most of it comes from Carol slowly finding out Scott is actually Santa. Charlie's complaint about his father is less convincing. I don't think the secret is that big of a deal. It feels very fake. I rather not have an excuse for his misbehaving. There is a good lesson to be had there, but it ends rather weakly. It's a missed learning opportunity. Besides that, the movie is good family fun.",1
7,"Scott Calvin (Tim Allen) has been a humble Santa Claus for nearly ten years, but it might come to an end if he does not find a Mrs. Claus.Rotten Tomatoes sums this film up as ""predictable and forgettable"". I suppose it is predictable, but not really any more than the first one. Forgettable? Maybe, maybe not. I thought the toy Santa was a great character, and bringing in Father Time and the others was a nice touch, if a bit silly.If I had any real problem with the film, it was the romance part. I understand he has a limited time to woo a woman, but to basically bribe someone into loving you, and then falling in love and getting married within a day or two? Not unheard of, but certainly not the safest foundation with which to build a future.This film comes across as even better once you have seen the third installment, which is more or less universally accepted as the worst.",1
4,"The first film, which gave the the leading actor his first starring role in a feature film, was a Christmas romp, but the last thing you may expect is a sequel, especially eight years later, but it happened. Basically Scott Calvin (Tim Allen) has been the new Santa Claus for the last eight years, with loyal elves, but his teenage son Charlie (Eric Lloyd) is getting himself into trouble at school and being added to the naughty list. But there are bigger problems when Santa starts to slim and lose his white beard and hair very slowly, the explanation is that the card given to him by the original Santa had another microscopic ""Clause"" he and the elves missed. He must find a Mrs. Clause before the end of Christmas Eve, he has very little magic to use to help him on his way, and if he uses it all he won't be able to get back to the North Pole, and if time runs out he is no longer Santa. Before he leaves Santa agrees with Curtis the Experimental Elf (The Cat in the Hat's Spencer Breslin) that there should someone to keep an eye on the toy workshop and elves, so with a new fangled machine, a seemingly exact copy of Santa, named Toy Santa (also Allen), is made. Returning to America, and with a little advice from ex-wife Laura (Wendy Crewson) and her new husband Dr. Neil Miller (Beverly Hills Cop's Judge Reinhold), Scott starts searching for a woman he has things in common with. As Charlie continues to be naughty in school, Scott gets the chance to talk to Principal Carol Newman (Lost's Elizabeth Mitchell), and he finds himself instantly attracted to her, so much that he asks her out. Meanwhile the new Toy Santa, starting clunky, is slowly becoming mean with his attitude to the naughty list, well, all kids in general, saying that they will all get coal this year. There is a point when Carol is made to hate Scott when he tries to convince her who she is, and with no magic left it looks like he can't go back, but he does get back and is aware of the disastrous situation. In the end Toy Santa is stopped, Carol finds out Scott is indeed Santa with beard and gut back, and he confesses that he wasn't expecting to fall in love with the woman he found for a wife, and of course in the end that is what she becomes. Also starring David Krumholtz as Bernard the head Elf, Liliana Mumy as Lucy Miller, Kevin Pollak as Cupid, Star Trek: The Next Generation's Michael Dorn as Sandman, Art LaFleur as Tooth Fairy, Aisha Tyler as Mother Nature, Jay Thomas as Easter Bunny and Peter Boyle as Father Time. The first film was better because the concept of becoming Santa was a good hook, and Allen is humorous as the sarcastic working father who has that put on his shoulders. While this film does have still have some good light kiddie humour and a reasonable love story in amongst the other less interesting subplots, it just doesn't feel the same quality as the predecessor, but a near watchable family seasonal fantasy comedy. Okay!",-1
8,Tim Allen returns as everyones favourite modern day Santa in The Santa Clause 2 in which he discovers he has to find a wife in order to continue to be Santa.All the elements and characters that made the first film so fantastic are back with this sequel and Allen again proves why he is such a fantastic comedic actor. As with the first film there are some tender moments with Allen and Mitchell having excellent on screen chemistry. The sleigh riding scene and the Secret Santa scenes remain my favourite scenes in movie history. It is also nice to see David Krumholtz and Judge Reinhold return after such a long break between this and the original film. I think this is what elevates this film above other sequels.I love the original and I love this sequel just as much.,1
5,"Silly, unnecessary sequel is more or less a cash grab resulting from the success of the first film. This one has Tim Allen reprising his role as Scott Calvin, who became Santa in the previous film, needing a Mrs. Claus through some sort of requirement if he wants to ride the sleigh on Christmas Eve night with the reindeer guiding him in his full form of white beard, big belly, and rumbling voice of Ho-Ho-Ho. Needing to leave the workshop of the North Pole in order to find his bride, Calvin, thanks to a genius elf boy and his ""duplicator"", he is able to create a plastic ""replacement"" to tend to matters while away. What happens, unfortunately, is that replacement Santa becomes a monster, fully dedicated to delivering coal ""to all the naughty children"" as his army of toy soldiers keep the elves in the workshop at bay. Meanwhile Scott begins to ""lose"" the Santa weight, white hair and beard, meeting a principal at his son's school (Elizabeth Mitchell) who appears at first to be quite a strict disciplinarian with little tolerance for mischief or bad behavior. While Scott tries to get through to his misunderstood son (Eric Lloyd), his good heart and charm wins over the principal who thought he wasn't considerate of her standards and a bit lacking in parenting his son acting out in ways she is concerned.A fun cast *does* encourage a smile here or there, and I did like the bit with Allen and his lone reindeer, Donner, but the premise (getting hitched in a hurry to Mitchell who finds his claims to be Santa more than a bit hard to believe) had me a bit Bah Humbug. Lots of money was thrown at this sequelyou see that in just the elaborate workshop and Plastic Allen Santa, with Spencer Breslin and David Krumholtz as elves trying to keep him restrained from turning everything upside down and inside out. Allen is almost always watchable and he gives it all he has, especially in the dual roles, getting to stretch a bit. He has good chemistry with the lovely Mitchell, too. But the plot is pencil thinit rides Allen all the way and he does try to carry this load of nonsense as far as he can on just his charisma alone. Do I think it works? For seasonal fare, it is a diversion that works about as well as something like Fred Claus. It more or less fills time and skates by on Allen's comedic skills. But the plot is all gobbledygook. Supporting cast with the likes of Judge Reinhold, Wendy Crewson, and Art LaFleur do what they can in limited roles. The first film was a nice surprise, but multiple sequels maybe were pushing it. The makeup effects on Allen weren't too shabby, going the Klumps route...in reverse!",-1
6,"THE SANTA CLAUSE 2 is fortunate to have TIM ALLEN reprising his role as the gentle man who has a couple of domestic problems to solve at home before he can enter into the spirit of Christmas Eve again. One of them is his son who's having problems at school and the other is the fact that he has a very short time to find a wife. Seems he'll have to give up his Santa role for good unless (as the clause goes) he finds a woman willing to be his wife.None of the situations are able to lift this sequel into the sort of original territory that the first movie had, but at least the cast gives it all a good try. ELIZABETH MITCHELL is completely charming as the school principal who is romanced by Allen in what really is the centerpiece of the story and very well handled by both of them.JUDGE REINHOLD is on hand again, as Dr. Neil Miller along with WENDY CREWSON as his wife and ERIC LLOYD as ""Charlie."" Unfortunately, Reinhold and Crewson have little to do this time while the plot concentrates on the solution to Allen's romantic dilemma.Nice settings, plenty of holiday cheer, and an inventive plot twist involving a substitute Santa (also played effectively by Allen) combine to make this a pleasant enough family entertainment.Not quite as cleverly scripted as the original, it manages to keep the viewer interested thanks mainly to the lead performances of Allen and Mitchell.",1
6,"The Santa Clause 2 (2002): Dir: Michael Lembeck / Cast: Tim Allen, Elizabeth Mitchell, Spencer Breslin, Eric Lloyd, David Kromholtz: Fine plot concept with 2 symbolizing two clauses and two individuals. The idea of introducing Mrs. Clause through another clause is ideal but the playful use of violence is not. Scott Calvin's son is on the naughty list. He must find a Mrs. Clause before Christmas Eve or he will turn back to his old self. A toy Santa is created to continue his duties thus fooling the elves while Calvin quests for Earth. Unfortunately the replica Santa malfunctions and decides to follow the rules thus having coal put in stockings. Director Michael Lembeck does his best to employ as much originality as he can but fooling of the elves with a fake Santa is against character and questionable content for the intended audience. Tim Allen balances the two roles with great comic timing. Elizabeth Mitchell as a principal is obviously set to be Mrs. Claus but their sudden match up is a tad bit sudden. It is missing the courtship part. It is also a bit stereotypical that she suddenly gain weight. Spencer Breslin is amusing as an inventive elf. Eric Lloyd returns as Calvin's son but his role is not as broad. David Krumholtz again plays Bernard the elf who seems ever harassed and irritable. Great visual effects will keep themes from melting away. Score: 6 / 10",1
7,"On par with the first movie.  A Disney type movie that the whole family can view.  Parts were funny, and where did they find those old toys I played with back in the 70's.  Sappy and mellow in parts, and a Reindeer for comic relief. Worth taking the family out!  7/10",1
5,"""The Santa Clause 2"" holds to the long-held Hollywood axiom that sequel films seldom do as well as the first film. While there is some humor, this film picks up where the original left off, only 10 years later. Scott Calvin (played by Tim Allen) has been doing his job as the new Santa, so things are pretty much the same – except for one small matter. The ""Mrs."" clause of his ""contract"" now kicks in. So, this film's new humor is all about Santa finding a mate. There is some fun and mischief, and the film provides a few laughs. The kids may enjoy it, but there's little special or lasting about this film. It's a piece of what has become Hollywood holiday ""fodder"" in the 21st century.",-1
7,"A sequel to the immensely likable The Santa Clause, 'The Santa Clause 2' is An Entertaining Sequel, that works big time!'The Santa Clause 2' Synopsis: Scott Calvin has been a humble Santa Claus for nearly ten years, but it might come to an end if he doesn't find a Mrs. Claus.'The Santa Clause 2' is uncomplicated, undemanding entertainment. It delivers the right amount of fun it promises. The Screenplay is nicely written, offering sweet & cute moments almost throughout. Michael Lembeck's Direction is decent. Cinematography, Editing, Art Design & Make-Up, are appropriately done. Performance-Wise: Tim Allen is absolutely lovable as Santa. The talented actor holds your attention from start to end. Also memorable is Elizabeth Mitchell, who enacts the leading-lady, wonderfully.On the whole, 'The Santa Clause 2' is fun!",1
5,"this sequel lacks the heart and soul of the first one.it's not very funny.in fact,i found it mean spirited and depressing.it also has none of the magic of the first one.if you don't like feeling like you are being preached to,you probably won't like this movie.i also felt a bit creeped out by certain parts of it.it's much too dark to be enjoyable in the same way as the first one.i also felt it strayed into sappiness territory.actually forget strayed into.it went straight into sappiness territory.this movie also has a lot of predictability to it.it's formulaic at times.but the biggest downfall for this movie,in my opinion,is it's sombre atmosphere.i don't think it's a horrible movie,but it sure is a few steps down in quality from the original.not quite painful to watch,but not enjoyable,either.and although i may be out to lunch here,i think parents should use discretion about letting their children watch this,because it is so dark.but that's just my opinion.my vote for the Santa Clause 2 is a 5/10.",-1
9,"The first Santa Clause movie was simple, clean, family fun. It is cute and just a really good watch. I knew I had seen the second one but its been years and what a complete delight it was to watch it again on this Christmas Eve (2013) Quadruple everything...romance, magic, fantasy, fun, family...I was simply floored. This is why sequels are so successful because it gives good film makers the opportunity to build on an already decent premise and make it better and the makers behind The Santa Clause 2 did exactly that. In many ways this film reeks (in a good way) of old fashion Disney fantasy adventures but still has that modern post 2000 feel to it as well. The characters are fun and the story is just so much more interesting and fun. I can't use that word enough...the fun factor is at least tripled in this and not to mention the love and good vibes. I almost teared up a handful of times at a Tim Allen movie for crying out loud!! The first film I couldn't truly point out my ""favourite"" most memorable moments and yet this one...dozens. The Christmas Secret Santa exchange with the teachers, the silly and very campy evil toy Santa, Comet, Chet, the romance with Carol...this is one of the best family movies out there right now. Is it a stone cold classic? Not really for whatever reason but is it a favourite of mine? Heck yes! Tim Allen returns and he is better than ever. In his stand up and sitcoms he can be a little sarcastic (which I love in those settings) but the fact that it doesn't come over into this performance at all is a big kudos to him. He is just brilliant as Scott Calvin aka Santa Clause. He truly has evolved in the character since the last one and is an old pro at being Santa. Allen is just absolutely perfect in this part. Eric Lloyd returns as Calvin's son and I am so pleased because often films like this will replace child actors but he does come back. That being said I didn't feel like he was quite as good as he was the first time around. He feels a little clumsy in the role but he's also very necessary to the story and I'd much rather have him back than a new actor. Elizabeth Mitchell joins the cast as tough as nails principal Carol. She is a great addition to the cast and her chemistry with Allen is excellent. Her transformation and ""softening"" is so great to watch and she gets the bulk of the emotional storyline. Spencer Breslin also joins the cast and by the book elf Curtis. I quite enjoy his small performance but he's very underused much like Bernard was in the first and is again in this one. David Krumholtz is terrific as Bernard and has good chemistry with Allen but he is in so few scenes. Wendy Crewson and Judge Reinhold are in one extremely small scene returning to their respective roles from the first. Liliana Mumy joins the cast as their daughter. She is adorable and also a good addition to the cast and does a good job.Director Michael Lembeck is a Disney director through and through. He has had a ton of experience in sitcoms and he clearly is very talented and passionate about telling a good story. I think its interesting he has worked on some of my favourite projects over the years so I obviously like his style. The sub-plot of the evil toy Santa who takes over the North Pole is almost unnecessary and yet it adds a certain level of adventure and gives the story its main villain without being dark or scary for really young kids. Without that sub-story then it wouldn't be quite as watchable for the young kids that might find the romance and quest part of it not as interesting. Plus the campy, funny, toy Santa just makes it simply more fun. I honestly wasn't expecting this instalment to be anywhere near as good as the first and it blew me away. I have never gotten around to seeing the third and I will be watching it very soon whether its pre-Christmas or just after because I am excited!! This is one of the best ""for everybody"" movies out there. Get it now for the family!! 9/10",1
5,"After accidentally causing Santa's death, Scott Calvin inadvertently became the big man himself due to a clause in a contract he didn't know he was signing. Eight years later, he's living as Father Christmas and loving it. When a hidden ""Mrs"" clause is discovered, he's forced to return to the mortal world in order to find a wife before Christmas Eve; if he doesn't, he'll stop being Santa forever. Plus, to make matters worse, his son has found himself on the naughty list and his workshop is in danger of being turned into a fascist nightmare by the robot replacement he has left in charge. 'The Santa Clause 2 (2002)' is a step down from its predecessor, which isn't all that good to begin with. However, it certainly has its more successful moments (primarily those not concerning a plastic imposter) and it's sometimes rather entertaining in a breezy sort of way. It's nice to see most of the core cast return, too. It isn't remarkable in any real way, but I'd be lying if I said that it never made me smile. It's a fairly decent, if utterly middle-of-the-road, festive flick. 5/10",-1
8,"The Santa Clause 2 is a sequel to the original that was released eight years earlier. Most of the original cast returned to this decent sequel. I had a fun time watching this even though it's rated G. I am not a big fan of rated G movies. But since I saw the original, I decided to see this and I was pleased.Tim Allen returns as Scott Calvin. Calvin is forced to leave his position as Santa because his son was on the naughty list and it's a rule that Santa has to get married. So he goes back to his hometown and decides to fix his life and his son's.The acting is pretty good. Tim Allen and Judge Reinhold provided plenty of good laughs here.Overall, this is a great film that will bring holiday cheer to most people who see this. I rate this film 8/10.",1
8,"The Santa Clause 2 is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a good cast.Tim Allen is back once again as Scott Calvin/Santa Claus and despite the eight year gap between this movie and the first Santa Clause,he steps right back in to this role very naturally,as if he never stopped playing him,and I think those few years gave him time to improve as an actor and do an even better job this time around,he is given a lot of emotional scenes,particularly between him and his love interest,and he shines in these parts,he's in practically every scene as he also plays the villain and it dosen't get annoying to see him constantly for most of the movie.I preferred this to the first one and I know people will disagree with me,but the original is very straight forward,in this there is a lot more adventure and there's a more joyous Christmas feel to it,I love all three Santa Clause movies as they were a big part of my childhood at Christmas time,but this one is certainly my favourite.Its obviously not perfect,but the Santa Clause 2 is entertaining and funny for the whole family and I would recommend it if you're looking for a good Christmas movie. Despite some very successful years as Santa Claus,Scott Calvin may have to give it all up unless he can find a woman to be his Mrs Claus. Best Performance: Tim Allen Worst Performance: Molly Shannon",1
10,"The Santa Clause films are a great and wonderful series of films that are excellent to watch around the holidays! The Santa Clause 2 stars Tim Allen, Wendy Crewson, Judge Reinhold, Eric Lloyd, Peter Boyle, Elizabeth Mitchell, Art LaFleur, Michael Dorn, and David Krumholtz. Tim Allen is excellent in this film. He's hilarious and a very realistic character. Peter Boyle is good in this film in a brief role. Crewson and Reinhold are good in this film together. The comedy scenes are very funny and the Santa Clause special effects are very good. The music is good as well. Really every thing is fine in this film! If you are looking for a great Christmas film and if you like the cast mentioned above that I strongly recommend The Santa Clause 2!",1
9,"For some reason I didn't see ""Santa Clause 2"" for a long time. I saw both the first and the third movies in the theater. I watched those two on video many times before I really got the chance to sit down and watch this movie. I guess I still suffer from the results of the ""Oh, God!"" trilogy. ""Oh, God"" was really good. ""Oh, God! You Devil"" is one of my personal favorites. However, ""Oh, God! Book ll"" is not as good. ""Book 2"" is an okay time killer but nothing more. ""Santa Clause 2"" is the opposite. It's a very funny movie and very sweet movie The bad Santa in this movie is way badder than Billy Bod Thornton's ""Bad Santa"". I watch ""SC2"" ever year at Christmastime.",1
3,"Has there ever been a production company that seemed to care less about the quality of their output than Disney between the late 90s and early 2000s? The first Santa Clause is a funny and imaginative Christmas tale, but this thing is annoying, forced, ugly, and unnecessary. I even like Tim Allen, but I never wanna watch him play a giant sentient doll ever again.",-1

7,"The Santa Clause is a 2002 sequel to the 1994 classic movie The Santa Clause where a man named Scott Calvin(Tim Allen)accidentally kills Santa Clause who fell off a roof and he puts on his coat and he slowly transforms into Santa Clause.This time around Scott who is now known as Santa Clause has to find a Mrs Clause or else he will not be Santa Clause anymore. Back in the real world and Scott's son(played the guy who played him in the very first movie now all grown up) is now a rebellious teenager who vandalizes his school,only for his school principal(played by Elizabeth from Lost) catches him doing it and brings his parents in for a chat about his behavior. Scott goes back to the real world as he slowly changes back to who he was before and when he goes to the school with his ex wife and her new husband he eventually falls in love with his son's principal and learns that she isn't as cynical as she is.Overall I found this movie cute. It may not be a masterpiece but still its an entertaining movie.I loved the effects,the charcthers,the story and I love Christmas in general so overall its a 7.",1
7,"While this installment fails to live up to the charm and potential of the first chapter, it still entertains.The story featured herein is a bit quirky, but still follows according to the initial storyline of the original. Santa must now find a Mrs. to satisfy the Mrs. Clause in the Santa contract, or become de-Santa-fied.Meanwhile, there are problems back in the land of the normal humans, and Santa must, while attempting to find a wife, deal with his son's rebellious behavior, puberty, and an inane husband-in-law.There is fun to be had, but the harder you have to work to find it, the less fun one tends to have due to the work. So don't work too hard, and just sit back and enjoy the sleigh ride by moonlit snow.All in all? If you're a fan of the first one, you may enjoy the second. The kids will, even if you don't. Otherwise, there are much better choices for adult Yule-time entertainment: Mixed Nuts, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, to name two.It rates a 6.6/10 from...the Fiend :.",1

6,Billboard A man inherits a radio station from his father But in order to keep it running he Hosts a billboard Contest and things start unravelling from thereA Very Indie Film Looking (traditionally shaky cam ) and long Drawn out moments once you prepare and can get past that it's a half Decent movie.I thought it was going to be funny but it's more Dramatic it's quite a sad movie if I'm honest a constant Feeling of despair and failure but not a bad watch you've got to be emotionally ready for it in my opinion,1
1,"How did the filmmakers raise money for this high school play quality time waster?

10,"I remember as a child the Billboard sitting contest the occurred in the valley. This movie allowed me to remember that fond memory of watching as my mother and I drove by them on the way to the mall. I really enjoyed the story and loved that many local back drops that were used. The product placement in the movie made the scenes more relatable and authentic. The characters were realistic and believable. I plan to see Zeke Zelkers other movies, In Search Of, and Loggerheads in the near future.",1
1,"I watched this movie knowing about the history about what happened and living a mile from the actual billboard. The acting was ok, but I just didn't have any feelings for the characters. When the people that went up on the billboard were shown very little and that's what I thought this movie was about. Apparently there's a web series about them but I just don't want to invest time into all of this. I will say the shots of the LV were very nice and shows the area well. The rest it just felt like it could've been a 30 min tv show if they cut all the filler out",-1
1,I went to this movie because I remember this contest as a kid and thought it would provide insight into the actual events. In the end other than it being a radio station hosting a billboard sitting contest there is not a single thing relatable to the original contest. So you are not surprised as I was here are some things that seemed off to me: 1. This is based in 2016 and not 1982 as it originally occurred. 2. Four contestants instead of actual 3 and they were a very small part of the movie and from Nationwide rather than local 3. Acting was poor and camera work often dizzying. 4. Changed the timeline in the movie as one point suggesting they were four months into the contest which would be January but yet it was sunny and in short sleeves and green leaves on trees followed by a scene where they say its Halloween. 5. Adding a fake Mayoral election for the City of Allentown when locals know the location of the billboard is not even in Allentown. 6. Several scenes where they make Allentown seem to be run down and suffering from poverty which may have been more accurate in 1982 but does not fit the current timeline. There are many more issues but if you see this and have any recollection of the original events you will be disappointed.,-1
2,"There are several different types of bad movies. Some are big- budget disasters, such as ""Gigli""and because of this, they are infamous. There are disasters that cost very little and were made by filmmakers who thought they were creating decent filmsand ""The Room"" and ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" are perfect examples. But with Bojangles, you've got something differenta bad movie that pretty much sets out to be a bad movie. And, because of this, you might just find it watchable. Most folks won'tbut if you are the type person who likes ""The Toxic Avenger"" or ""Killer Klowns from Space"", then this movie might just be for you.When I began watching the film, the only thing that really interested me was seeing Reggie Bannister in a small role. Bannister starred in all five of the Phantasm movies.lower budgeted slasher films which, occasionally, managed to be entertaining. Here he plays a serial killer who is the father of a super-serial killer, Bonejangles, and you see him dispensing sage advice to his aspiring sonmost of which is completely insane. And, Bojangles himself is insanea supernatural serial killer who cannot be stopped by bullets or most other means and electricity only stuns him. His only weakness, according to his daddy, is his 'wee winkie'.and this pretty much sums up the sort of film it would bewith lots of sex jokes, some gratuitous nudity and a lot of dopey jokes. I could talk about the plotbut is that really even necessary (the answer, by the way, is no!!)? In most ways, the film looks like a group of mostly 20-somethings got together and decided to make a movieeven though few of them had any experience with cinema. The acting, not surprisingly, is pretty rough and the jokes are the sort that friends who wrote the stuff would laugh at but others would just wonder why.why did they make the picture in the first place? Overall, it's not completely awful the film has a few good moments. But these moments are few and the picture is one that I would recommend skipping unless you enjoy self-consciously bad movies.",-1
1,"Just to say, was not expecting an awful lot from 'Bonejangles'. Saw it with an open mind, as always with any film etc, and with a real attempt to take it for what it aimed to be, again as always, had to throw that out there because people on the internet so do love to accuse people of not doing those when watching a film it seems. There is never any bias intended when watching any film etc from any decade and any genre. Despite the poor reviews and that it did not look very good, the premise was oddly intriguing.Even when watching it with an open mind and taking it for what it aimed to be, 'Bonejangles' still managed to be an awful film to me. Want to make something clear as well, did not watch 'Bonejangles' expecting multi-million budget action and such (resent that suggestion and find that insulting), have seen films etc that don't have a high budget but still manage to be watchable or more because other important elements are done decently. People were not expecting that, what they were expecting was something that actually looked and seemed like some kind of effort was put into it. In my mind, 'Bonejangles' doesn't even try.It is a cheap looking film and looks like it was made and shot on a minus budget, the editing being especially haphazard and the villain looks more goofy in look rather than menacing. That though is actually the least of 'Bojangles' problems.More problematic is the way it's written. The script throughout is sheer laziness and cheese, where nothing flows naturally and there is the constant cringe factor. 'Bonejangles' fails completely as both comedy, where the jokes bore and offend rather than amuse, and horror. The horror being ruined by absolutely nothing being scary (unintentionally funny more like and sometimes it even struggles to be that), a lot of obviousness, no suspense and lots of gratuitous parts and elements that seemed to be there for the sake of it and abused.The rare times where there were signs of a story, much thinner than one thinks reading the premise and padded out, 'Bonejangles' is really intelligence-insultingly dumb and borderline incoherent with confused transitions, too much jumping about and a lot made unclear. The direction shows very little, if any, competence. Really hated the characters, not because they were sketchily developed or cliched (they were but what comes next bothered me more) but because they were really annoying and offensive. Like other viewers, have not been this offended by this many stereotypes in a long time, and all the actors overact painfully with really forced character interaction.Summarising, awful. 1/10",-1
7,"Doug (Kelly Misek Jr.) and Randy the virgin (Jamie Scott Gordon) are two police officers and not very good ones. They do manage to capture supernatural killer Edgar Friendly jr (Reggie Bannister...Edgar Friendly was a character in ""Demolition Man""). Edgar is a Jason clone. They must take the killer to Agento (Dario Argento- Italian horror film director) for prisoner transfer...they do so on the night of the curse of the witch Rowena (Elissa Dowling) who was killed in the 1800's and is also a succubus. There are zombies, a prom night scene, homage to ""Deliverance"" Bruce Campbell chainsaw bit, and kids in the woods.The film seemed to touch on many of the horror slashers. This is a camp homage comedy-horror, that was amusing but not overly funny with appeal to maybe a younger audience who have seen the older films.Guide: F-word, nudity (Hannah Richter-TY)",1
3,"While the 2017 movie ""Bonejangles"" from director Brett DeJager and writer Keith Melcher is labeled as a horror comedy, there wasn't much of either of those to be found here. The movie wasn't the least bit scary, and it utterly failed to make me laugh or smile.The movie was off to a fairly poor start, then suddenly they threw zombies into the mix, and I decided to hang around and continue to watch the movie, as I love everything zombiesque. Turns out that adding zombies didn't really improve much on anything here, as the movie just kept on trotting ahead in the same monotonous and generic manner it had previously.The characters in the movie were not particularly outstanding or memorable in anyway; and the serial killer Mr. Bonejangles, well, let's just say that he was as scary as a stack of fallen leaves and had the appeal of a jellyfish. Horrible, just horrible.I managed to endure ""Bonejangles"" to the bitter end. Was I entertained? No, not particularly, but there are worse movies out there. I hoped the movie would pick up eventually, but it never happened.As I logged on IMDb to write this review, I saw that there is a ""Bonejangles 2"" movie. I think I will just smoothly give that movie a wide berth.",-1
7,"Assigned to protect a mythical killer, a police officer and his transportation team get stuck en route within the town limits of a small town cursed by a witch that causes the dead to rise and attack them, forcing the team to release the psychotic killer in their possession to help stop the zombies and get out alive.This here was a pretty enjoyable slasher effort. One of the better aspects here is the genuinely creepy set up for the killer that has a wholly enjoyable air about it. The backstory about the voodoo powers and his family's connection to the mystical powers is a fine touch and has plenty to like about it with the explanations involving why he can't be killed or destroyed which is explained away nicely in the opening that has the information needed to get an idea of who he is. As well, that leads into the other big backstory including the cursed town which goes back to the witch's curse and how that brings the zombies back to life for them to stalk the town on that specific night to carry out the curse. There's also plenty to like here with the films' strong slasher scenes and confrontations. The stalking in the abandoned factory where it takes out the other officers before a stroke of luck captures the creature is a great opening with some atmospheric touches, much like the stalking in the woods where he runs through the campers in the woods which has some great kills featured here. With the mixture of his attack on the town attacking the guests at the reception as well as the zombies outside featuring tons of action and over-the-top atmospheric touches alongside the fun kills on display, the action picks up nicely in this section and provides a great setup to the finale where it brings some fine laughs into things as well. These here are what hold this one up while there are some problems with this one. One of the biggest issues is the seemingly rushed and awkward manner in which this goes about telling all the plot-points and storyline beats because it's shortened running time is wasted on nonsensical matters. There's no point for the extended, drawn-out flashbacks to their backstory in high-school or the bland, tepid romance reconnecting them again to take place in a story like this which forces this one to go through the explanations of the town curse or what happened to the killer in a brief, hurried manner that happens in here. Keeping this one as brief as it is when it has to waste time on unimportant matters while rushing through the important ones is a rather odd yet big mistake to make here. The other issue with this one is the rather confusing and somewhat unnecessary elements that don't have any point here. The storyline involving the flamboyant officer is irritating to watch with plenty of extravagant behavior and motivations that wouldn't be accepted by a real police force. That also applies to the behavior and antics between the two main cops who tend to be given comedic personalities in their cowardice and ill-trained nature for the situation making them highly unlikely to be on the force much less the ones that survived. The last problem is an underwhelming and barely worthwhile finale that offers up no real action, is over so quickly it's hard to know what happened and makes no sense without any explanation as to what happened, tying into the other issue here. These are what knock this down.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Nudity and a brief clothed sex scene.",1
1,"After watching this atrocious attempt at movie making, I was left pondering how something that had so much potential go horribly wrong? Proof is in the pudding, I suppose...The movie opens with Bonejangles doing his thing (and doing it well...)--murdering innocent victims. This particular victim, however, was also viewing a naughty magazine, i.e. ""Juggs and Bush."" You see, as is the case of most serial killers--in movies anyway-- Bonejangles was warned by his father to NEVER be seduced by women; to never look at their bodies because they would control his mind and his ""wee willie winkie"". Skip to two totally inept policemen who are asked to join the search for the killer, and the race is on.This movie could not decide what it wanted to be, so it just turned out to be nothing. When you have main characters who are played as the most offensive stereotypes ever imagined, it is very easy to put people off. The black guy who played his gay character so over the top should be ashamed of himself. Less is more, Ms. Agnes; less is more. As for the policemen portrayed in this POS, god save the town that depend on them. I suppose since the director knew how bad this film was, he decided to turn up the T & A aspect. Didn't help, and neither did those not-so-special-effects.Rated ""R"" for nudity, violence, and disturbing images. The one thing the movie did have going for it was the name of the witch who cursed the town: Rowena. Where's Ernest T. Bass when you need him?",-1

7,"""Lo-Fi"" was a brilliant finale to Season 3, the season's most tense and boldest, and one of the season's best episodes along with ""Elephant's Memory"", one of the whole show's most poignant.Season 3 isn't perfect, with the early episodes having to cope with troubled circumstances, especially the abrupt departure of Gideon/Mandy Patinkin and having to find a replacement quickly, but while there was some initial shakiness (such as the somewhat awkward introduction of Rossi) it did surprisingly well considering. To me though, it was a long way from a mediocre or forgettable season, ""Elephant's Memory"" and ""Lo-Fi"" were brilliant and ""Children of the Dark"", ""Seven Seconds"" and ""True Night"" had many great things.""Mayhem"" had a lot to live up to and had a tough act to follow. Cliff-hangers continuing into the next season, meaning starting with the finale of the previous season and continuing with the succeeding season, have had mixed execution on 'Criminal Minds'. ""The Fisher King Part 2"" was on the same level of ""The Fisher King Part 1"" and two of the show's best episodes, while ""The Longest Night"" (one of the better episodes from personal opinion of the hit-and-miss Season 6) was an improvement over ""Our Darkest Hour"".Even if being superior or equal to ""Lo-Fi"" was not expected, and would have been a big ask, there was the expectation that it would be almost as good. Unfortunately it was nowhere near as good, being a quite good but flawed episode which was a let-down compared to the brilliance of ""Lo-Fi"".There are good things here. Production values are stylish, gritty, dark and audacious, while the music fits very well and has atmosphere and melancholy. ""Mayhem"" does start off incredibly, and does have a good deal of tension (such as the carnage of the bomb, which is superbly chaotic and has urgency, and Morgan's subway scene) and was also moving, actually did care for what happened for Kate which was great for a short-lived character.Intelligent, taut and smart writing always helps, and ""Mayhem"" does have that, and the direction has urgency and spaciousness. The acting is very good all round, actually did think that care and genuine emotion for such a horrible situation was incredibly obvious.At the same time, ""Mayhem"", while not devoid of tension and suspense, does lack the mounting-tension-up-to-terrifying-heights and bold risks of ""Lo-Fi"". Too much of it feels unresolved, some subplots don't feel as complete as they could have been, only showing what happened to only a few unsubs/terrorists and neglecting the others felt like a cop-out and the ending could have been better rounded off. ""Lo-Fi"" had no pacing issues at all, but ""Mayhem"" felt somewhat rushed and like a longer length might have helped.On the whole, not a bad episode, just not to the same level as ""Lo-Fi"". 7/10 Bethany Cox",1
5,"The raison d'etre of this review is to poke fun at the ludicrous ending. You have been warned.If you watched movie serials, you've seen the cheap and shoddy ways the writers save the heros. It's obvious they can't survive the dynamite explosion or chariot crash at the end of one episode, but at the beginning of he next, they've rolled out of the way just in time - or the scene is restaged altogether, so they're not actually at the scene of the disaster.That's what happens here. The bomb in the ambulance goes off (in multiple explosions to convince us It could destroy a hospital) -- and there's no way the hero could have survived. But a minute later he's okay, aving managed to get out in time (without our seeing it, and run well outside the blast radius. Uh-huh.",-1
10,"Without a doubt the best so far. I was on the edge of my seat for the first time with this show. Even though the first 3 seasons were Very Solid TV , but This episode is a masterpiece of action /suspence.10/10 when the average Criminals Mind ep is 8/10
(I still believe Agent Jason Gideon was the best character and its a shame the actor wanted to leave the show, but I start to become emotional with Agent Hotchner and Morgan, I also wait for Reid to re became the hero of this show)",1
4,"It took *ten* months for the second part to air in Finland after the awesome finale to largely otherwise forgettable season 3. You see, the time-slot Crimanal Minds airs was first given to something I can't even remember and then to FlashForward for the remainder of those ten months. As the promo showing Hotch standing in shock near his car after its explosion started to air, fears of this one being another ""The Fisher King: Part II"" started to rear their ugly head. Who the frak green-lights a promo that shows who did *not* die, thus spoiling part of the episode? In the ""Previously, in Criminal Minds"" recap montage, we get, among the main plot progressions of the previous episode, part of the scene where Prentiss profiles Cooper, which, although necessary for those who missed the first part, also ruins a part of ""Mayhem"" for those who saw ""Lo-Fi"", where Cooper was wounded. It doesn't take decades' worth of watching TV to guess that this signposts that Cooper will pull through and Prentiss will visit him in the hospital.The episode proper begins with the scene from the promo. Hotch is singed and suffering from hearing difficulties. A passer-by who identifies himself as Sam tries to help him help Kate, who has been thrown farther away and is seriously injured. Gosh, she might even die! One problem - it's hard to care about a character who was *introduced* only in the previous episode! Were it Rossi, Morgan, Prentiss (Oh no! Not Brown Eyes!) or even Hotch himself, we might care. Since Kate is half British, it's only appropriate to say that we couldn't give a toss whether she lives or dies.Actual mayhem ensues as evacuation takes place and the first response teams are ordered to stay a safe distance away from Kate since Rossi's team thinks the terrorists are carrying out numerous bombings and will then use secondary attacks against the first response team because that's what they clearly were planning in the previous episode. Before any additional strikes are carried out, Garcia suddenly looses communications to the rest of the team. Nice surprise, which ups the tension.Then comes the mistake. Garcia gets to watch surveillance footage of the explosion that took Hotch and Kate down. In ""Lo-Fi"" and the recap, we see the explosion with *no one* behind the car, making us assume that whoever's car it was, they were already inside. However, Garcia sees footage from a reverse angle that shows that Hotch was right beside the rear of the car and Kate was *directly behind the car* when it exploded. Oops! Continuity error! Deduct one point from the total rating.Cleverly, Garcia reviews the footage *before* the explosion and finds footage of the placing of the bomb. Another footage handily reveals that the bomber started lurking about, waiting for the moment to remotely trigger the explosion. Morgan arrives and rushes to the aid of Hotch despite the protests of the man in charge. And just at *that* moment Garcia sees from the footage that after the explosion, the bomber walked towards Hotch, which means that he is Sam. That's two convenient coincides. And for some inexplicable reason, Garcia then manages to re-establish connections to Morgan! How? Obviously the terrorists somehow cut the connections on purpose. All this means Hotch doesn't have to make a Jack Bauer Decision: to help the victim (contrast Audrey with Kate) or chase the bad guy? Not that it matters either way. A paramedic with an overriding savior instinct (unlike his co-worker) arrives with an ambulance to take Kate to the hospital and the bomber commits suicide in the subway after giving his Obligatory Fanatic Martyr Speech. Sheesh, this episode is sliding downhill at an alarming rate. When no other bombs go up, the paramedic's co-worker never shows up, and Rossi's team fails to connect the dots even though most clever viewers already have, the episode starts to look more and more like a new ""The Fisher King: Part II"".Hotch takes the missing paramedic's place and drives the ambulance, but Secret Service is blocking his way. Cue a clichéd ""Please let us in"" speech and the stone-hearted Secret Service guy makes an exception. Not likely to happen in real life. Clever viewers have already deduced that someone of political importance must be in the hospital and therefore the actual target of the terrorists. Meanwhile, Rossi uses the magical Enhance Button trope (look it up) to zoom in on the footage of the bomber, revealing he used a cell phone to trigger the bomb at a precise moment, with the intent of only injuring Kate and Hotch. And finally the cleverest minds of FBI realize what's going on. A textbook predictable finale ensues, where there are no heroic sacrifices or anything other that would redeem this episode. Yes, there is the clichéd ""He got out before it exploded"" reveal. Yawn. So, yet another episode that does not live up to the hair-raising tension of its superior predecessor. And there are more niggles. The subplot of FBI considering to replace Kate with Morgan is left unresolved, with Hotch saying to Morgan that the job is his, if he wants it, but we never hear Morgan neither accept nor reject the job (although the latter *seems* more likely since Morgan has stated he does not want it). JJ's relationship doesn't even get a mention after it was brought to the fore in the previous episode. Worst of all, nobody seems to care that even though it has been established that there are *many* members in this terrorist cell, only three have been found. Ah, there just wasn't enough running time... My vote is 4/10.",-1
8,"Poor Hotch and Kate! Love how worried everyone on the team is about each other. Hated watching the CCTV of Hotch and Kate getting blown up - it looked scarily real. Kate rambling about cinema/movies. I never paid much attention to her when I watched it the first time around as I was too busy freaking out about the BAU team but now I know what's going to happen to her, I feel sorry for her. Morgan on the Subway train ... literally couldn't breathe ~intense~. I love that Morgan's gun has a torch on it ... but what I want to know is why they all don't have one? Oh Morgan and the bomb .. completely OTT but since they usually do realistic but gritty on this show, I can let them off this once. Prentiss/Cooper ... awwh. The thing that bugs me the most about this episode is what the hell happened to all the other terrorists? Clearly they couldn't be found but when they heard that their big, bad leader killed himself wouldn't they try to do something.",1
3,Criminal Minds has a formula and follows it not matter how things end. In this one they discover a terrorist cell with a specific objective. That objective is not clearly stated (sort of) until the end of the movie. Unfortunately there are too many loopholes that are left unresolved. Boo hoo!,-1
3,"*** Contains spoilers ***I absolutely detest the ending of this absolute magnificent episode, here are the reasons why I absolutely hate this episode, why it doesn't make any logical sense (what so ever):1. It doesn't really end: There are still 14 members in this highly organized ""terrorist group"".The FBI or the service service has absolutely NO guaranties that they will not hit another target.No matter what, they are still criminal and should at all cost be brought in for justice, no one is safe until they are caught. The fact that they have managed to bring in the most deadliest bomb maker of all time, really proves in effect that this group is highly capable of gettingthe resources they need. 2. It's VERY and ABSOLUTELY important that they know who the primary target was for theterrorist group. When backtracking this individuals actions, they can learn **** about whyand what that makes the terrorist group ""tick"". This high target individual, for all we now, isstill living under severe threat of being murdered. 3. Why the **** did the FBI group allow the bomb maker to commit suicide!? It is as simple as Yelling: ""Making shot - Left shoulder"", where another person picks this up andYells: ""Making shot - Right shoulder"". This would by all means have neutralized the individualscapability of slicing his throat. This bomb maker can be brought into interrogation, he, mostlikely, holds a lot of information for this group, heck, he might have been the ""master mind""behind all this... 4. No clear information is being given, only vague estimates and hints. The viewer is left withmore questions, than answers. This just **** me off as a viewer. Especially after havingtortured the viewer with a almost ""unhuman"" cliffhanger at the end of season 3. We asconsumers deserves ""closure""... to say the least.They could have easily made a part 3 for this epic, grandeur ""film"". It really stands out, brings a fresh breeze to the rather quite dull recycling they've made so far (besides the rather nice character development).",-1
10,"it takes you through the sequence of amateur actors of originally competing ethnic groups putting on a western play that in part exposes old wounds and creates negative reactions at the last minute then succeeds wildly.It also makes you appreciate just how severe was the genocide there in Rwanda and how the west stood by and watched. The personal stories of some of the actors is explored. For example three brothers live in the same house together as teenagers,there is no-one else left in the family. It was quite moving and never contrived. The filming is well done editing is concise and the realities of the project never overlooked.",1
8,"The episode begins while two privates are deserting from the US Cavalry after a battle. It just so happens that the two are captured by Sgt. Spear while trying to swim a river. Instead of turning the two over to the Major for court-martial, the Sergeant will keep the incident to himself but subject the two to the worse details of the day.While the troops are in Dodge for an evening, the two privates know that Sgt Spear usually gets intoxicated and gets into a fight. So they think they can find a way to rid themselves of the Sergeant.Sure enough Sgt Spears gets into a fight with Festus. During the end of the fight Festus gets knocked nearly out. That is when the two privates find a way to stab the sergeant making it look as if Festus is the suspect. Now Major Vanscoy is in town wanting Marshal Dillon to turn over Festus for charges.I was expecting another episode that featured a rough Major trying to take over Matt's authority like has been played out many times. But this episode was a nice change from the regular leaving a very interesting and entertaining show. Victor French and Carroll O'Connor were nicely cast in this show that was a good watch.",1
7,"As a U. S. Calvary regimen under the leadership of Major Glenn Vanscoy camps near Dodge City, some of the troops are allowed to travel into the town. One of the soldiers, Sergeant Spear, is given to drunkenness and becomes belligerent when intoxicated. A pair of soldiers under the Sergeant's command were caught attempting to dessert, and the Sergeant is using the attempt to force the men to do what he wants, as opposed to officially charging them with desertion.When Sergeant Spear predictably gets drunk, he picks a fight with Festus Haggen. During the fight, Festus temporarily loses consciousness. The two soldiers are watching the action and seize upon the opportunity to attempt to kill the Sergeant by stabbing him.The circumstantial evidence indicates Festus stabbed the Sergeant. To make matters worse, the wound is serious, and there is significant doubt Spear will survive.Major Vanscoy demands Matt Dillon arrest Festus and turn him over to the Major for prosecution. Of course, no one in Dodge -- including the Marshal -- believes Festus is capable of such an act.Will Sergeant Spear survive? Will the Major impose martial law? Will Festus be arrested? Will the true culprits get away with their crime? The answer to these questions will be revealed before the episode is complete.Victor French, who became a frequent Gunsmoke guest over the last half of the series run, is Sergeant Spear in this story. A pre-Archie Bunker Carroll O'Connor fills the roles of Major Vanscoy. French and O'Connor deliver good performances, as they usually did in any roles they played.This is an entertaining episode, but, other than the fine performances by the actors, there is not a lot about it that is truly memorable or outstanding. I think at least part of the reasoning for this is the way the story is presented to the viewer. There is not much suspense to grip the viewer, as we have information that remains a mystery to the characters in the story.",1

His first act is to help subdue and nutcase ex partner from another precinct who threatens to kill the new female detective.

But then it deteriorates into a repetitive chore that ends up overwhelming you so much that you just can't take it anymore. Just run through a bunch of tight corridors and other small areas, kill everything in sight, reach a save/load next area point, rinse and repeat. And that's the whole game.

my score for the 1st episode
7 STARS ⭐
out of
10 STARS ⭐",1
7,"As Grey's spin offs go, this does have a better and closer to home feel. The action is there. The romance is there and offcourse you can expect some love triangles.Story is forming well. I've got good hopes that it will grow into good entertainment. With a wine or beer in hand the evening will not be wasted. It is shot a bit different from other Grey's spin offs but this is it's own show through and through and gives a new feel.",1
9,I love this spin-off. Ben and Bailey are my favorite Grey's characters. They do an excellent job bringing the characters alive and I was in love with them five minutes into the pilot.,1
1,"I had high hopes for this show. I started watching the first episode, and when they went into a fire, they started flashing new POV's every second or less. It was so annoying, I immediately turned it off, deleted the episode and the timer. Hollywood has found an average shot length of 4-6 seconds to work for them. So why did they go to a rapid fire shot concept for this show? Very distracting to watch, not at all a good experience.",-1
8,"Totally fun show. Sure it's not like how it happens in real life but if you want that watch reality tv. Not too sure about those flashes they did. Hoping that doesn't continue, hurts my eyes!",1
4,Fires are behind doors. No discipline or professionalism. I don't think there will be a 2nd season.,-1
7,"In this Virginian story Randy Boone finds a spirited animal trapped in a swamp and
sick with fever. He brings the horse to veterinarian Robert Culp whose skill
is unrivaled but would rather be drinking than practicing his profession.Culp recognizes it as a thoroughbred, but he wants nothing to do with the animal once it's better. At Shiloh his owner Don Barry claims. Barry is the
one who brutalized the horse ansd turned him into a killer. But Lee J. Cobb
with some money aand extra;legal persuasion gets Barry to part with the horse.When the stallion is turned loose he becomes quite the hound running off all the mares from ranches miles around. Most want to shoot him on sight. But
Boone, rancher's daughter Jena Engstrom and finally Culp want to trap and tame him.Some nice performances by Culp and Barry as two men with differing views on the
use and treatment of horses. Good horse story for those who like horse stories.",1
8,"Stirring outdoor drama builds up a healthy sweat and wears its animal rights advocacy on its sleeve. Robert Culp doesn't shrink from the ugliness of alcohol addiction in his portrayal of the drunken veterinarian Orwell, who's too despondent to recognize that the brutalized stallion in his care holds the key to his redemption. The rancher's daughter who loves him, attractively played by Jena Engstrom, is aware of it though as she fights to tame the wild horse and Orwell's wild demons. The big roundup scene weds newly filmed moments to stock footage. The marriage works because the plucky fast riding of Culp, Engstrom and Randy Boone makes their running inserts blend smoothly into the old master shots.",1
3,"This four part series was a major disappointment. For one thing, it does not meet the average person's criteria for either disaster or catastrophe. For another, it provides only scant hard information or visual documentation for the actual failures. For a third thing, the hand waving 'explainers' are labeled but are rarely of a profession related to the technical problems they are hand waving about.
Probably half of the items discussed concern buildings and roads built over unreliable, sliding, or soft subsurface material. These are not really satisfying engineering disasters so much as poor decision making on the part of the funders.
There was a case of a building put together with human leg sized bolts which apparently degrade in place, then break and fall many stories to ground level. How about an example of even one of these broken bolts.
Save your time, save your money, watch something else.",-1
1,"This poorly written series is a joke. Repeticious narration backed up with nonsensical so called experts. It's dificult to take this seriously when their idea of an engineering catastrophe is potholes in a city., with the story backed up by neuroscientists and physicists....what the hell! Stupidity like this show is the reason I cut off my cable in 2001. Tv is just utter garbage nowadays.",-1
7,"From the point of view of enthralling and educating the public this is an extraordinary series.It also hits high spots in terms of variety, pacing and photography, graphics and human content / sensitivity. Should be compulsory viewing for all politicians and senior civil servants, as well as employed and civil engineers and consultants for cases outside their specialisms .",1
7,"The name you have for this show is not that of the team that created it. They call it Massive Engineering Mistakes. So please don't criticize them for channels using the word Catastrophy. Also to other reviewers, you should not comment on just the talking heads since the rest of the show is of high educational value and you will put people off.",1
7,"Being a lifelong native of the Baltimore area, I know a bit both what has happened and what film is showing. S2E7 Sins of Ghost Vegas includes long section on Baltimore sewage.I am very familiar with the massive flood footage they showed. That was filmed toward Catonsville, only several miles from me, and that is the same storm that a second time rubbed out my very nearby Ellicott City in 2016, Memorial weekend, NOT February. Never mind that Catonsville is on the outskirts of the city, not very close to subject Jones Falls and does not empty to it at all. JF goes from north right through the city to the harbor; Catonsville on the west side of the city.Maybe that is not the point, but it really is misleading and disingenuous to conflate images that have nothing to do with the narration. Makes me wonder how much I can rely on the other episodes.",1
3,"As an engineer with 35 years experience, I find their ""experts"" both laughable and horribly cast.",-1
3,Disjointed and scripted commentary by experts from seemingly random fields chime in every 30 seconds on the particular segment. If you're going to give these non-actors a script to read just have one person do it. It's terribly distracting to have five or six different experts give a scripted response about the same thing.,-1
9,What a wonder gem of a series we have here! Production team has spent lot of time visiting these tragedies and looking for clues.Documentary is easy to digest even for a regular person.Great series and waiting for more to come!,1
6,"I'm not a rocket scientist, but anybody who was around when the Apollo 13 disaster happen knows parts were not used from previous Apollo missions. Absolutely impossible! Why you say? Because only and I do mean only the Command Module comes back to earth! With the astronauts and moon rocks, if any, Everything else is either discarded, ie: first stage, second stage, LEM, in outer space. Or burns up in the atmosphere, take note-THE SERVICE MODULE-.A so called "" repurposed part",1
8,"Love the show but please discontinue the background music with the narrative, annoying as hell.",1
1,"As a licensed Professional Engineer with over 35 years of experience, I find this show laughable with a twenty-something girl who is supposed ""Infrastructure Expert"" and a guy who is supposedly a ""structural"" engineer making ridiculous and inane comments like ""...to engineers a 4 inch difference is a lot on abridge like this..."" Really? That's your take on why 35 people died? I would enjoy watching if a ""real"" expert presented factual information on why the collapse occurred.",-1
2,"The basic problem with this show is that there are no engineering catastrophes. There are only management catastrophes. Those who hold the purse strings are totally responsible. Scott Jackson, PhD",-1
5,"Why would anyone consult with a bio engineer on a dam failure? Or a freaking nanochemist on the topic of civil engineering? It's insultingly bad, especially when you consider they had a ""civil engineer"" make some comments on a previous topic of the same episode. Could they not be bothered to have the civil engineer talk about the failure mode of the concrete spillway? Or have the chemist talk about the rusting of bridge supports?
But at least they tell us super important things in the narrative. Like Mr. ""Physicist,"" ""...for engineers this is bridge heaven"" I'm very glad to have had an expert tell me that. Wow. So important to know.
Besides the cancerous ""experts"" the show manages to be a worthwhile watch. The narration is quite well executed and topical, and the technical details of the narrative, while being a bit layman, suffice to document the ""catastrophe"" in question. Overall, a show worth watching while browsing the internet and there's nothing better on - if you remove the ""experts.""",-1
10,"As a Professional Geotechnical Engineer, I'm certainly biased but I think this show is fantastic. The before and after visuals complete with detailed but not overly technical analysis and explanation of so many civil engineering failures - and the resulting effects in the design and construction industry - really brings perspective to your career.",1
3,It's really hard to take people serious that can't keep themselves from physically looking like idiots. Nobody wants to get thier info from somebody that resembles Krusty the clown (corina kwami).,-1
2,"This show would be halfway tolerable if they got rid of the idiot millennial 'experts' from every field under the sun. What does a twenty-something ""neuroscientist"" know about engineering?? A biochemist? Added to which, their resident engineering 'expert' is (forgive me) so astonishingly homely it's impossible to look at the screen (sorry, Corina). Good God, just ditch these spurious 'experts' and give us a decent show. What happened to the Season 1 format? At least that was entertaining.",-1
8,"This takes me back. How to Draw Comics the Marvel Way was an instructional book released by Marvel in 1978, with writer Stan Lee and artist John Buscema teaching aspiring comic book artists how to draw comic books in the style that Marvel was known for. My older brother had a copy and I used to be fascinated with it and watching him use it to try and draw like John Buscema, who was one of my favorite comic book artists growing up.This video, featuring Lee and Buscema, was released a decade after the book and I didn't see it until sometime in the early-to-mid 1990s when I happened upon a VHS copy at the local library. Not being an artist myself, I can't vouch for the techniques shown but I would imagine that even if you completely mastered what you see here, you won't have much luck breaking into comics today as the medium's storytelling has changed so much since then (not necessarily for the better, but I won't get into that here). Anyway, this is still something I would recommend you watch if you're a fan of classic era Marvel comics (1960s through 1980s). It's got a lot of nostalgic appeal and many of you might find the instructional aspects genuinely interesting, even if you can't draw more than a stick figure.",1
6,"Very interesting. The story line seems familiar. Great acting from Randy Quaid. Jeremy Dillion(Quaid)is a high profile serial killer and is scheduled to die in the electric chair. A fluke lightning storm at the exact time of execution leaves the notorious killer a survivor of ""old sparky"". As Dillion recovers from the high voltage, he tries to assure that he is a changed man. Not only does he not remember his past; he has headaches that seems to let him see the future.Very impressive execution scene. Quaid is commanding in his best work in a very long time. This thrilling drama also features A Martinez, Embeth Davidtz and a small role for Clarence Williams III.",1
5,"From almost the opening shot things start to go wrong with LAST RITES . The first scene features a run down cell block circa 1930 then when the story cuts to outside the prison a few moments later we find it's present day America with a TV crew filming a baying mob . One quickly realises that director Kevin Dowling isn't tricking the audience into thinking this is a 1930s prison and that it's more of a directorial blunder . We're then shown a totally realistic scene where both black and white cons take bets in a recreation hall while an execution is about to be performed . Let me get this straight - Black and white prisoners in an American maximum security prison get along fine and no one bothers to lock them down during an execution ! I don't think the producers of OZ have come out with anything so unrealistic , and at least in Oswald state prison the cast give power house performances unlike the inmates here . But perhaps the biggest problem is the script's pace , we have to endure the story set up of Jeremy ( Oh what a butch name ) being being executed then surviving followed by the revelation that he's lost his memory and has premonitions almost until half way through the running time . This slow burning set up almost makes LAST RITES a damp squib and ruins much of its potential Did I say this movie had potential ? It's a shame because once the premise is set up ( Which could have been done in ten minutes ) we have a fairly interesting story featuring redemption with almost supernatural overtones , a bit like THE GREEN MILE without the overbearing sentiment . Despite my criticising some of the supporting cast ( And boy are some of the performances quite woeful ) the three leads of Quaid , Davidtz and Martinez do manage to bring enough conviction to their parts to stop this movie being a complete waste of time . But this could and should have been a much better thriller",-1
6,"What if someone has been truly rehabilitated after being sentenced to death. Do you forget the heinous crimes they committed if they cannot remember them? If they are able to help you solve future crimes will you keep them alive? These are the questions that come up in this interesting film starring Randy Quaid (The Last Detail, Brokeback Mountain) and Embeth Davidtz (Bicentennial Man, Bridget Jones's Diary).He is a convict struck by lightning at the moment of his execution. He lives and can see future crimes. She is the Psychiatrist trying to determine if he should be executed again.It makes you think about capital punishment, retribution, and forgiveness. Great ending.",1
8,"For a made-for-cable TV movie, this one ranks as one of the better ones in terms of plot, characterization, acting and progress of the movie. You are never sure until the end if Jeremy Dillion is really good or just appears to be. I won't spoil the ending by telling you what happened, just suffice to say that throughout the movie, you will be wavering between good and bad, and you will not know until the end. The film builds up a good momentum towards the climax, and I thoroughly enjoyed this, which I might have missed have I not read the cable TV guide and saw this as the best pick of all.",1
9,"Well acted, well directed even though the story takes a few turns to make you think in certain directions.  You really are kept guessing for much of the film as to what really happened to Jeremy Dillon.  There's also some serious political statements underlying parts of this film. 
Definitely a must-see.",1
4,"A made-for-cable exclusive: Last Rites.  Sometimes direct to cable can be a bad thing.  Randy Quaid was pretty good, but, as my sister pointed out, he never plays a sane character.  However, the rest of the cast was for the most part lame, and the story was incredibly predictable.  That means something, coming from a guy who actively tries not to guess what will happen next.  It's more fun to just let it happen.  When it comes out on video, stay away.  Rating: Kind of Lame.",-1
9,"A very good movie, especially for a made for cable movie. The funny thing is I saw this movie by accident. I read the summary of the movie in the T.V. guide, but wasn't interested in it. Anyway I was watching the tube when the movie suddenly came on.I immediately was hooked, and thought the plot was well done.",1
7,"This movie was a pleasant surprise!! When I saw it listed for cable, I thought (mostly because of the title) ""Yaaawwwwwnnn.. another horror flick"". That was the only yawning I did from the time the film opened.
The film tells the story of convicted serial killer Jeremy Dillon (Randy Quaid) who is about to die in the electric chair for the brutal sexual assault and rape of several women. Dillon survives the execution attempt after a freak accident causes the electric chair to malfunction. Dillon is still electrocuted, but survives. Or did he? The Jeremy Dillon that leaves the execution chamber is very different from the Jeremy Dillon that entered it. He has no memories of committing the murders, in fact, everything about the last 12 years of his life is a blank. When confronted with pictures of his victims, Dillon shows revulsion and disbelief at what he has done. And he has changed in other ways too.. The experience has changed DIllon's perception of the world, literally, leaving him with the ability  to see certain events in both the future and past. This movie is more than just a prison movie, and definitely not a horror film. I have always enjoyed Randy Quaid, and he does an outstanding job here. Its not a thought provoking movie, and makes no attempt to make a ""statement"". It will hook you from beginning to end though!! 7/10",1
7,"As far as TV movies go, I was pretty impressed by this movie. I generally avoid them at all costs, but I caught the beginning and found myself hooked by the pretty interesting situation and ideas put forward. My only complaint was that it turned a bit predictable at the very end, although I was left guessing for a while if he was pulling a ""Primal Fear"". If it's on, I'd recommend you watch it.",1
5,"When I looked at the summary for this it immediately screamed X Files at me so I just had to have a look. Randy Quaid plays it just right as the convicted sex killer on death row. Throughout the film he is convincing in the part, and he definitely holds your attention throughout the movie. Unfortunately this film didn't quite live up to its promise, and is nowhere near as well-written as the X Files. However, there was definitely something which made me keep watching, despite the facts that I'd seen it all before, there was a lack of action and I knew where the film was going. The other actors were less convincing, and there was a general lack of characterisation, while the prison staff were definitely just stereotypes, without a shred of originality. Yet it moves along, sucks you into its atmosphere and holds you till the end.",-1
10,"This movie is awesome.  I consider it one of the best I have ever seen in my life.  So many things went through my mind when I saw this movie.  I changed my mind about 3 or 4 times during the movie.  In contrast with what I saw in other comments, I personally think this movie was not predictable.  It creates a feeling of mystery and anger at the same time. This movie was not all fiction, because what happened to Jeremy can happen in real life. At first I didn't think it could, but I asked a doctor and he told me it did. Overall, I really liked this movie and I think it's a great choice.  I fully recommend it.",1
10,"I recently watched this on cable one night, as there was not much on.  I was stunned as I encountered an absolutley brilliant film that I'd never ever heard of before.  What makes this film isn't apparant - the directing, nor the acting is remarkably supurb to the point that it stands out -- it's just that it grabs you, and then the storyline throws you around.I'd recommend it to *Anyone*.",1
9,"This was made-for-cable?  This was a very good movie.Randy Quaid was awesome as serial killer Jeremy Dillon, who undergoes a transformation after his execution in Florida's electric chair is botched (Yes, it IS set in Florida, and they do mention 'Ol' Sparky'. Interestingly enough, this movie was made after an inmate's face burst into flames while he was being electrocuted).  Now, not only does he not believe he's capable of the acts he committed (raping and murdering young women) much less remember them, he can see the future as well.  When his 'psychic' powers lead to the closure of some cases, including the freedom of a friend wrongly placed on death row himself, the public becomes sympathetic.  But can he convince the Governor, the Warden, his psychologist and a victim's advocate (who is the sister of one of his victims) that's he's really a changed man?",1
10,"This is the best for Randy Quaid.  I have seen him in a lot of his movies and he is outstanding in this role.  From the opening scene in the FL prison to the ending scene in a parking lot, you are guessing on what he is up to. Outstanding performances and directing.A MUST SEE!!!!",1
10,"I was so touched by this film. I am a born again Christian and one of the foundations of Christanity is forgiveness. This film really hits home on forgiveness. My friend was murdered by her boy friend in 2004 and in 2005 they gave him life in prison. I would not like to put myself in the shoes of the family, but could I forgive him as a Christian? and if he some how received a gift such as the character in the film and he saves a life or stops a murder from happening could I forgive him? and if he saves my life could I forgive him? I will never know unless it happened to me but I pray it does not.I think this is one of the best films I have seen and I recommend not only do you watch this film but put your feet in the shoes of the family and ask yourself could you forgive?When Jesus was on the cross the same people who put Him to death mocked Him even while He was dying on the cross and with what breath He had left. . . He still said ""Father forgive them for they know not what they do"". . .If I had gone to the movies I would of been happy that I paid to see it. But as it was on TV and it was free I give this film a 9 out 10.",1
10,My uncle Tim wrote this movie. I saw it when it came out and I was about 12 or younger. Rock on Uncle Tim! The movie was better than a made for TV movie. I really enjoyed his story line. He may be my uncle but that does not weight my opinion. I can't wait to see his next script become a movie. I also do not like that this site requires you to write a mandatory b.s. of 10 lines of text. two thumbs down IMDb. Or that attempts to pad your submission may result in your account being blocked. All I need to say is go Uncle Tim!!He has worked on some really good movies so he must know what it takes.,1
7,"When MISS CONGENIALITY came out, I remember how it got lukewarm reviews (at best) and did so poorly in the theaters that it was offered as a free pay-per-view film with the Dish Network. I assumed the movie MUST have been terrible for them to just give it away and I am surprised I actually watched it. To my surprise, however, it was most enjoyable...though mindless (at times).The film is one of these ones that you simply must suspend all sense of disbelief--otherwise it simply won't work. Sandra Bullock going from tom-boy FBI agent to nearly winning the Miss United States pageant was a bit far-fetched to say the least. But, if you can do this and stop your brain from nagging you, you'll find that the movie is often delightful.Now you may have noticed that I didn't say this was a great film or a must-see. The movie did have some rough spots (despite some people giving it a 10, this and very few movies deserve a 10). The biggest problem for me is that the setup for Bullock's character went way overboard. Sure, we are supposed to see her as a tough lady--I understood that. But they really went too far--often making her seem too tough to be real and, at times, unlikable. First, no lady who is built like that is going to be the Terminator....tough, yes, Terminator, no! Second, when she met the character played wonderfully by Michael Caine, it was as if the director gave her instructions to behave like a boorish pig. Seeing her eat with the manners of a Doberman was just too much--no one is THAT obnoxious when they eat (at least once they pass age 6). Third, the transformation was just too quick.Now, aside from these difficulties, the film was a delight at times because although the script had problems, it also had some very witty dialog and a cute resolution. In other words, it worked despite its flaws. Partly this was because when not acting boorish, it's hard not to like Miss Bullock. Partly this was because she had some excellent support. And, partly this was because this is a silly little film and silly little films are not supposed to be Shakespeare or a Merchant-Ivory production--it's allowed to be slight yet fun.Overall, a nice time-passer but far from a must see or a 10, though Bullock still ""scores"". Also, I've seen this one more than once and it holds up very well with repeated viewings despite its few deficiencies.",1
9,"I absolutely loved Miss Congeniality, it was funny warm and completely likable. The best aspect was the charming and funny performance of the underrated Sandra Bullock as Gracie, in possibly her best role. Gracie is a beautiful woman, but her behaviour like the pig snorting isn't very typical of women. She is excellently supported by a witty, side splittingly funny script, and some lovely camera-work. (the painting scene was priceless)Not to mention the original plot that never marred the feel good nature of the film. The performances of Michael Caine and Candice Bergen were excellent. But if I had one minor criticism, it would be that William Shatner slightly overplayed his part of Stan, other than that it is a comedy you just don't want to miss. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox.",1
6,"Gracie Hart (Sandra Bullock) is a rough and tumble FBI agent. She's prone to violent outbursts and manlier than any other agent. When a terrorist threatens the Miss United States beauty pageant, Gracie must gather what's left of her femininity to enter the pageant.Sandra Bullock is a lovely actress. She's great at playing the dorky cute girl. In here she adds a dash of violence and it starts off quite well. Once they transition into the pageant, the jokes don't hit as well. There're too many pratfalls. The jokes are broad and lack any insight. If it wasn't for Bullock's adorableness, there wouldn't be much of a movie. Candice Bergen and William Shatner make a fun pageant organizing duo.",1
4,Miss Congeniality has Sandra Bullock as kick ass Gracie Hart. A FBI agent who prefers to be one of the lads.The unglamorous and frumpy Gracie is gung ho who finds herself going undercover when a terrorist threatens to blow up a national beauty pageant.Vic Melling (Michael Caine) has the task of turning Gracie into a graceful beauty contestant. Gracie needs to find out just who the baddie is but she keeps falling over her high heels.Eric Matthews (Benjamin Bratt) is the team leader who never trusts Gracie's instincts.Miss Congeniality would had worked if the lead actress was really a butch tomboy that would magnificently turn into a swan.I never believed Bullock was an ugly duckling who preferred beers with the boys and getting into fights.This is a loose and frothy action romantic comedy that is not that funny and has little action. It relies too much on pratfalls.Caine does best as the veteran gay pageant coach but the movie is lukewarm.,-1
10,"""Drop Dead Gorgeous"" implied that beauty pageants can make for great humor, but ""Miss Congeniality"" takes it to a whole new level. Starring Sandra Bullock as a sarcastic FBI agent participating in the Miss America pageant to thwart an attack, the movie pulls no punches. I think that my favorite part is when her trainer (Michael Caine) asks her why New Jersey is called the Garden State. I couldn't have come up with a better answer myself! All in all, it's great to see them mocking the Miss America pageant. I agree with a previous reviewer's scathing comments about it (a bunch of stupid models saying how they're going to save the world). You're sure to love this movie. Also starring Benjamin Bratt, Candice Bergen, Ernie Hudson and William Shatner.",1
7,"I saw this when I was in secondary school when lessons were cancelled, and then I saw it again, and it is still good. Basically Gracie Hart (Golden Globe nominated Sandra Bullock) has a no-nonsense and hard hitting reputation and attitude, but when she fails to follow orders, the boss is not too confident she can work properly. But when the cops hear about a killer indicating a target at the Miss United States beauty pageant, they decide that someone needs to keep a close eye on the girls. They decide that Gracie should enter the contest as an ambitious participant, she is obviously not pleased that she has to act more lady like. But Victor Melling (Sir Michael Caine) is going to make sure that she does, oh, and the womanising agent Eric Matthews (Benjamin Bratt) has enough attraction for her to have some confidence. Also starring Candice Bergen as Kathy Morningside, Ernie Hudson as FBI Asst. Director Harry McDonald, William Shatner as Stan Fields, John DiResta as Agent Clonsky; Heather Burns as Cheryl Frasier, Miss Rhode Island and Melissa De Sousa as Karen Krantz, Miss New York. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Song for ""One In A Million"". Very good!",1
6,"I guess ""unpretentious"" is as good a way as any to describe this rather loose-limbed comedy thriller. It has no particular ambition and breaks no new ground. The FBI discovers that some miscreant intends to blow up the Miss United States beauty pageant so they decide to put an undercover agent into the competition. The only field agent available is Sandra Bullock, a foul-mouthed, ill-kempt, ungroomed, violence-prone, tough-minded babe who smothers her steak in ketchup and chews it with her mouth open. She is dragged kicking and screaming through the gelled hair and the bikini wax and the proper way to walk. Benjamin Bratt is her partner and Michael Caine is the fairy who must prepare her in five days for the Magic Moment. William Shatner is the program's stage manager and Candace Bergen is the hostess.The film isn't a failure but it's a one-joke situation comedy dragged out to feature length and adorned with every gag the writers could dream up. After her thoroughly predictable transformation into a stunning, sexy beauty who emerges from the staging area with Benjamin Bratt, Bullock mutters to Bratt, ""I'm in a bad mood and I'm armed, so don't mess with me."" Then she trips on her high heels and falls down. Behind her, Bratt winces. It's sitcom stuff.Some of the gags are better than others. Candace Bergen must explain to Bullock that the pageant is not a beauty contest but a scholarship program and that they've gotten a lot of criticism from certain quarters -- ""feminists, intellectuals -- ugly women."" And, when asked to describe her favorite date, one contestant screws up her face with doubt and says, ""Gee. That's a hard one. I think I'd have to say April fifteenth, because it's not too hot or too cold and you don't need a jacket."" The real problem, aside from the lack of imagination in most of the comic pratfalls, is that the target of this movie is too easy. I think the funniest send up of Miss America was in Woody Allen's ""Sleeper"", in a scene in which his intelligence is being broken down preparatory to brainwashing. Nothing is more hilarious than Woody dressed in a gown, with a steel helmet bristling with electrodes, hearing the announcement that he is the winner. Tears stream down his cheeks as he goes into his ""world peace"" speech. The scene lasts about two minutes. This movie clocks in at about an hour and a half.The ""world peace"" speech is satirized here too, as are all the other features of the stereotype. However, the people behind the curtain don't want to be TOO hard on Miss America because, after all, people WILL watch it and cheer for their favorite. So when Shatner asks Bullock on stage what she's learned from her participation, Bullock responds that she's found a lot of new friends here and that they're not the airheads they're presumed to be and, gee, they're really swell women.That's not what the movie has shown us, however. Miss Rhode Island and Miss Hawaii almost get into a cat fight over whose state is the smallest. And the worst sins they've ever committed are stealing a pair of red panties from a store because their parents forbid ostentatious clothing. They have no talent that can't be found outside of an ordinary high school and no evident thought processes that extend beyond their body sheaths. I mean, as the old saying goes, you can't have your yogurt and eat it too.What worries me the most is that this purports to be a sarcastic editorial on people of this age and class, but it might actually be reportage. Maybe the contestants actually ARE like this, and maybe there are a substantial proportion of the American population that applaud these posturing empty shells and the values they represent.Yet, to say that these characters are fatuous dunces and the enterprise itself shallow, to say all that, a couple of observations still need to be made. The Miss America Pageant (or ""scholarship program"") is too easy a target. It's like breaking an iridescent butterfly on the rack. And are they so terribly ignorant or is this a representative sample? A Fourth of July Poll in 2011 revealed that one out of five Americans couldn't name the country we achieved our independence from. A 2010 World Public Opinion survey found that Americans want to tackle deficits by cutting foreign aid from what they believe is the current level (27 percent of the budget) to a more prudent 13 percent. The real number is under 1 percent. And, let's face facts, some of the wisecracks are pretty witty. And, above all, William Shatner enjoys himself immensely as the pageant's host. He always enjoys himself on screen, the big ham.",1
8,"Grace Hart has always been a bit of a tomboy with a sense of justice so it isn't surprising that she became an FBI agent. Her position is threatened when an agent is wounded after she disobeys orders but when a terrorist known as ""The Citizen"" threatens the Miss USA Beauty contest in San Antonio, Texas she is the only agent who can go undercover as a contestant. It won't be an easy assignment though; Gracie has never worn a dress in her life let alone donned high heels or used beauty products! Once there she is put under the wing of coach Victor Melling and gradually learns what she must do if she is to gain everybody's trust, progress in the tournament and uncover the terrorist.This film doesn't provide too many surprises but that doesn't matter as it does provide plenty of laughs. Gracie is a fun lead character; Sandra Bullock does a great job in the role. She convinces as the tough agent who doesn't care about trivialities like her looks as well as having the looks to convince as the beauty pageant contestant. Michael Caine's performance as Victor nicely contrasts as he does everything the 'correct' way and Gracie needs constant tutoring. There are also fun scenes between Gracie and her fellow contestants and there are entertaining performances from William Shatner and Candice Bergen amongst others. The mystery elements take second place to the comedy but still proves entertaining if not too surprising. It does get a bit silly at times but that doesn't feel out of place in a deliberately light-weight film. Overall this might not be a 'great' film but it is a lot of fun; I'd certainly recommend it.",1
6,"Amusing and entertaining film with Sandra Bullock 's undeniable screen presence . Undercover FBI capable agent Gracie Hart (Sandra Bullock) is a tomboy and foul-mouthed girl . Generally a nice agent , she is in trouble at work when she does an error in judgment in an undercover operation which turns in a disaster. One of her partners named Eric Matthews (Benjamin Bratt) is assigned by his chief (Ernie Hudson) to lead the high profile case of a terrorist nicknamed The Citizen . Gracie pieces together the tracks to determine that The Citizen's next target will be the Miss United States beauty pageant threatened by the psychopath criminal . The pageant administration , led by previous winner named Cathy Morningside (Candice Bergen) and long time host Stan Fields (William Shatner), provide the FBI with access to the pageant, Cathy in particular is less than thrilled to have a non-credible Gracie disguising as a contestant which she feels will ruin the pageant. The FBI enlist the assistance of former pageant contestant consultant Victor Melling (Michael Caine) , he is called in to groom and turn the agent into a beauty pageant contestant. As Gracie proceeds in the transformation, she gets to know the other contestants (Melissa De Sousa, Heather Burns who will appear in the sequel) , not only as potential criminals, but also as real people. She also discovers that another sinister element is present at the pageant. She investigates against the orders of her superior using all the means to find the dangerous criminal . Then she decides to investigate by his own in the contestant pageant and she befriends the beautiful contestants . Firstly she goes undercover to the contestant in San Antonio , Texas , where finds some clues. She tries to protect her new friends from dangerous attacker who attempts to blow up the pageant .This fun movie displays action , comedy, suspense and is pretty entertaining . In spite of some flaws , silly gags and camp glamour the film works well enough for a respectable light comedy with extra doses of amusement and entertainment . Sandra Bullock is sympathetic and funny as untameable tomboy agent , she shows no signs of having any femininity in her demeanor or appearance and her earnest clowning wins audience attractive. Bullock plays as a hybrid among Bridget Jones and Inspector Clouseau characters . Most of laughters come courtesy of her jokes and fights , both physical and verbal . Benjamin Bratt as her tough, brawny colleague is likable . They form a peculiar duo , making a special buddy movie . Lively , jolly musical score by Edward Shearmur and atmospheric cinematography by Lazslo Kovacs . The motion picture is professionally directed by Donald Petrie . The picture will appeal to Sandra Bullock fans. The following is titled ¨Miss Congeniality 2 : Armed and Fabulous¨ by John Pasquin with the same cast adding Treat Williams , Regina King and Enrique Murciano ; it is another Sandra Bullock vehicle and results to be an enjoyable sequel in which appears similar characters to first part . It deals again about the FBI agent Gracia Hart ,nowadays is assigned by her chief for advertising the FBI and traveling throughout the country along with a bodyguard agent .",1
6,"It's over-the-top, it's occasionally offensive--to men, to women, to gays, to lesbians, and to poor Miss Hawaii--but ""Miss Congeniality"" has Sandra Bullock, and she's wonderful. The opening moments, with FBI agent Bullock busting Russians in a restaurant sting operation, are so good that the movie might've played very well as an FBI comedy-drama, with Bullock on different cases. I mean, maybe they should've ditched the pageant stuff, at least until next time. But, no, Bullock goes undercover as a contestant in the Miss U.S. pageant, and the movie turns into your typical makeover thing. Lots of breast jokes, TOO many high heel pratfalls, and Michael Caine as a peculiar makeover artist (he's ""dripping with disdain"" one minute, fatherly the next, then bitter, then cuddly). Bullock has no chemistry with Benjamin Bratt as her boss on the operation (that's not her fault, however) and I wanted more of her home life (and that doomed microwave oven), but what works does work well. Sandra's ""bonding"" paint party with the girls is terrific, as is her friendship with shaky Miss Rhode Island and her attempts to face down snarling Ernie Hudson as the FBI chieftain (who, like in ""Ghostbusters"", gets no funny lines). The movie rests solely on Bullock's shoulders, and she delivers. It may not be comic genius, but it is congenial. **1/2 from ****",1
6,"Believe me, I would be the last one to reccomend Miss Congeniality.  It has a conventional (not Congenial) script, dumb supporting characters (even though I can't resist laughing at William Shatner singing at the beauty pageant) and the usual sitcom drek.  But at least it has 2 things going for it, sandra Bullock who here has more charm and sexuality than ever (even if in parts Mel Gisbon in What Women Want has more femeninity than Bullock here) and it is better than Beautiful, the horrible piece from Sally Field.The story has Bullock as a tomboy fbi agent who has to go undercover as a beauty pageant contender to solve a case.  Basic, sure, but the usual dumb jokes (even if a couple are amusing) and dumb characters bring this film to a bad place.  However, Michael Caine is good for a few chuckles as a ""pageant consultant"".  It isn't the worst, but not really compatable to go up against films liek Cast Away, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Finding Forrester.  C",1
5,"This comedy at times is just plain silly. Gracie Hart(Sandra Bullock)is a tomboyish FBI agent that goes undercover as a beauty-contestant to catch a serial killer. Bullock fills the bill perfectly. She is not exactly hard to look at and slips into comedy real well. A diverse supporting cast that features Benjamin Bratt, Candice Bergen, Michael Caine and William Shatner. Bergen and Shatner a bit over the top, but after all it is comedy. The stars out shine the story line. A don't miss for Bullock fans.",-1
8,"Miss Congeniality is a film that tells the story of a female FBI agent who must go undercover in a beauty pageant to stop a terrorist bombing. It stars Sandra Bullock together with Michael Caine, Benjamin Bratt and Candice Bergen.Gracie Hart is an FBI Special Agent. The FBI learns that there has been a bomb threat against the 75th annual Miss United States beauty pageant in San Antonio, Texas, which the bureau determines came from the notorious domestic terrorist known as ""The Citizen"". Gracie's partner, Special Agent Eric Matthews , is chosen to lead the mission to stop the attack.He acquires Gracie's assistance in the mission despite the fact that she was re-assigned to a desk job for there is an increase chance of success with her involvement in it.Despite of a mediocre screenplay and an unoriginal premise,Sandra Bullock provides a great and memorable performance as Gracie that the viewer finds joy,delight and entertainment in the movie.She manages to carry the film all throughout that the viewer buys into its unrealistic events and fun that it provides.She managed to pull the movie from almost an average flick into a holiday charmer.",1

7,"Miss Congeniality finds Sandra Bullock as FBI Agent Gracie Hart, who must go undercover in the Miss United States beauty pageant to prevent a psychopath from committing untold homicide.The premise is simple, it's a Pygmalion/My Fair Lady scenario that transforms the rough and tough Gracie into a viable contestant for the pageant. Thus we have all the comedy that comes with her literally battling everyone, including her own opinions on pageants, as she is being asked to be something she doesn't believe is in her make up. The mystery of who the killer is who's on the loose is strong for a good portion of film, and even once it's known and drama takes centre stage, it's still hard to get the smile off of your face. The jokes are plentiful, with Bullock finding chemistry with all of her co-stars. She's a very under valued comedy actress, and her ability to bond with an entire cast is marvellous to observe. Reference sexual tension with Benjamin Bratt, the jousting hostilities with Ernie Hudson, the way she bounces off of the other beautiful girls, and best of all the by-play with Michael Caine, who is playing a camp stylist and walks in to lift the laughter roof off the rafters in every scene he is in.It doesn't push the boundaries of comedy, but it's thankfully a consistently funny piece of work, aided by a super cast on form who make a better comedy out of what the screenplay suggested it had any right to be. 7/10",1
7,"Sandra Bullock is clearly having some fun here as the accident-prone FBI agent who is roped into a scheme to prevent an atrocity happening at the upcoming ""Miss America"" pageant. Helped by the camply debonaire Sir Michael Caine as her fixer who manages to pull something of the silk purse from the sows ear, she heads off into this lions den of vacuousness, sexism and silliness led by a wonderfully two-faced Candice Bergen and her amiable sidekick William Shatner. It takes well aimed swipes at just about every stupid, stereotypical and misogynist attitude that surrounds these types of events - but it also demonstrates that many of the participants aren't quite as daft as one might expect. Bullock is on good form, the soundtrack helps a lot too - and as light hearted comedy films go; she and cutie Benjamin Bratt just about pull it off. Don't expect a Pulitzer prize and you might just enjoy it...",1
10,"Sandra bullock in her prime as FBI agent turned undercover beauty pageant contestant Gracie Lou Freebush. The storyline is fairly well developed, the acting pretty good, and the actors well cast. The jokes land well and often. This is of my all time favorites, endlessly re-watchable and quotable ""With all this foil in my hair I'm getting HBO""",1
6,"This film essentially begins with a bomb threat being mailed to the Miss United States pageant in San Antonio by a domestic terrorist who is known only as ""The Citizen"". Naturally, the FBI is notified immediately and it's then that the decision is made to have one of their agents named ""Gracie Hart"" (Sandra Bullock) go undercover as one of the beauty contestants. The problem with that, however, is that Gracie has been a tomboy all of her life and doesn't have a clue about how to act like a lady. So to remedy that a special beauty consultant by the name of ""Victor Melling"" (Michael Caine) is brought in to teach her the finer points of femininity. Unfortunately, this task turns out to be much more difficult than anybody ever imagined. Meanwhile, the further the pageant progresses the less likely it becomes that the FBI will be able to stop the terrorist before he can strike. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a nice little comedy which benefited from a good performances by William Shatner (as the Master-of-Ceremonies ""Stan Fields"") along with the aforementioned Sandra Bullock and Michael Caine. Admittedly, the humor was hit-and-miss at times and the plot was rather predictable at times as well. But even so, I thought the movie was worth the time spent to watch it and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",1
4,"Miss Congeniality (2000): Dir: Donald Petrie / Cast: Sandra Bullock, Benjamin Bratt, Michael Cain, William Shatner, Candice Bergen: Comedy about divert personality with F.B.I. agent Sandra Bullock. She is assigned to go undercover as Miss New Jersey due to a bomb threat. Enter Michael Caine as an image consultant set to get her ready. Major flaw regards predicting the villain, which the screenwriter makes no attempt to conceal. Pointless action opener hits formula full force. Director Donald Petrie is backed by colorful sets but he is dealing with material that has been done to death. The pageant theme was done far better and funnier in the underrated Drop Dead Gorgeous. Petrie previously made The Associate as well as the low grade My Favorite Martian crap fest. Bullock is funny and certainly present humour but she is introduced in a standard opening then we are suppose to believe that she is hot or not due too her outfit. Caine is also a capable actor but his role as the consultant is pretty standard. Benjamin Bratt plays a moron cop who couldn't see past the makeup. He will notice Bullock in the aftermath, which is pretty typical of these films. William Shatner is featured to overact and he does so non stop, as well as Candice Bergen as a former pageant winner who is less of a winner here. Satire of pageants bludgeoned in blatant contrivance. Score: 4 / 10",-1
9,"Sandra Bullock, in her infinite grunginess and masculinity, plays an FBI agent, alongside Benjamin Bratt and Ernie Hudson. When the bureau becomes aware of a bomb threat in the Miss United States pageant, Sandra is sent to go undercover as one of the contestants. She's been sufficiently uglied-up in the first part of the movie, so when Michael Caine gives her a makeover and lets her make her grand entrance in a lavender tube dress, she wows the characters in the film as well as the audience! Miss Congeniality is superbly hilarious, and a fantastic hallmark to the end of the never-to-be-repeated 90s comedies. In this lovely genre, that you can only truly appreciate if you lived through it, there are politically incorrect jokes, hardly risqué sexual innuendo, and underlying old-school values. The very premise that a masculine, ugly woman would have to be given a makeover in order to compete in a beauty contest for work would never get made into a film today. But, in the 90s, it was a great idea, and this film was wildly popular at the box office.Candice Bergen, doing an excellent Martha Stewart impression, and William Shatner, another politically incorrect character, are the heads of the Miss United States pageant, and Heather Burns is one of the airhead contestants. If you really hate Sandra Bullock, you probably won't like the movie. But, if you like her or are neutral, you'll split your sides with laughter. She and her costars are pretty hilarious, and everyone in the audience, whether they're an agent or contestant at heart, will find something to laugh at. Watch the preview, since it's a pretty accurate representation of the film, and if you crack up, you'll want to add Miss Congeniality to your collection. I saw it in the theaters when I was ten, and I haven't stopped laughing since.",1
10,"I have to admit that I wasn't first crazy about this movie. But I watched it a couple of times on television and I still laugh about it. Sandra Bullock is perfect and I can watch her in anything anyway. She is one of the down to earth of today's crop of stars. Well, she plays Gracie Hart or Gracie Freebush (an F.B.I. agent turned pageant contestant) representing my state of New Jersey. I love Benjamin Bratt in the role of the other F.B.I. agent. I love Sir Michael Caine as the flamboyant pageant consultant. It's nice to see Ernie Hudson working again. I love watching William Shatner as the pageant maestro and the multi-talented Candice Bergen as Miss Morningstar. Both Shatner and Bergen are pretty good at their roles in this film. Maybe that's why they work so well together in Boston Legal. This movie has it's moments. I didn't care for the scene which Miss New York comes out of the closet. I felt that was silly and useless. They could have edited it out. Then the guys asked ""Is it okay we say lesbian on television?"" Then the female (let me guess that's she a lesbian too) retorts ""Do you have a problem with that?"" It's kind of the worst part of the film for me and embarrassing overall. But then you get to the crowning which I can't imagine a funnier moment in the film which I won't spoil for those who have yet to see it.",1
5,"THE CONSPIRACY is a familiar kind of found footage horror movie that has a decent premise at least. A couple of documentary filmmakers decide to make a movie on a renowned conspiracy theorist, who believes virtually every weirdo theory there is going, but before long they soon come to believe that they've helped uncover something very sinister indeed. The first half of this film is well-founded and believable, laced with the kind of Illuminati theories that are the bread and butter of half the internet these days. The second half becomes more predictable, with a climax that's mildly reminiscent of that of KILL LIST, except not as intense.",-1
5,"In July 2011, Aaron (Aaron Poole) and Jim (James Gilbert) are filming a documentary about local conspiracy theorist Terrance G. The man seems to be a newspaper-clipping recluse but there are plenty of people willing to agree. Everybody has their own crazy theory. Then Terrance disappears and Aaron becomes obsessed. They uncover a secret society called the Tarsus Club.I like the idea but I wish the filmmakers made more with the story. It's a low budget Toronto indie. It has some potential but it takes a bit too long with the paper clippings. There should be some men-in-black earlier. It needs to get from talking about conspiracy and dive into the conspiracy quicker. The hidden camera bit is more effective than I would have predicted but it lasts too long.",-1
5,"A sort of Documentary on conspiracies. A nice idea that starts off pretty nice too. Obviously based or taken from all the found footage films around this tries to cash in to that too. But the guy who made the movie did his research. There are always events that make people wonder if there is more to it.This movie especially at first tries to handle those ideas as what they appear to be: Crazy talk. But of course then it evolves and things are not as clear as the appear to be. Or are they? The movie will not give you clear answers to all the questions, which might be something you like or hate. It was interesting to watch and even with clichés and foreseeable results a well done movie overall.",-1
7,"A documentary about conspiracy theories takes a horrific turn after the filmmakers uncover an ancient and dangerous secret society.Although this film is fiction, it could in many ways just as well be fact in how it explores what opening our minds to conspiracy theories can do to a person. Starting with 9/11, chemtrails, Bilderberg, and many other angles, they then switch to the Tarsus Club (with an incredible online campaign to support it).This was quite enjoyable and a clever idea. Highly recommended for any conspiracy, thriller or horror fan. As of July 2014, it is available on Netflix and well worth seeing there or wherever you can find it.",1
9,"I wouldn't call this a horror movie even though when you think about the lives we live as slaves for the rich it could be interpreted as horror. I thought the movie was really good with some truth elements for sure in it. Conspiracies about high placed people orchestrating attacks on their own country to provoke wars is obviously the truth. People that don't believe such things are just the sheep and slaves of this society. The elite allowing making movies like this is just all part of their plan of minimalizing the whole thing. And that's why the end of the movie was a little absurd for real life events. Just to make the whole movie look like fiction. The first part of the movie is more a documentary then a movie to me. I'm a believer of 70% of those conspiracies. There is no God or whatever. All religions and Gods are been created by the rich and by governments in order to scare the common people, to maintain the public order by fear. That in this time and age people are still believing in a God says enough about the intelligence of some people, and says enough about the well executed plan thousands years ago. Very good movie to me.",1
7,"It seems to go without saying that lately everyone rips on 'found footage' films which are basically shot on hand-held cameras and have people running around shouting directly into the lens. The Blair Witch Project started it all off (if you discount the 'Cannibal Holocaust' movies from yesteryear) which was widely regarded as a modern day classic, however, since then, we have had too many similar clones to take the genre seriously any more.However, 'The Conspiracy' actually chooses a - slightly - different route, by not having any supernatural element in it. Instead, it focuses on a couple of young video journalists who are filming a documentary on a conspiracy theorist. Then, when he goes missing, they discover there's more to it than meets the eye.As with most found footage films, the acting is pretty good, but, what sets this one apart, is its air of believability. Because there are no witches or dinosaurs and you can relate some of their conspiracy arguments to what we've seen on the news, you actually start thinking about the world around us. Yes, this film is very much a work of fiction, but there's enough to it that's based on real life to get us questioning why the 'powers that be' do what they do.If you're one of the few people who actually like found footage films, then definitely watch it. However, even if you don't like that sort of film and you just like decent thrillers then you may enjoy this one, too.",1
2,The Plot.A documentary about conspiracy theories takes a horrific turn after the filmmakers uncover an ancient and dangerous secret society.Another found footage-ish movie. For the life of me I do not understand the reasonably good reviews. This movie is atrocious. The acting is horrendous and the script is worse.The directing is amateurish.I was bored out of my mind.,-1
9,"This was a movie that I've heard pop up on podcasts, but not often. Not surprisingly, it has been doing so more often which makes sense in the current climate of the world. It is interesting that I just heard it reviewed recently on Exploding Heads as well as Duncan covering it over on Where to Begin with Found Footage/Mockumentaries. That is the reason I finally watched it, but it was one that I did want to see from what I heard about the movie. The synopsis is a documentary about conspiracy theories takes a horrific turn after the filmmakers uncover an ancient and dangerous secret society.As the synopsis states, we are following 2 documentary filmmakers. They are Aaron (Aaron Poole) and Jim (James Gilbert). The former is a bit lonely and actually wants to live off the grid. We get to see an interesting scene with him later on at a birthday party for Jim who is married with a young child. Aaron wants what his friend has and it is depressing to see on the outside looking in on this 'perfect' family.The documentary kicks off with a quote from Benjamin Disareli about not knowing who actually governs us. It then is showing us the conspiracy theorist that starts it all by the name of Terrance (A. C. Peterson). He's on the sidewalk with a bullhorn protesting the rich and powerful. He also is pushing that we have an illusion of freedom. We then learn that they wanted to do this documentary not on conspiracy theories, but the people who believe them.To set the stage here, Aaron receives a clip about Terrance. What shocked him wasn't the clip, but that all the comments seem to agree with him. They seek him out and that starts everything. Aaron gets sucked in though when Terrance goes missing. He starts to look for a pattern from the items that were left behind. When he does, it leads him to a group call The Tarsus Club.This group seems to meet before major things happen and are elites from all over the world. There isn't a lot of information out there about them, but it does lead our two filmmakers to Mark Tucker (Bruce Clayton) who once wrote an article about the group. The deeper they get into this, the more Aaron gets sucked in. Jim isn't as thrilled and is scared for his family. Regardless, he does help his friend try to uncover the story here and it could change their lives forever.That is where I'm going to leave my recap as I don't want to go into more spoilers than that and it gets you up to speed. The first thing in favor of this movie is the sub-genre and the reason that I watched it. This movie starts and feels like a real documentary. It is also one that I could really get into as well. Personally, I don't believe in conspiracy theories, but much like the filmmakers, they fascinate me along with those that get sucked into them. The woman who at first I thought was a doctor does point out some really good things about how there is a correlation between this thinking to paranoid schizophrenia. The biggest thing I took from that, they create something that you cannot disprove which just reinforces their belief when you cannot.I want to move from this idea to Aaron. What I find interesting is that he's the one who is contacted about this. I love the subtle things the movie gives to us about his back-story. He's a loner. He has Jim, but he has his family where Aaron really doesn't. He has connected with people online to start an off the grid farm in northern Alberta. I love this idea for him because he isn't that much different from Terrance who goes into this conspiracy theory virtual chat room. They seek out those that are like-minded. It is also fitting that he starts to see things and finds the pattern much like his older counterpart.What I also want to give credit to this film would be with the writing and the editing. There are subtle lines that are dropped throughout this that come into play later. A big thing is with Mark during an interview. The two ask him why he could publish his article in Time and his explanation made so much sense. It also does with some reveals later in the movie. This is made even better by Easter Eggs in the credits. What I also like are different images and speeches edited in that could be referencing what is being said here. That helps to build even more on the realism of that this movie needs.Where I think I should go next would be the acting. I don't think anyone is great here, but they don't have to be, they just have to be believable. I can buy that Poole is his character. I can feel his loneliness and the more that he gets sucked into this conspiracy theory, the worst it gets. It feels real to where things end up. Gilbert also does a good job at being this guy who is interested, but not to the same degree. I can feel his fear too. Aside from that, everyone else does a solid job with shout-outs to Clayton and Peterson in their important roles.Then really the last things I want to go over would be the cinematography, effects and sound design. Having this filmed as a found-footage documentary is perfect. It feels like we are a part of it. Even more so that people's faces are blurred out to protect the filmmakers and those being filmed without their permission. We don't get a lot in the way of effects, but this is more about suspense so that works. Finally the sound design is good. We are getting mostly diagetic sound. That adds to the realism, especially at the climax. There is a horn there that unnerved me. There is music added in, but that works as we are seeing the edited, final product so I can buy it.In conclusion here, I really like this movie. Seeing the world of conspiracy theories and how deeply people can get sucked into them is frightening all by itself. Where this movie takes it is even more. I think there is some genius writing here and edited to really help with that realism. The acting also helps along with the cinematography and sound design. This movie just resonates with me. I'm probably coming in higher than most, but this is a great movie in my opinion. It won't be for everyone, but if you like some of things I've said, definitely see this.",1
5,"After the mysterious disappearance of their conspiracy-nut subject, two documentary makers uncover his pet theory. But what is really going on? The first half is brisk and on-point. The direction and editing are spot on with the internet details of themes about big government cover-ups, which are still popular today, 7 years later. The acting is solid, and the profile of their subject is well done.Then the mystery disappearance. Hmmm. The conspiracy urge transfers to one of the film-makers, and we lose track of the original guy and all the effort to build his character is thrown away. I thought they should have gone down the track of a missing-person hunt. Instead they focus on tension between friends, when they could have done both.The sequence where the black SUV pursues the heroes is genuinely tense. But the third act is a bit Hammer horror c.1960, and the punches are pulled at the end. Didn't really notice the sound or music, apart from the booming drums that came out of nowhere during the ritual.This was all devised before the banking cartel bared its fangs in 2008 and tore the last shreds of aorta out of government ofthepeople-bythepeople-forthepeople - bad timing, dudes! Overall, good entertainment that ends in cheese. I'm sooo tired of the caricatures of the genuinely nasty people who pull the economic strings in our declining society. Come on, film-makers: strap on some bull balls! Walmart is Hollywood's biggest client.",-1

Clips from an interview with a psychiatrist sprinkled throughout the film are another grounding mechanism, and a warning of bad things to come.The pair manage to get into a meeting of the Tarsus Club.

Afterwards, Jim gets to go to a recorded meeting with an official of the Tarsus Club. The spin or the truth? Which one gets delivered more by the film?-----Scores-----Cinematography: 5/10 The film is filmed in both hand-held and more standard camera techniques. The found-film part does not add anything, but does subtract a bit. The segment concerning the Mithras cultist meeting was particularly visually poor. The vignette filter cut off a chunk of the screen; faces were blurred out; over all resolution was VHS-style grainy; the smoke was good at cutting down on clarity.Sound: 6/10 Adequate; I can usually understand the dialog. Voices were disguised during the outdoor initiation meeting of the Tarsus club.Acting: 5/10 Giving the benefit of the doubt.Screenplay: 6/10 The ending ties together the rest of the film nicely.",1
8,"The Conspiracy is a film that the conspiracy buff inside you will absolutely love. It's a thriller from Canada- shot in Toronto- that is constructed as a pseudo-documentary, with a found footage element, and a Whicker Man or Kill List twist. NBC has since purchased the rights, so a spin-off series is to be expected in the near future.It tells the story of two documentary filmmakers who were making a film about a seemingly mad, street-ranting conspiracist named Terrence. Terrence is a lot like Mel Gibson's character in Conspiracy Theory. In fact, the whole first part of the film is really quite similar to Conspiracy Theory, in that Terrence ends up disappearing after he is targeted by powerful and secretive forces for uncovering a vast conspiracy so important that his ""silence"" is required. It strays from the aforementioned film, however, in the sense that we end up following the two filmmakers on their quest to uncover what happened to their subject, as opposed to following their subject through his experience.The whole thing is quite cleverly written. It incorporates a number of real conspiracies- that have garnered high levels of support from various segments of the public- and fashioned them into a believably convincing web, that aligns with the ultimate, all-encompassing theory which sits atop the conspiratorial hierarchy: the formation of a one-world government under the auspices of a secret cabal of high ranking corporate and political elites.The conspiratorial rantings of the characters are juxtaposed with real news footage and real speeches that are often cited in the conspiratorial realm as evidence of the existence of said conspiracies. Such conspiracies have become so ingrained in our collective consciousness, that it's hard not to believe them. Especially when they've been compiled so convincingly.MacBride successfully manages to exploit this phenomenon for the sake of storytelling...and our entertainment.When the two documentarians are unable to reach Terrence- finding only an empty, ransacked apartment- Aaron decides to grab hiss ""work"", so that he can attempt to piece it together with hopes of finding out what he was researching, and in turn, what happened to him.His investigation convinces him that their odd friend was actually onto a very real conspiracy- and that he must have been targeted because of it. Further investigation reveals that his research concerned a Secret Society based off an ancient Mithraic Cult: the Taurus Group. Word is that this group holds an annual retreat during which a ritual hunt takes place...alongside the formulation of global policy and planning of world events, of course.After finding an article discussing this secretive group online, the two men dig deeper and connect with an eerie personage who provides them with ""inside"" information about the cult. From here, they plan to go undercover and break into the group's retreat. They want to discover what really goes on in there for themselves: Is this just a bunch of rich white men networking? Or is something more sinister afoot? This aspect of the story is, itself, ""based on"" real conspiracy- that of the Bohemian Grove (which actually gets a mention in the first part of the film). Like the ""deep-throat"" character in the film, a journalist in the 1970's did actually wander into the redwood forests of California during one of these infamous Bohemian Grove retreats. Writing an article about his experience for a prestigious media institution in the process. Like in the film, this article was the only known source of information about these secret retreats, regularly attended by the elitist of the elite. That is, until people like Alex Jones started breaking in and trying to record their ritualistic undertakings (like the ""Cremation of Care"" ie. ritualistically burning the effigy of a baby before a giant owl statue) with a hidden camera.As was previously mentioned, MacBride concludes the film with a Whicker Man, or (more recently) Kill List, twist. This reference- to one of the most infamous and recognizable horror film-endings of alltime- perfectly compliments the lead-up, and should satisfy both the conspiracist and cinephile horror fan in you.While not incredibly original, this horror veiled as a thriller will certainly keep you entertained. If you are at all interested in the realm of conspiracy, or just enjoy a cleverly compiled and- as some will surely argue- ""educational"" experience, then you should get a kick out of this film. It's definitely worth checking out.7.5 out of 10.Ps. This is NOT A FOUND FOOTAGE film. There is a found footage element (ie. footage from Aaron's hidden cam), but Jim clearly submits to the cult and acts as their mouthpiece, as is outlined by the deep-throat-like character (who you can also assume is from the cult) earlier. This relates to how they often let information leak out so that they can control the message...and as a warning for anyone else who might be thinking of investigating them.",1
10,"""The Conspiracy"" is a fictional documentary that plays out like a found- footage soliloquy. The film comes from Christopher McBride who wrote and directed. It stars Aaron Poole, James Gilbert, Ian Anderson, Peter Apostolopoulos and is quite frankly the most brilliant found-footage styled film to come out in a long while. The story follows two friends as they document their attempts to document a conspiracy theorist. Soon they become a deeper part of the documentary than they intended as things begin to get a little more real than they previously believed. Soon an ancient plot to control and dictate world societies by a super secret society is revealed. The story in ""The Conspiracy"" was a pretty captivating conspiracy theory that flowed logically and seamlessly. The use of actual known prevailing conspiracies, that run rampant on the net along with one of the darkest known cults of human history, amped up the commanding plot. The style in which ""The Conspiracy"" was shot played out like a true documentary with softer moments of commentary and reflections from the characters, this created a more emotional connectivity for me that sometimes is lost in found footage films and actual documentaries. The fact that this film plays out as a believable documentary with a convincing conspiracy theory, and does so with very little flaw, is a testament to what can be achieved with the subgenre if care and consideration is taken into account. I honestly believe the conspiracy exposed within this film-even though I know it is a fictional film-it hit all my conspiracy theory nightmare sweet spots!The drama and suspense is the man drive that moves this film forward, relying totally on the acting and camera tricks to create the intense melodrama from start to finish. It works great in ""The Conspiracy"". The dialog flowed effortlessly and came off genuine. It didn't feel really forced or over scripted. The main star is the actual conspiracy itself. It is a major player in the real world online conversations and framed by one of the most interesting and aloof cults that ever existed. The Mithraic cult of ancient Rome. You can (not that I have entertained such notions-yet) literally red-line the connection between events, religious backgrounds of people of power, Mithra origin story and cult beliefs to the point of paranoia. It was done in the film with eerie, believable implementation. I left the film with just a bit more fear and paranoia about the world around me, even questioning the truth of conspiracies as well as the truth presented to me by educational tools offered in our society. ""The Conspiracy"" is a true horror story but if gore and standard creep affair is your thing then this film may leave you feeling a bit empty. However if you are a fan of any type of horror, and enjoy being taken on a thrill ride through story-regardless of the amount of blood splatter or grue-then ""The Conspiracy"" will deliver 100%. The clever ways the film is shot using innovative camera tricks in ways that haven't yet been over indulged in the found footage subgenre add the chilling suspense. The film really does prove that there are still some pretty stellar stories left to be told and found footage is still a viable means to tell those stories.",1
9,"I have always been a huge fan of conspiracy theories and anything related to the hidden truth out there whether it is some Templar stories or secret societies....Unfortunately, most of these conspiracy films are identical to each other and always follow the mainstream trends such as 9/11, the all seeing eye, moon landing and so on..This movie is something completely different, something that I have never heard of or seen before. It uses actual articles and names that can be found on the internet... if you dare to do it after you have finished watching the movie.One string point about the movie is the way in which it links a documentary to a thrilling investigation that will make you think twice about asking questions that should not be asked...",1
10,I enjoyed this movie because it basically brings to life second thoughts about what we're going through and what type of oppression we could possibly be under. This movie was enjoyable and is a movie that gives you a feeling of nervousness and thrill and excitement. This movie definitely had me shaking in my boots and definitely gave me a life lesson off of this movie. This movie actually made sense in a lot of ways and made a non-conspiracy friend of mine totally start asking questions. I thought the characters Jim and Aaron needed to stop trying discover so much information because that could get them in trouble basically and I would have had a limit of how much I wanted to know. I felt bad for Jim because he looked like he might have ruined his wife's life and who knows if she would stay with him. I would love to see more movies like this.,1
8,"The Conspiracy is about exactly what the title suggests: conspiracies. From 9/11 to the New World Order to occult rituals between world leaders, The Conspiracy wraps it all up into one incredulous story that is documented as realistically as possible. Real footage is mixed in with false claims, blurring the lines of reality, and one of the lingering themes in the movie is the fact that it's easy to dismiss conspiracy theories but it's impossible to disprove them. It's a fantastic concept for a horror movie and it's executed as barebones as possible - we're on the journey with these reporters, and you better be ready for one hell of a ride.The first half is mainly setting the foundation for disbelievers. The cameramen begin as skeptics, then one of them starts to believe, then one of their contacts goes missing leading them to believe he was taken by the same syndicate they're researching, then they become even more determined to find the truth. It's similar to The X-Files in the searching for truth aspect, but it's far more dark and sinister. The syndicate here want the world to be run by one government, birthing the New World Order, and actual presidential speeches are cut together to make it as credible looking as it can be. No matter how skeptical you are, it's easy to get lost in the mindset of, ""Hey, what if this were true...""I'm not going to spoil anything because the less you know the better. I will say that the third act is an absolute roller coaster, but the whole is truly greater than the sum of its parts. It's an exercise in the underground; the occult; the ""what ifs"". Some interviewees are masked in anonymity - blank faces and robotic voices - multiplying the creep factor by a hundred percent. Again, from the documentary-style filming to the expertly edited real footage, The Conspiracy blurs the lines between reality and fiction to the point of probability, and there's nothing scarier in horror than not knowing what is true and what isn't.",1
7,"Aaron and Jim are documentary filmmakers who become fascinated by a street preaching conspiracy theorist. A man who spends all his time spreading a message, like a modern day prophet, about how we are all slaves and the world is run by a group of rich men who are connected by secret societies. When this man suddenly vanishes, Aaron begins to study the clues the missing man left them and believing in the conspiracy as well.Anyone familiar with the dark side of YouTube will know what this film is exploring. It's a mockumentary with elements of found-footage horror that touches on as many different conspiracy theories as possible but eventually focuses in on a particular secret society.The Conspiracy is a perfect horror story for our times. Don't expect an average horror film, this is Blair Witch Project meets Eyes Wide Shut. The writer/director, Christopher MacBride, fearless dives into the frightening subject matter and keeps the film as real as possible, working well within the small budget. The film is quite an accomplishment in more ways than one.",1
4,"While the ending is where all the excitement is, the lead up is a slow 65 minutes of clichéd genre tropes. 'The Blair Witch Project' succeeded as a found footage, because it built up tension throughout the whole movie, and brought a harrowing and memorable ending; 'The Conspiracy' does neither of these. There are far better found footage movies out there (even though I am very anti-found footage), most notably 'Noroi: The Curse', 'The Blair Witch Project', 'V/H/S 2', 'Clover Field', and 'Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon'.Full Review at: http://www.simplefilmreviews.com/2014/07/the-conspiracy-2012_30.html",-1
8,"Thoroughly enjoyed this found-footagey movie. Story was great, acting was on par, camera work not too nauseating. Loved the mystery and the twist. Recommend to anyone who enjoys indie movies with a unique little story to tell. Don't be put off by the found footage aspect. It really works in this one.",1
8,"This is how you make a low budget movie-lean, to the point and not a moment wasted on Hollywood crap. If Hollywood redid this one you need to change the leads( at least one strong female lead) and give her a love interest (likely a black guy) and throw in a CGI car chase and a shootout and then you can get the funding.Anyway, they made this one 10 years ago and it is time for them to do a sequel as the last 10 years has given them lots of ridiculous nonsense peddled by the likes of the ""Tarshus Club"" and their minions.",1
3,"'The Conspiracy' (2012) promised much and delivered disappointing results. Basically these two American guys begin a documentary about a local conspiracy theory nut and discover that he's not wrong about a very private club for world leaders which sets global policy. They attempt to infiltrate it and complications ensue. It started off well but ran aground about a third of the way in, whereupon the plot holes and predictability of the storyline became painful distractions. It was all far too easy for the guys to get inside the club and blindingly obvious what was going to happen. Ah well, things don't always do what they say on the tin. This 'shaggy dog story' was like one of those notoriously misleading 'serving suggestions' on a pack of risotto; you order what looks to be a banquet and you get served up a snack.",-1
8,"This proved to be one of the most surprisingly effective thrillers I have seen in recent memory. At a glance we have an unknown first time writer/director in Christopher MacBride matched with a relatively small budget of just under $1.2 million. Maybe I'm wired a bit different than the average film addict, but when I come upon a new indie film like this my anticipation for the result is much greater than say your average Hollywood blockbuster. Finding greatness in the unknown is what drives me as a fan, while it doesn't always pan out, nothing beats when it does, as this film proves to.The Conspiracy starts off at a somewhat slow pace as we are introduced to the main characters Jim (James Gilbert) and Aaron (Aaron Poole), two documentary filmmakers who are out to make a film not unlike many you may already be aware of. It's theme based on the age old conspiracy of a worldwide secret society of powerful, wealthy individuals behind such things as staging events to start wars such as WWI, Vietnam and 9/11 Iraq. They become interested not so much into the truth of such conspiracies, but in the people who so adamantly and wholeheartedly believe in them. They find Terrance (Alan C. Peterson) through an internet link, a man who is exactly one of those people. His house is covered in news articles connecting everything and anything that could possibly be evidence in his search for his desired truth. After Terrence goes missing and his landlord is disposing of his possessions, Jim and Aaron take Terrence's research from his apartment walls and begin their own quest to find truth within the mountain of information. After finding the existence of a secret group called Tarsus, they make contact with one of it's members Mark Tucker (Bruce Clayton) , who later gives them access and a chance at finding and filming one of their secret rituals. The first half of ""The Conspiracy"" can appear deceptively mundane. Do not make the assumption that this is just another propaganda film filled with unconfirmed speculations. The last act is the real deal, it's as chilling as it gets. The score pulls you into the scenes as the true reality of the events is slowly revealed to each of the characters. Their mini spy cams give off a perspective from their eyes that really pays off. For a small budget indie film from a first time writer/director it was an extremely original, effective thriller which I would surely recommend. One thing I should note though, while listed as a thriller/horror film it stays mainly within the confines of a thriller, replacing needless gore instead with a very sinister atmosphere, which proves to be a worthwhile trade.",1
10,"Did you ever want to write a totally awesome horror movie where the audience, riveted in horror, could not tell if it were a real documentary or the product of someone's messed up imagination? Watch this and learn, kidz. This movie is a model of extremely intelligent writing and execution. This movie deserves a friggin Oscar, and I never say that about any movie.I would give this more than a 10 star rating if I could. It deserves 15 stars. This movie is off the charts awesome. Buy it, buy it, buy it. No seriously. I have never been so grabbed by a movie before, and that's saying something because movies don't normally command my attention. I was pulled into this one and then some. I'm a total skeptical cynic (I don't subscribe to ANY particular theory, let alone a conspiracy theory), but this movie had me to jumping off the couch and practically in tears in the end. It is that well done.So, if you have two brain cells to rub together; and if you're sick and tired of the usual immature gore fests and torture pr0n crap out there, this movie will be a real treat.I have no idea how anyone can rate this less than a 10. But then, I have no idea why found footage haters keep watching found footage movies just to give them bad reviews at this site. Common sense is, if you don't like the genre then don't watch it. I enjoy sci-fi, thriller, and horror. I am not a comedy person, so I don't watch comedies. I don't keep watching them just to crap on them on IMDb.Dear Christopher McBride - I hope you make more movies and do not listen to the bad review clowns here. You made a masterpiece and it's not your fault that people are so dense they can't appreciate the talent and ingenuity that went into this movie. You deserve so much better than the rating this site has given you so far.",1
8,"The build up was good, the ending even better, loved every bit of it - poor Terrance and Aaron....",1
5,"Is this supposed to be a faux documentary based on actual events or just a movie? if it's a movie, why the need to blur the faces and voices? If it's a faux documentary, what are the ""actual events"" talked about or simulated and why again the need to cover faces and voices? Looks like a faux documentary-like recasting of SOME ""actual events"", so it I am not at all convinced about its veracity, particularly as it focuses on only one group among the many in existence for conspiracy loons. ""Tarsus"" looks like a legit giant business corp. having nothing to do with Mithraic mythology. Weren't the movie creators worried about possible defamation of Tarsus with this film? Also, (c) by Mithras Films, Inc. at the end? Wth? This makes it look like a specifically published false impression BY the very group these reporters are investigating. That's a little absurd. So, many little inconstistencies that eventually confuse the viewer about this film's impression and purpose and detract widely from any ""actual truth"" of the matter. -1 for picking on only one such possible group (imaginary or not). The preliminary stuff about general conspiracies is basically irrelevant to the later focus and is nowhere documented. -4 for all the other inconsistencies taken together. Decent for conpiracy fans, but otherwise boring and inconsistent. Watch The Blair Witch Project (1999) or Regression (2015), instead. At least in Blair Witch you know it's just a faux ""found-footage"" documentary, so you will not be confused in advance about the film's intentions.",-1
6,"This stands out from the pool of found footage movies because it is pretty well made in terms of production quality, has an interesting plot, and is just unique in its premise. Not a bad watch for sure.",1
2,"There was actually great potential for an interesting program which is why I watched it multiple times. I hoped it would get better. Unfortunately, we have a whiny woman and a guy who can't seem to decide much of anything for himself. David seems to be led around by a pretty faces, and flattery, and is blind to what is. While he thinks he's kind, he's basically lying to all the women he's dating, telling them pretty much the same things. The women are extremely catty. I don't know real life women like this, and I've been around for a long time. To have ten women all similar seems against the odds of probability. As for Vanessa, she often seems rather superficial. She wants from the guys what she herself can't or won't give. If some of the kinks could be ironed out, there might be the potential for an interesting show. I can't see this being renewed without changing it.",-1
1,"Two rejects from Married at First Sight are trying to find love in a Bachelor/ette style dating show. The two main contestants, a social reject who has no idea how to act around women and a cute girl who wears way to much makeup, deal with such issues as their dates dating other people or not liking the finer things in life, like escargot. I can feel my IQ slipping away every time I'm forced to watch this tripe. Luckily I'm usually able to make my escape into another room when the family sits down to watch.",-1
7,"David is a whiny baby. I was rooting for him in the beginning, but he seems too immature to select a good wife. He was infatuated with women who didn't care for him--ignoring the obvious warning signs. He told several women he loved them, he ignored the advice of the experts, and he kept giving all the ladies sloppy mini kisses. There just seemed to be no substance to his feelings, since he also told several women things like: no one else makes me feel like you do, I feel like you're the one, etc. It's not cool to lead ladies on by saying things he doesn't mean; that leads to broken hearts. The ending was sooooo pathetic. Please DON'T give David a 3rd chance. He needs to grow up and figure out what he wants in a wife.Finally, David, please stand up straight and stop slumping around. You're much more attractive and masculine when you don't slouch.",1
5,David was a poor choice for the show. He seems to have problems that need some serious attention. The women he hurt didn't deserve his lies and deception. If there is a another season I hope someone more mature is chosen. Vanessa I hope found what she was looking for. She is a little needy but I hope the man she chose is patient enough to help her get over the past and look forward to a viable future.,-1
10,"Mafia dramas are very common things, but Gomorra, inspired by Roberto Saviano's expose of the Neapolitan Camorra, is very good indeed, although beautiful Naples has surely never been filmed so uglily. It resembles 'The Godfather' more than it does 'The Sopranos', with its broad-arc, (soap)-operatic tone, as it tells the tale of the fall of the all-powerful Savastono clan. It's horrific, and one strength is the way its most sympathetic characters are shown to commit acts of utterly unjustifiable evil; and yet one is drawn along in a grand story arc nonetheless. The closest point of comparison is perhaps 'The Wire'; in comparison, 'Gomorra' is more poetic, less didactic, but also less multi-layered, focusing solely on the criminals and only in passing on other elements of civil society. We're two series in now, and one has to wonder if the quality will be maintained; at this point, the story lines that have driven the plot so far appear to have reached their natural ends. But to date, this has been television of the highest order.",1
10,"A Colosseum of crime, that's how I describe Gomorra.Naples crime world is a place for fast living, high stakes and sudden, violent death. Gangs known collectively as Comorra fight incessant, endless wars of attrition, to rise above petty crimes of poverty and desperation. Most die but a few become gang leaders and Godfathers of crime only in turn to be bloodily betrayed and replaced. Its an endless cycle that's reminiscent of the Roman arena.The acting is simply put excellent with plots and sub plots that cleverly and subtly interweave. You get to know characters personally, see their lives intersect, understand how poverty or some other need make them what they are. You see them grow and often die.There are tales of genuine sadness and sacrifice in the personal stories found in Gomorra. People doing the wrong things for the right reasons. To keep family afloat, put food on tables and roofs over heads.I can't say enough about this series and look forward to season five which I believe will be airing in 2020.10/10 from me.",1
10,"Everything about this production is top shelf. It's unpredictable, much like the Sopranos. But it's got more grit and is faster paced than The Sopranos. The dread story weaves and surprises with violent deaths around every corner. There are what seems to be hundreds of locations, Naples revealed. The colour and understanding of colour is brilliant, movie quality. The characters are decidedly unpleasant and truly bad, but one is drawn into their fates as if by magic, testimony to the quality of the actors and their direction. The soundscape is modern and sharp, heightening the tension. If you have a soft spot for Europe and European drama, then you have possibly just found television nirvana.",1
9,"This is a very, very dark series that follows a Mafia clan as they do business in Naples. There are no good characters in this series as like the Biblical city of ""Gomorrah"", the inhabitants and the area of the city portrayed are just full of evil. Father is pitted against son, husband against wife, brother against brother. There is no redemption offered in the series, neither is it sought! People live their lives in evil, and die in gruesome, hideous ways. The series wont do much for tourism like other series e.g Detective Montalbano. The viewer does get very involved with each character, and follows them to their demise. Some of the scenes are beyond belief as it shows that human life has no value in the business at hand. This is not as twisted or cerebral as a Scandinavian Noir might be, it just all about the evil men do! It's worth watching if you have the stomach to do so.",1
8,Another sold season however not as good as its predecessors. With Ciro gone the season focuses more on Patricia than Genny which I thought was a mistake. I don't think Patricia is a strong enough character to carry a season. There was also a pointless episode in which two young thugs rob some of the local gangs. I felt that this added nothing to the story. Apart from that everything about it is great. The acting the script the locations are all 5 star. I hope we don't have to wait for season 5 as much as we did season 4.,1
10,"Make no mistake, Gomorra is no copycat version of some other gangster film or series; it is the evolution of the genre, something we haven't seen perhaps since Un Prophète (2009) by Jacques Audiard.Gomorra makes The Sopranos look as phony as Happy Days. With the feel of a filmed-on-location documentary, in this Italian series everyone looks exactly like who they are supposed to be. The locations in Napoli are grimy and gritty—hardly the Under the Tuscan Sun vision of Italy and definitely not the invented suburban fantasy gangster-land of The Sopranos. The gun battles have an air of realistic mayhem seldom seen in movies and almost never on TV. Gomorra is desperate shootouts, filthy prisons, and a penetrating look at the Southern Italian underworld. What more could you ask for? I didn't mean to disrespect The Sopranos because this series borrows heavily from that American original as well as the works of Tarantino. In the first scene there is a banal conversation between two hoods as one of them complains about his daughter's obsession with Facebook, a matter the middle-aged hit-man and parent knows nothing about. Even in this mundane and seemingly innocuous bit of dialogue we get a glimpse of the vision of Ciro, a mid-level thug. And off we go into the night, both literally and figuratively.Gomorra doesn't fall into the black hole like The Sopranos of going into the lives of the family members, a mistake now made in countless new TV series in what I call the Meadow Soprano Effect. The mafia guys all have families, as we are shown, but they don't bother much with the details and good for that. If I wanted to watch a show about family life I wouldn't be watching a crime series. In addition, there are no half hour blocks of boredom like when Tony talked with his doctor.My big regret is that I don't speak Italian, or whatever version of that language these guys speak in the streets of Napoli. Instead I had to get by on French subtitles. Thankfully, my street French had already got a big shot in the arm with the French series Braquo.The series avoids the gangster movie clichés and instead invents of few new ones which will probably soon be repeated by other filmmakers. Centering on Ciro, the mob boss's top henchman, we get an insider's view of the daily operations of the crime world of this city, sometimes glamorous, other times mundane, but always fascinating.Whoever was responsible for the locations needs a place in film heaven. The portrayal of the family life in the mob is done well without the annoying side-tracks of The Sopranos with episodes dedicated to their tedious children. Just enough for verisimilitude and that's all.Constructive Criticism. I won't back down from my rating of 10 because the series deserves that just on appearance. It looks so real and few movies I have seen come anywhere close to the verisimilitude of Gomorra. With that said there is little or no exposition for most of the violence portrayed. There is simply a paroxysm of gun blasts and someone (or many people) is dead. There is little in the way of ""why"" for a lot of the action sequences. I'd rather have a lot less violence with a better story to explain what is there. In addition, there needs to be someone approaching the part of likable, someone we actually care about. I gave up on Ciro after the murder of the young girl.",1
9,"1 and 2 are lke 9, the 3rd
like 7. also watch Suburra S1 , very good
watch at least season 1 and check out 2nd
took me by surprise how well filmed and soundtracks are,
different arcing of story in each season, even some episodes had some specific characters. chek out Wikipedia for how really screwup Naple and the Gamora is.",1
10,"It is amazing to find an Italian TV show that is on par with heavyweights like Sherlock (2010) or Danish-Swedish co-production The Bridge (2011). What gives Gomorrah the edge in comparison to the other two is its realism. Obviously several stories have been mixed into the plot of this TV show, but the other two shows leave some things open to the viewers opinion.With Gomorrah this is not the case. Today's criminals are in fact enterprises in a very peculiar line of business. They are cooperating, outsourcing with global connections.Season 1 is a rather straightforward story about a crime family fighting for supremacy and, eventually, survival in the underworld of Naples. However, Season 2 made a quantum leap in terms of story lines and plot twists. In fact, towards the end of it there were some moments you've certainly never seen in a crime show, be it about Italian Mob or not. I let you to discover them.Season 2 literally glued me to my seat and made me give Gommorrah ten stars. This was not the case after Season 1 which left me barely interested in what happens next. Violence was ever-present in both seasons, but was never the pivot of the story, more a part of its grim background.",1
9,"Gomorrah is one of the better crime series I've ever seen. It has a 8.7 rating for a reason. I just started watching it because of all the great reviews/ratings I've seen over the years and it has not disappointed! You never know what is going to happen and follows Game of Thrones in the fact that they don't shy away from killing off main characters. It's not for everyone because it's a very gritty, violent, realistic show! Just a warning, once you start watching it it's hard to stop. You'll find yourself binge watching the entire series as fast as possible!",1
10,"Simply put: Gomorra is fantastic.Gomorra is a tale of monsters making money & more monsters. It shows the curse of Naples in as true a light as it has ever been shown. Naples has the best of Italy, but without doubt also possesses the worst of Italy in abundance. Neapolitans are some of the kindest & funniest people on the planet, they remind me a bit of Glaswegians & I know they are embarrassed by the corruption prevalent in Naples. I wouldn't give a Neapolitan official my pish as it would end up in his bank account or some thug's pocket & therein lies the story of this show, as it is about the dark-side of this city.The acting is excellent, there are no hams insight. The storytelling is sublime (although it does have lots of source-material, nevertheless, converting that to the screen is no easy feat). I can't praise this show enough. It holds no punches & doesn't glamourise the life of those it portrays, which in-part, is key to its success. They kill & torture everyone, men, women & children & the series shows this.Well done to everyone involved. There are only a few countries in the world where a show of this uncompromising quality could be made & thank God Italy is one of them. This could not be made in England (nor the US any more) due to the PC-class that tampers away from reality for fear of offence.",1
9,"I love this take of that life. Naples is a gritty city and the family that runs it reflects that. Jenny is super annoying, similar to a joffrey in GOT. The kid is a punk, I hope someone takes him out. Looking forward to the rest of the series.",1
9,"At the end of each episode there is a music track which announces the end of that show and it's a hypnotic piece of music which alerts the viewer, not just to the end of the show, but that this drama goes on; the simple melody and beat makes that clear, and in the phrase that Kurt Vonnegut used in ""Slaughterhouse 5"" , which was 'so it goes', it is a sigh, a refrain for the madness of human action, and for the terrible waste of their lives.This quality is exemplified too in the exteriors of the series: the Giorgio de Chirico exterior spaces, the dogs barking, the ugly 1960s architecture intended to make their lives better, but which is like a brutalist prison for them. No nice tree lined suburban streets for them. For the characters their daily drama is pointless and savage but its their only way to make something of the little they have.To say this series is 'dark' is an understatement; it breathes the worst of human behavior, but the manner is not to exploit, instead it shows the extent of what people endure. In this sense it is akin to 'The Wire' and its journey through Baltimore's underworld.To seek a character to 'root for' is to misjudge the value of drama: it is not a simple parable in which we can attach our aspirations to one character. If it was, Greek drama and Shakespeare, and much more besides, would have no value and most of the dross that mainstream TV and movies serve up would be the paragon of good writing. And it is not.This series may seem to glorify the savagery but it does not: it makes it clear as to the losses suffered, the moral failures, and the social divisions exposed. In this way the writers have done great work as they have with the characters.This series is quite remarkable in all the obvious production areas: it has a distinct look, the actors are all excellent without a miss, the casting choices have a reality too, and the dialect is a real pleasure too, though very hard to follow, it adds texture and depth.",1
10,"Put it up there with The Sopranos and Breaking Bad , the acting is just as good as it gets and the cinematography pulls you right into the storyline.
It's set in Naples, which I visited a couple of years back , and displays the unkempt, neglected side of the city that still sticks in my mind.
Everything is crumbling and weed infested, paint is peeling off most of the buildings and pretty well all of them are cracked and falling apart due to the volcanic activity of nearby Vesuvius.
I visited only the tourist spots and they were bad enough, but this series gets into the seedy public housing projects where more money seems to be spent on graffiti paint cans and drugs than on the upkeep of the city's infrastructure. The sidewalks are full of litter and the slums portrayed would give the Gorbals a run for its money.Having set up the background, it's time to turn to the plot, which is savage and riveting .Centred on a Kingpin's drug dealing family and the problems of keeping everyone involved to heel and of keeping the supply lines open, it is a masterpiece of doublecross and vengeance. It had me asking the question though... are there really that many people taking drugs?
All of these types of productions follow much the same plotlines but this one stands out because of the grittiness of the cast and the superb scripting.
Even with subtitles this is one of those shows that stands out, because every aspect of production is top quality. From suspense to romance it all has you begging for more and you don't see that very often.",1
8,"Overall it's hard to find any issues with this superb crime drama. The character development and intricate backstories only make the violent climaxes that much more powerful. I normally watch foreign content in the original language without dubbing, however, the content is so rich I would never be able to see the amazing shots so I end up using English dubbing... and guess what; it's still amazing. Highly recommend to anyone that wants some as good or better than the sopranos, except in proper Italian.",1
10,"What can I say that the other 9/10 star reviews haven't said? Well for a start ignore anything below 7, even those are unfair. This series is so realistic it's hard to believe these guys are actors and not real gangsters.I've never seen the original film so can't compare this series to it but it if it's even half as good I want to asap! I wish I could speak Italian as I'm sure I'm missing something in the translation but not much.I don't need to give you a plot outline, many others have done so already. If you haven't watched it yet I strongly suggest you do. If you loved the Sopranos then you'll love this even more. If I could give it 15 out of ten I would.",1
9,"..But a certain choice made in season 4. It did change the series significantly.The gritty real nature of Gomorra can not be understated. Napels is a very violent place due to the Camorra in real life. This made me feel like I was getting a front row seat to what it would be like living as a gangster over there.
The relationships all feel very grounded and real. It's basically the non-hollywood version of the sopranos with real Italians (and I love the sopranos just as much, but these are two different beasts)... I put this series off for way too long due to it being subtitled.. I tend to watch foriegn films, not tv series.. But after watching Gomorrah, I've almost only been watching other foreign shows that have been on my 'to watch list' for along time. It opened my eyes to how boring most American shows are compared to many Italian/French/Japanese/Korean and Scandinavian countries series made within the last couple decades.The acting and character development over the seasons is something to be studied. Especially Geno and Ciro. Sheesh, what a interesting relationship the writers developed between those two.And no one is safe in this show.. so don't get attached to anyone haha.
Absolutely brilliant and having only 30k ratings on here is sad for a series that is up there with the greatest tv series out like Breaking bad, Band of brothers, The sopranos etc..If you've been putting this one off, do yourself a favor and watch it now.
If you happen to live in Australia you can stream it for free on SBS on demand.",1
9,"I think this show is uncluttered and beautiful to look at. The dialog is sparse and punctuates the action. I'm not often surprised by any turn of events. Instead I anticipate the inevitable and then revel in its arrival. 
I find this series similar to the Sopranos and at the same time, it's totally different.",1
10,"I saw season 1 and i find it violent, sad, beautiful, entertaining. the story of the two brothers was heartbreaking.
i highly recomand this show.",1
6,"I'm an avid viewer of well crafted series. Crime focused ones are some of my favourites but unfortunately I'm part of an audience niche: most of these series seem targeted for teens and action/comic lovers. Gomorra is surely part of the mostly good ones (The Sopranos, The Wire, The Shield, Breaking Bad some other examples that cross my mind) and I'm happy some foreigners showed their appreciation as well with positive reviews.Despite this, the second series up to the 4th episode disappointed me a lot from a writing perspective. In the second season I hoped to find more depth either from a character, a setting or a plot perspective. I got none of these and we are dragged around with a lot of unbelievable characters (with very few exceptions), no understanding of the background culture where they act and not very well designed story lines (with some plot holes as well).The novel Gomorra focused on how it is possible for criminal activities to flourish in a context like Naples and gave us some portraits of the simpleminded people animating this business with their attempt to become rich and powerful. The series deal instead with a much broader set of characters but stays superficial on most of them: only the Savastano parents and the contexts they are included sound realistic. They do illegal stuff thanks to their connections and their army, recycle the earnings and so on.Criminal activities thrive in an ecosystem due to the multiple and reciprocally advantageous relationships among entrepreneurs, politicians, police forces, bureaucracy employees and of course the violent side of the criminal business. In a developed economy everything is a business opportunity for those able to exert a deep influence through violence and corruption: from small to medium enterprises to public services; even getting a job or medical cures can be targeted I guess. Plus obviously everything illegal. The only questions that would come to your mind if you were a boss are: is that business worthy? what can I do and which are the costs/risks to get it? Instead, as Pietro Savastano gets out of the game in the first series, we are led to believe that Naples is ruled by a bunch of fashionable, violent and ignorant thugs with no apparent charisma, wit or relevant connections which base their power on importing/selling drugs (and I would doubt their ability to import drugs too given their resourcelessness). Being considered bosses means that you decide the rules of the game, keep your critical assets carefully under control and possibly secret: leave no room for rivals. Killing you would mean actually nothing from a business perspective and your family would simply replace you after the expected retaliation.Nonetheless here we are presented with the idea that being a boss means magically being considered one by other lower rank thugs after succeeding in the plot of killing the previous one. And this trend gets heavier in the second season. Camorra doesn't appear deeply rooted in the society: just like in some L.A. gang, these bosses are expected to live less than 40 years, kill at least 100 people in gruesome ways, be able to recruit dozens of ""trusted"" soldiers in a couple of episodes, die and disappear. Hopefully writers will do something more interesting (read realistic and deep) in the next episodes or in the next season, if any. As per now it sounds to me as more of a missed opportunity than as an accomplished drama.",1
10,"Maybe this is one of the best TV shows ever made in the history of television. The characters, the tempo, the music, Napoles and the writing is outstanding. This show is a piece of part that almost everybody just found on internet by mistake looking for other movies or something. This show is based in the book ""Cero,Cero,Cero"" of Roberto Saviano and its represented in the show very well by all the characters. If you're a lover of mob and thriller movies or shows you will not be disappointed with Gomorra. Nothing less, I absolutely recommend this show for all the people that are tired of the empty and unrealistic shows that Hollywood make this days. The beauty of Gomorra is that only few people know about this show and you can recommend the series to a friend and everyone will love the show. Amazing.",1
10,"The best show I have ever seen. Ok, if you dont like violence, subtitles or real life in its harshest form, then look elsewhere. If you want to imagine how brutal the real mafia is, then look no further. Absolutely brilliant, superb, amazing, spectacular, thoughtful, incredible, the best box set ever made bar none. And yes tha includes sopranos and breaking bad. Which i loved too.",1
10,"Perfection personified, every superlative there is!How many box sets do you watch over and over (and over) again?I have watched Sopranos once throughout and breaking bad twice, GOT once, boardwalk empire once, Narcos no more than 3 and many other inferior offerings once or twice, but I have watched gomorrah 10 times and am watching it again now. It is literally off the scale and I want to go to bed but I can't because it keeps on grabbing me.WARNING - Watch other box sets first because nothing else will ever compare to this and like me, you will continually be disappointed by everything else, as you have already seen the best. This quite honestly has ruined me or maybe better, spoiled me. I now compare everything I watch against this, and they just cannot compete. Off the scale in every way.If you like real drama, fantastic acting, script, chatacter building, believability, direction, cinematography, superb theme tune and background music alongside gripping never ending twists and turns, real life, disturbing as it can be with brutal violence as authentic as it comes, then Gomorrah has it all, absolutely off the chart.It is beyond compare to anything I have ever seen and I would be happy if they stop making box sets, knowing experienced the best there is to offer as you cant beat Gomorrah.The drama and language that you are watching are foreign and most probably will be different to your natural language but this is authentic Italian mafia at it's best. (A dream if you are proficient in Italian) but not a necessity as its that good that after a short while. You wont even notice the subtitles, I didn't. That's a promise. My 20 year old son added a perfect positive by saying. ""The fact that there are subtitles means that you have to concentrate and therefore dont miss anything"" And please please dont watch this in the dubbed version as it loses so so much and the voices are terrible and it will ultimately destroy the effect.This is without doubt the best written, directed, produced and casted series I have ever seen. That includes some of the best shows that have been made of a similar genre albeit all different, and that I have had the pleasure of watching. (Sopranos, Breaking Bad, Peaky Blinders, Boardwalk empire etc)I do not have enough superlatives to explain just how good this series is.It has absolutely everything and is the best drama ever made, in my opinion.If you are not intrested in the true origins of the mafia, which involves violence, families, heartache alongside unbelievable cinematography and acting then this maybe this isn't for you, neither is this review.If you want to see the best tv series you will ever see, based on your genre preference which matches the above, then prepare to be utterly and truly gripped and amazed by this 10 out of 10 series.
Miss this at your own expense, you would be mad to do that.I have NO qualms in stating this is the best bar none box set or anything else that you will ever have the pleasure of watching and it will leave you with sense of profound wonder.Ps. I have tried to find something similar that can compare. ""Blood in Rome"" etc and they do not even come close.Absolutely outstanding.I have recently watched the whole thing again and am pining to begin again and again and again.Utterly drawjopping AmazingThe soundtrack and cinematography are the best i have EVER seen.Be warned this is your new no 1 or shall I say numero uno. And now everything you watch will be judged on how good this was.Trivia
Apparently, the writer had to go underground because of just how true the depiction was, similar scenario as the Sopranos.",1
10,"I wanted to write a review for Suburra, so I wanted to see what my review was for Gomorrah: there is none! What?! It was one of the best series have ever seen. I took me a few years to watch, but it was worth the waiting. I am telling everyone to watch this series. Everything I watch after that has big shoes to fill.Why do I like it? It is ruthless,raw, it feels real, it hurts, it will make you think, they go to the next level, the ambiance is breathtaking, you really get involved with the characters and the music... Everything is great. Sometimes a lost a bit of the story, but the thing you see...Go watch this if you like gangsters, criminals, mafia, chess and reality.",1
9,"....They must absolutely respect their word and definitely close with the fifth season. The series is a masterpiece, direction, cinematography, actors, screenplay and above all the characters are something legendary, something that will remain in the hearts and memories of us fans as long as the series ends with the fifth season, I absolutely do not want that the series becomes a kind of sleazy endless soap opera. The best series are always the short ones.",1
5,"The plot is scatter shot, part murder mystery, part romance, and mostly goofy shenanigans. This uneasy mix makes ""Acting on Impulse"" so uneven that if it weren't for some darkly humorous dialog, a great looking black 1954 Corvette, and a few decent cameo appearances, the movie would be totally forgettable. Paul Bartel plays a movie director, which is really typecasting, since he was a director. Isaac Hayes is in and out of the picture from time to time as a detective, and Mary Woronov is a plain jane hotel desk clerk. Linda Fiorentino plays a second tier actress who is wanted for murdering a producer, and she eventually hooks up with C. Thomas Howell, and Nancy Allen at a pharmaceutical convention. The film has a very claustrophobic feel, as most of the story takes place in a hotel. It is definitely watchable, but the mish-mash script is constantly dragging it down, and oh yes there is a surprise ending. - MERK",-1
8,"""Acting on Impulse"" works, as previously mentioned, because nobody is trying to upstage anyone and this film isn't trying to be bigger then the VHS box it was bought in. The situation is simple. Someone has died, horror star Linda Fiorentino takes a vacation, she arrives at a hotel where C. Thomas Howell is having a sales conference, there are shady characters afoot, death knocks at the door with some steamy random scenes, new friends are introduced, old ones are questioned, and finally there is a infamous shootout which brings all our curiosities to rest. In one sentence this film could be summarized, but it isn't the shortness of the plot that makes this film work, it is the surroundings. The jokes are dry, but like an afternoon martini it quenches. As current films force recycled humor, this film takes that sub-par standard and rejuvenates it. There is something fresh about the humor in this film. Isaac Hayes plays the police detective on the hunt for the supposed murderer, and he couldn't act his way out of a paper bag in this film, but for some strange reason it fits with the overall tones and tenacity of the film. Nobody is trying to push the limits here, but it feels fresh and original in the same sense. There are scenes that stand out in my mind, but in your average film would be just boring and cliché. The scene where Howell steals his coworker's briefcase has been used so often, but in this film Howell comes across as the semi anti-hero. We root for the underdog, which is Howell, and yet we have no reason to. He isn't your typical stand-up main lead, he cheats, smokes, drinks, dances, and even gives the report of a lifetime, but that isn't what this film is about. Upon further investigation, ""Acting on Impulse"" is a double-take film. It is a film of trickery and deceit, but in all the ways that make you ask for more. It would compare to going to see ""Hostel"", but discovering it was about romance and not torture. A different take, but perhaps a pleasant surprise.""Acting on Impulse"" sets up as your typical ""who-dun-it"" horror, slasher film where the characters are over-the-top and the situations absolutely are not feasible. We think we know our characters, but then we are uprooted  taken to a new environment, new characters, new situations and the film we once started with has transformed into something completely different. In this case, we went from murder/mystery to those types of films where the main character is on an unknown journey of self-discovery. For about 45-plus minutes we move away from the murder, we are reminded slightly, but for the most part it is all about Howell's life in a dog-eat-dog world. It is about Howell, not Fiorentino, which is tough because the two have this amazing chemistry together. Add in Nancy Allen, the wild card in the group, and we have three people that we think we know, but really (because of our constantly changing focus) they are miles apart. The characters are what make this film work. Our discussion today has been mainly about them because the body that surrounds ""Acting on Impulse"" is used, dated, cliché, and stuffy  but it works. Director Sam Irvin must have seen that he didn't have Oscar caliber work in his desk, but a film that was fun, friendly, devilish, and engrossing all the same. This film is one of those rare examples of films that work with what they have, without seeming cheap or ""independent"".Overall, I have to give credit to the actors again. While many of them have never seen the glory of the big-budget silver screen, they worked well together in this small feature that hasn't seen the DVD light yet. This is a fun movie. It was a random feature that I thoroughly enjoyed and actually craved more. I loved the ending, it was provocative, yet didn't pull that cheesy double-punch that has become the norm for these samplings of films. This film seemed real, and in the same sense it didn't. This is a Hollywood TV movie, actors playing for fun, a plot that may have plenty of holes, but doesn't mind standing up to the rest of the crowd. I would not have any problems showing this film to my friends, or recommending it as a summer watch. It is this random film that caught my attention and hasn't left my mind since the final credits. It feels incredibly like a 80s film, and while I will probably be laughed at in the film community, this little feature is my guilty pleasure. I loved our unknowing trio and the troubles that follow them. Like ""Acting on Impulse"", I have no shame in claiming this film as a great unknown independent feature. It was no crowing achievement in film, but it made do with what it had and gave this film junkie nearly two hours of great cinema.Grade: **** out of *****",1
2,"I'll give credit where credit is due, and say that Linda Fiorentino gives a good performance as a hard-drinking actress who does what she wants.  She's brash, sassy, hard-edged, and very sexy; she is much better than this film deserves.But that is IT.  This dull suspense film is a fragmented mess, attempting at once to be a stalker thriller, a murder thriller, a tale of loyalty and betrayal, and a steamy erotic thriller.  The film, my friends, isn't thrilling in the slightest.For instance, who thought of casting C. Thomas Howell as a desirable leading man?  He is not ugly, but for crying out loud, it looks as though Fiorentino's tough-cookie goddess is getting it on with a kindergarten teacher.  Howell has neither the authority or screen presence to fill the leading man role.The script is by far the worst aspect of the film.  There is no tension as Fiorentino's character gets eerie phone calls, there is no mystery concerning her guilt in the murders that are the focus of the film, there is no sense of liberation as Fiorentino gets wimpy Howell to lose his inhibitions.Look for interesting but poorly-done cameos by Adam Ant and Issac Hayes, and one really, really good sex scene between Howell and Fiorentino.  Besides that, my first impulse would be to put this sorry piece of trash down and go rent something else.",-1
2,Perhaps not my genre but plot was horrible as was acting by Nancy Allen and Linda Farentino. C. Thomas also seemed uncomfortable in role of being seduced here (while on marijuana? why did this need to be included? this weakened plot considerably). Also Farentino's charac. would have been better had she had more respect for a relationship. Would does movie try to say? not much.,-1
9,"I found this film very funny, unpredictable and entertaining.The actors play all very Well and Linda Fiorentino was terribly sexy. It hasn't a very logic plot, but, who cares? It has also some Cameo (Adam Ant and others I don't remember the name) A little pretty film",1
7,"This film from the director who made Animals (2012), replicates the same quietly brooding atmosphere as aforementioned film. A shy introvert teenage boy accidentally crosses paths with his teacher in a cruising area in the local woods, and thereafter attempts to strike up a love affair with him. The romance that ensues is of a tenebrous kind. Moreover, strange secondary characters and bizarre incidents foreshadow something gloomy to occur.There are two scenes in the film, that can be considered Indie music videos. These two featured songs make for nice little sidescapes from the main mood of the film, whilst suiting the narrative perfectly.",1
4,"Two stars for the atmosphere and two stars for some decent acting. Zero stars for everything else.Not much can be said about this film, except that it gets increasingly silly and ridiculous all the way up until the climax, which was quite frankly a joke. We're supposed to believe that a skinny and underdeveloped late teenager can overpower a beefy, fully developed middle-aged man, which is completely absurd - men's muscles aren't even fully developed till 30! Having been a skinny late teen trying to fend off a beefy middle aged man myself, I can tell you the difference in strength is huge. So much so that even though I was giving it my all, I may as well have not been trying. So in reality, the teacher would've dominated any of those teenagers easily.There's also a subtext of ""how dare an older man have sex with a much younger but nevertheless still legal younger man!"".We're supposed to pity or sympathise with the younger guy, but he's quite frankly an idiot with no sense whatsoever. The moral relating to the subtext is quite plainly:""Do that and you deserve to be abused and tortured.""If you believe that's a good moral to go by, then I guess you'll enjoy this film, so long as you have unbreakable suspension of disbelief.",-1
1,"Summary: In a forest on the outskirts of Barcelona, couples (and groups) of various persuasions and inclinations meet for sexual congress. Also in this forest, there exists a group of broken-hearted cannibals who seek either revenge or eternal love (or perhaps both) by eating the lovers who jilted them. It is in this forest where our protagonists Carlos, a university instructor of Chinese, and Toni, one of his students and also a member of the group of jilted cannibals, meet, have a sexual liaison in the back of Carlos' car, and then part company. Carlos intends for this to be a one-time exchange. Toni, on the other hand, hopes for more. Neither Carlos' nor Toni's motivations are explored beyond the backseat of Carlos' car. Carlos somewhat coldly rebuffs Toni's further pursuit. Despite his sexual infatuation, Toni enlists the assistance of his group of heartbroken cannibal friends to do what they do. One night, Toni asks Carlos for a ride home from school. When Carlos' car won't start, three of Toni's cannibal friends happen by and offer to drive Carlos and Toni home. The quartet of horny cannibals taunt Carlos into inviting them in for a drink. Carlos, either not sensing danger, or perhaps drawn by it, agrees to bring the whole party home. After Toni and Carlos engage in one final sexual exchange (Spoiler: Carlos is versatile, in an equal-opportunity kind of way, i.e. he flips with gusto), the other cannibals come into the post-coital bedroom, Toni bonks Carlos on the head with a blunt object, Carlos regains consciousness only to find himself chained down, Toni stabs Carlos in the heart, then engages in an act of eternal love by eating Carlos' heart while the rest of the cannibals consume the rest of Carlos. They then leave Carlos' burned remains hanging in the forest to be found. The End. I experienced this delightfully uplifting film presented as part of the Newfest Queer Horror Night, though Mr.Forés appears to fancy it as more of a love story thana horror film. For me, this film failed on both counts. Forés' work suffers by projecting image and mood over coherent narrative. Where thebest horror films are grounded in some degree of plausible reality,Forés' work suffers by failing to develop a realistic context in whichthe acts of extreme horror occur. The forest seems like an unreal'otherworld' from the beginning. The film also fails to develop anyempathy for, or identification with, or understanding of the protagonists. They are little more than sex-driven zombies. Thus the viewer is left with unsympathetic characters in an implausible context, to be bombarded by the director's visual and aural whimsy. The sex is not sexy, the graphic is not particularly extreme, and the horror is mostly banal. In the after-film Q&A, Mr.Forés attempted to invoke Dalí's supposed quote that ""Cannibalism is one of the surest signs of affection."" as inspiration for this mercifully brief (69-minute...69 HA! I get it!) snuff film. Forés seems however to have divorced Dalí's metaphor for the Spanish Civil War from its context, and in Amor Eterno serves the notion raw and literal. Unfortunately, appropriating an outrageous verbal confection by Dalí is not nearly enough to elevate this failed video project into art.",-1
7,"Elvis Presley was a hugely influential performer with one of the most distinctive singing voices of anybody. He embarked on a film career consisting of 33 films from 1956 to 1969, films that did well at the box-office but mostly panned critically (especially his later films) and while he was a highly charismatic performer he was never considered a great actor.For a mid-60s onwards Elvis film, 'Girl Happy' is pretty good and while not one of his best films, like 'King Creole', 'Flaming Star', 'Jailhouse Rock', 'Viva Las Vegas' and 'Loving You', it is a long way from one of his worst (much worse followed).The story is thin and formulaic, with parts not always making sense, and the dialogue is corn and silliness-heavy and enough to make one cringe. The extras' acting is indeed awfully wooden and just looks amateurish.However, the settings are suitably exotic and the film is beautifully photographed. On the most part, the songs are good. Could have done without ""Wolf Call"" and ""Do the Clam"", the latter of which also being pretty embarrassingly choreographed, but the title song, ""Puppet on a String"", ""Do Not Disturb"" and ""The Meanest Girl in Town"".'Girl Happy' is fun and good-natured, knowing exactly what it wanted to be, who to aim it at and never tries to do anything more. It's all competently directed and breezily paced, while Elvis is clearly enjoying himself and is well supported by charming and fiery Shelley Fabarres, menacing Harold J. Stone and perky Mary Ann Morbley. The chemistry between Elvis and Fabarres is great.All in all, good bouncy fun. 7/10 Bethany Cox",1
6,"Girl Happy finds the King as lead singer of a group that consists also of Gary Crosby, Joby Baker, and Jimmy Hawkins. They're appearing at a club in Chicago run by mobster Harold J. Stone. They'd like to go to Fort Lauderdale to pick up both loose chicks and loose change as it is the spring season. Stone won't let them go. But an opportunity comes when Stone's daughter Shelley Fabares also wants to go to Fort Lauderdale for spring break. Stone sends Elvis and the rest to go to Fort Lauderdale as unofficial chaperons.No need to go any father because as always happens the King finds it nice work and he's got it. But he also has former Miss America Mary Ann Mobley chasing him. We should all have such troubles.In the tradition of Presley pictures, Colonel Tom assembled a fine group of people before and behind the camera like veteran director Norman Taurog who has an Oscar to his credit. Besides those mentioned Nita Talbot plays a worldly stripper with good advice and a good routine with a newspaper outfit for her act. There's also John Fiedler as the motel manager and unofficial keeper of the morals of the youth of America and Jackie Coogan as a police sergeant.No great songs come from Girl Happy, but they're all in the Elvis Presley style and suit the film for him. Fans of Elvis will like the film as will others.",1
6,"Ft. Lauderdale frolic has Elvis Presley cast as a Chicago rock 'n roller who, along with his outfit-matching band members, takes an assignment to secretly chaperone the boss's daughter as she vacations with her girlfriends down in Florida. Plush MGM musical with a dandy production design, lots of fun slapstick and girl-watching. The plot, such as it is, doesn't make a whole lot of sense (especially with Elvis having his cover blown by Shelley Fabares' tyrannical father, who then gets mad at Presley when his daughter decides to go wild). The songs range from very good (""Puppet on a String"", ""The Meanest Girl In Town"") to awful (""I've Got to Find My Baby"", ""Wolf Call""), but there's a groovin' beach bash with excitable dancing and a funny prison breakout sequence in which E.P. gets stuck in a cell with 20 females (and escapes in drag!). Mary Ann Mobley has an insulting role (and her make-up is too dark, causing her to look overcooked by the sun), but Fabares is breezy and there's a nice supporting turn by Nita Talbot as a streetwise stripper. Not bad Presley-fest, though the screenplay could've used some sharpening, and the extras are often hilariously wooden. **1/2 from ****",1
6,"Elvis Presley and his band are ""Girl Happy"" in this 1965 film starring Shelley Fabares and featuring Gary Crosby, Mary Ann Mobley, Harold Stone, Nita Talbot, Joby Baker and Fabrizio Mioni. Presley and his band are hired by the club owner (Harold Stone) they work for to go to Fort Lauderdale and make sure that his daughter (Fabares) doesn't get into trouble. This often means cutting the romantic evenings of the band short, but Rusty (Elvis ends up combining business with pleasure.This is pleasant enough Elvis fare. It's not the kind of movie he wanted to make, but thanks to Colonel Parker, we have a slew of them, part travelogue, part music video. Elvis looks great; the film has a lot of youthful energy and catches the spring break atmosphere. After the success of Ricky Nelson on television, TV stars had to sing, and Fabares is no exception, and she makes a darling costar for Elvis. (Her description during an interview of being told she had to sing by the producer of ""The Donna Reed Show"" is quite funny. She refused and was asked, ""Do you want to do the show next year?"") Former Miss America Mary Ann Mobley is the knockout Rusty tries to romance while on guard duty. Rusty's band, consisting of Crosby, Baker and Hawkins, do well in their roles as lascivious lads.I wasn't as taken with the music as some on the board. It was nice, but I missed a big hit like ""Return to Sender."" Elvis wanted to leave a more important film legacy. I for one am grateful for any chance to see him perform.",1
6,"Nightclub singer Elvis Presley (as Rusty Wells) is hired to chaperone sexy Shelley Fabares (as Valerie Frank), with predictable results... While it was not strong enough to have be trumpeted as a significant improvement at the time, ""Girl Happy"" is a cut above the (then) average Presley movie. Most importantly, director Boris Sagal, along with the writing team of Harvey Bullock and R.S. Allen, effectively make more of a situation comedy with Elvis music, than the more often used, and vacuously plotted, ""Elvis travelogue"" with tunes. The comedy is well-paced, nicely played, and includes some genuinely funny moments.Ms. Fabares' innocent sexuality compliments Presley, and they play very well on screen together. Fabares was understandably invited to co-star in additional Presley movies (with mixed results, due to weakening material). Also very good are Elvis frantic band-mates Jimmy Hawkins (as Doc), Gary Crosby (Andy), and Joby Baker (Wilbur). Fabares and Mr. Hawkins had been a cute teenage couple on ""The Donna Reed Show"". Mr. Crosby was one of Bing's sons (which turned out to be less fortunate than you'd think). And, Mr. Baker was in a regrettably short-lived Dick Van Dyke-type comedy called ""Good Morning World"".MGM wisely used RCA's soundtrack studio record takes for ""Girl Happy"" (for the most part). In the past, there were sometimes completely separate versions for film and record, with the lamer versions making the film. Presley recorded the ""Girl Happy"" songs in June 1964; in hindsight, these and the just completed ""Roustabout"" were the last gasp of Presley as a dependable pop soundtrack singer. Critics weren't enthusiastic about his 1960s film songs, but there were scattered gems throughout. Nothing herein approaches ""Return to Sender"", but there are no real dogs, either.The speeded-up vocals evident on ""Girl Happy"" were not uncommon; recording stars and record companies routinely speeded-up recordings. In the 1960s, many radio stations speeded up every record they played; this way, they could play more records, and get in more commercials. Many old TV shows are speeded-up, also but, back to Presley: His next film, ""Tickle Me"", featured no newly recorded soundtrack songs. After a long period of inactivity, he recorded ""Harum Sacrum"", the first wholly substandard soundtrack of his career. That was followed by ""Frankie and Johnny"". So, dig right in and ""Do the Clam"".****** Girl Happy (3/27/65) Boris Sagal ~ Elvis Presley, Shelley Fabares, Jimmy Hawkins, Gary Crosby",1
8,"Elvis Presley formula movie at its best. Some catchy music, nice scenery and girls galore. Rusty Wells (Elvis) leaves the blowing snow of Chicago for the beaches at Fort Lauderdale during spring break. Rusty and his band are to guard a mobster's(Harold J. Stone) daughter(Shelley Fabares) without her knowledge. Boy sings; girls swoon. Best songs are ""Cross My Heart And Hope To Die"", ""Puppet On A String"" and ""Got To Find My Baby"". Cast seems like a party list featuring Mary Ann Mobley, Gary Crosby, Joby Baker, Jimmy Hawkins, Chris Noel and Nita Talbot. One of the most liked Elvis flicks. Soundtrack sold tons.",1
6,"Another Elvis Presley movie, another cringe-inducing title: predictably, as trivial as can be but, surprisingly enough, quite a fun, comedic vehicle with Elvis and his band assigned to chaperone a gangster's teenage daughter at a holiday camp. Shelley Fabares is among Presley's cutest female leads (she would co-star with him twice more in just as many years) and at times reminded me of Martha Vickers's thumbsucking Carmen Sternwood in Howard Hawks' THE BIG SLEEP (1946)! Of course, the couple's eventual romance is complicated as much by the easily misunderstood situation as by their being needlessly involved with other partners.Familiar character actor Harold J. Stone, usually noted for drama, is the gangster but, while he plays it mostly straight, isn't exactly menacing either; the songs are a cut above-average, though ""Do The Clam""  a would-be instant 'beach blanket' hit  is a definite low point! Former child star Jackie Coogan  of Charles Chaplin's THE KID (1921) fame and who was then undergoing a brief career renaissance as the lunatic Uncle Fester in the cult TV series, THE ADDAMS FAMILY  appears here as a flustered cop but his participation is, alas, an undistinguished one.Amazingly, I recently learned  through a newspaper article written by a friend of my father's who happens to be the No. 1 Elvis fan I know and who was also the one to introduce me to home video technology back in 1985!  that GIRL HAPPY was banned in Malta on original release (most probably due to a 'hot' striptease act the boys witness more than once during their runarounds after a tipsy Fabares)!!",1
6,"With the metaphorical anvil of university exams dangling precariously overhead, I decided I needed something to lighten the mood. So I turned to the King, Elvis Presley – a man whose legendary talent, charm, and good looks were sure to brighten my wearied spirits. In this frothy 1960s teen comedy with a stupid title, Rusty (Presley) and his band of sex-starved musicians (including Gary Crosby, son of Bing) are sent down to sunny Fort Lauderdale to chaperone, from a distance, the daughter of their employer. Though initially unenthusiastic about watching the plain-looking, academic Valerie (Shelley Fabares), the boys quickly change their tune when she lets her hair down and slips into something, let's say, more appropriate to the Florida climate. Many romantic hijinks consequently ensue, including a high-speed boat ride, an impromptu beach party (involving a completely hideous ""dance"" called The Clam), a drunken strip-club brawl, and a prisonbreak going the wrong way. Most films that try to make a beautiful actress appear plain or bookish (usually before a surprising transformation) do an absolutely terrible job of it. Here, conversely, a very pretty Shelley Fabares is made to seem convincingly unappealing in her first few appearances. This illusion is, of course, quickly abolished, as Rusty comes to fall for her intelligent charms, even while straying occasionally towards a more conventional pin-up girl called Deena (Mary Ann Mobley). Though the boys' spring-break romances never get beyond wholesome necking, the social attitudes are nevertheless rather liberal, with frequent overt references towards sex. (Even the nerdy bloke, played by Peter Brooks, ultimately decides that casual sex is better than finding ""a girl with a mind""). Elvis' performance is laidback and entertaining, and Fabares has a fun chemistry with him; she would appear in two more movies opposite The King.",1
6,"Thinly ""plotted"" Elvis Presley comedy with Shelley Fabares, who reportedly was Elvis' favorite of all his leading gals. Elvis is the front man in a vintage '60s pop group who leaves the snowy city of Chicago along with his band mates for a spring break down in the warm and bikini-busy Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. He manages to secure the trip by telling his mobster employer that he'll be sure to keep an eye on his boss' college-aged daughter (Fabares, who's cuter in SPINOUT) while she's also vacationing down there with her girlfriends. Typically zany mishaps ensue, but along the way there are some enjoyable songs... ""Girl Happy,"" which is the best of the bunch, ""Do Not Disturb,"" ""Puppet on a String"", ""Ft. Lauderdale Chamber of Commerce"", and the latest beach blanket rage, ""Do the Clam""! Presley still seems to be pretty game. **1/2 out of ****",1
7,"Arguably one of Elvis Presley's best musical films, this one features plenty of witty writing and romance, with Shelly Fabares supplying the loveliness. ""Do the Clam"" and ""Fort Lauderdale Chamber of Commerce"" are a hoot, and even the worst Elvis haters will have to admit that ""Do Not Disturb"" is one sexy seduction number.",1
7,"Perhaps it's the beach pleasant atmosphere, perhaps it's lovely leading lady Shelley Fabares, perhaps it's an overall decent story and competent supporting actors but Elvis seems to be enjoying himself in ""Girl Happy"" and chances are you will too.Elvis plays a lead singer of a hot rockn' roll band who manipulates himself and his band into chaperoning a gangster's daughter while she's partying in Fort Lauderdale - so they can escape the freezing cold in Chicago. And soon he falls for her and she for him.It's a simple, lightweight story as usual with Presley's later films but the songs are good (""Puppet on a String"" especially beautiful), it's got lovely scenery (although heavily set in studio, as most Presley films) and competent performances from all involved. Shelley Fabares is a knockout beauty but she's also a good performer and looks quite dashing on stage with the King performing ""Meanest Girl in Town"".",1
6,"Elvis Presley goes to the beach in this musical comedy romp about college coeds on spring break. Elvis gets tasked by a Chicago Mobster to keep tabs on his daughter while she is on spring break in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The only qualm I found was that in a movie set at and about the beach and spring break Elvis was always clad in long sleeved, long necked clothing. It was noticeably weird.",1
8,"Another pretty enjoyable Elvis movie. Good music, good looking girls/women, decent humor, and of course the bad fight scenes. Elvis and his band are tasked by Big Frank to watch over his daughter, played by the very cute Shelley Fabares. Mary Ann Mobley starts out as Elvis's love interest but fades out as he stars to fall for the daughter. There is a scene where Mary Ann and Shelley are both in Elvis's room, one on the patio and the other in the room. It is funny to watch him trying to keep one from seeing the other. There is the Italian gigolo who sets is sights for Shelley and it takes all four of the band members to keep him away and out of the picture. After a riot at a club a whole bunch of kids are arrested and ailed. One turns out to be Shelley. When Elvis finds out he gets a group of guys to tunnel into the jail so he can reach her. He gets in to the women's jail cell only to find that Big Frank has shown up and freed her. The girls are released but before they leave the cell they huddle around Elvis and dress him as a woman so he can leave with them. After talking to her dad Shelley finds out that while Elvis was paid to watch her he was not paid to take her out, kiss her or otherwise get involved with her. So she realizes she loves Elvis as he does her and they apparently will live happily ever after.",1
5,"At first sight, it's carefree fun, Elvis here is still his good-looking, lean and smooth self, the music is surprisingly fresh and compelling, and the oversaturated colors of the movie add to the sunny feeling. On the other hand, by nowaday standards it's all too obvious how fake and cheap the settings are, all studio-done in stead of on location; how the really funny moments are scarce; and how between his songs Elvis only goes through the required motions with uninterested and slightly bored magnanimity. Even his supposed love for sweet and attractive Shelley Fabares impresses as lacklustre and hardly passionate.What surprised me the most, was the slighting way in which girls are treated and talked about. Especially by the three Jordanairs, they almost drool at the first sight of girls in bikini, they besiege and jump on every girl that comes along, they elaborately praise curves and contents of bathing-suits, and all the time pop-up from behind bushes with yet another girl. But also Elvis himself is part of it, we see him literally throwing a girl around to make out with her, and forcing himself on her when she tries to hold him back (of course the script doesn't let her really mean that, but still!).The ultimate illustration of this was the spectacled nerd who at the start of the movie is ridiculed when he argues that he only should like a girl for her brain and not her body, and at the very end of the movie is seen with his arms around a full-breasted bimbo, stating about this girl: ""I know that there is nothing in the attic, but boy, what a staircase!"" And is complimented by Elvis for at last coming to his senses!I know, it's meant as harmless fun, and it's of course a sign of those times, I shouldn't look at it with the eyes of 2020's #me-too convictions. But still it made me feel a bit uncomfortable.",-1
8,"Everything was going great and then one of Elvis' bandmates actually uttered the line, ""The King is dead!"" and that kinda put a creepy damper on things.",1
10,"If you want a great, happy, entertaining, sexy, fun movie this is the one to watch. Elvis and Shelley Fabares are in peak form for this film. The plot is straight forward. Elvis and his band(Gary Crosby, Jimmy Hawkins & Joby Baker) are sent by Mr. Frank(Harold J. Stone) to Fort Lauderdale to keep an eye on Valerie Frank(Shelley Fabares), his daughter. The movie starts with Elivs and his group on stage singing Girl Happy(great song). Then they head off to Fort Lauderdale to keep an eye on Shelley. They sing Spring Fever(great song)together with the girls in their cars. There are some great close-ups of Shelley's beautiful face in the car. They arrive at the Seadrift Motel. They find out Shelley is a hottie when she goes for a swim. Elvis goes out to sing Fort Lauderdale Chamber of Commerce(great song). Shellley in coming out of the pool at the time. We get see her in a two piece swimsuit. Nice Body! Anyway, she goes to the club with a nerd that night and leaves with Roman(a Latin wanting to get romantic). Elvis and his clan find them on his boat and drive it back to their hotel before anything happens. Next day we get a scene with Shelley in a nice looking two piece yellow swimsuit. Ramano takes her back to the hotel for something. The guys get Elvis to intervene. He calls the manager in and he breaks up a card game they are playing. Elvis decides to add her to the act to keep an eye on her. Next scene is Elvis and group singing Meanest Girl in Town(great song). Shelley comes out in a gold top tied at the bust and black hot pants and high heels(she has never looked hotter than in this scene). She dances around with a sign reading I'm Evil. With her belly button exposed she does a few more sexy spins and the song ends. She goes in to change(too bad). That scene is worth a rewind or two. Next Elvis sings Do the Clam(great song) to get her to come to him. He takes her home singing Puppet on a String(great song). About this time his other girl Dina thinks he misses her. Elvis has Shelley to dinner and Dina also shows up. Elvis is very funny here as he tries to keep both women from seeing one another. Elvis and Shelley then have a good time riding, dancing and sailing. Finally Shelley gets a phone call from dad and he tells her about sending Elvis to watch her. She goes wild with Romano at a dance club and gets arrested. Elvis tries to break in, but is too late. He goes back to the club to sing on the last night. He goes out to pick a girl to take on stage for the last song Girl Happy. Shelley is there and all is forgiven after the Mr. Frank has told Shelley that he really has feelings for her. They go up on stage and dance and kiss. The movie ends happily the way I like. All the songs are top notch and every actor in the film is great. So if you want a happy, upbeat movie try Girl Happy, Elvis' best movie.",1
3,"How I loved this when I was 14.
Watched it about 10 years later ....elvis at 29 making this kind of fluff ? AND with mostly poor songs, poorly produced . (Soundtrack is horribly mixed ).
The man who conquered Hollywood by age 23 , succeeding as a dramatic star in several pictures , one intended for Marlon Brando , was now grinding out silly formula flicks , with songs written by teams of writers forces with composing to fit the scenes !
Elvis and his co star, Shelley fabares , both were about 7 years too old to be doing this , though they look great together - and Shelley is a wonder - though her best acting came later in the sitcom Coach .
The songs are , admittedly kinda catchy , but there's really say, 3 worth hearing more than once . There's a real rocker here , ""the meanest girl in town "", also known as ""she's evil "" by Bill Haley and His Comets , it's pretty great .
If you are a very casual elvis fan , not judging his Hollywood output against King Creole or flaming star or Follow that dream or Viva Las Vegas, you just might enjoy , on some Friday night , this comedy . The story is groovy , the premise funny .
Dark Chicago to sunny Florida . Elvis is a struggling band leader told to look out for a mob guys daughter during spring break .
Well......maybe it will make you ""happy ""er ! First buy a Six pack and six kfc wings .",-1
5,"This fun 1965 movie starring Elvis Presley and Shelley Fabares should be put in a time capsule for a movie representing the carefree mid-1960's in America. Kids were still fairly innocent, the Vietnam War hadn't jaded the country and the drugs that pervaded the late 1960's weren't as prevalent the time this movie was made.Elvis plays Rusty Wells, a musician hired by a mobster Big Frank (Harold Stone) to guard his daughter Valerie (the lovely Miss Fabares) who has gone with some girlfriends to Ft. Lauderdale on Spring break. Valerie doesn't know her overprotective father has hired Rusty and his group of rag tag musicians to watch her, and of course, she and Elvis fall in love.The movie is similar in some ways to ""Where the Boys Are"", but is not as serious. Of course, with it being an Elvis picture, we have to have the Pelvis sing in several cheesy but fun song and dance numbers. The songs ""Girl Happy"" and ""Do the Clam"" are classic cornball songs, but fun to watch. This movie was one of my favorites from my childhood and it is amazing to me how I can still remember the lyrics to these songs after all these years! Elvis never was a great actor, and over the years his movie roles kept getting sillier and sillier, but this movie, silly as parts of it are, is still a lot of fun to watch. And boy was Elvis hot when he was young!",-1
10,"This was the third movie I saw with Elvis as an actor. It was very nice! The plot moves on forwards nicely, and there are funny moments. One always enjoys the music and his singing, when it's around. The song, ""puppet on a string"" really stayed in my mind ever since I watched the movie. The dress the main actress star of the movie wears is so cute. I think it's a typical style of movie from the 1960s but I liked it very much. Very easy to watch. It's a nice Elvis movie, in my opinion.",1
8,"I recently obtained the newly-remastered DVD of ""Girl Happy"" and I must admit that I was surprisingly taken aback at how much I enjoyed this rather entertaining 'beach' movie.I first viewed ""GH"" on TV back in 1986 and suffice to say that it didn't really make a great impression on me due to the somewhat lacklustre material of songs that Elvis performed in it. However, even a few of these managed to charm my tastebuds this second time around.Obviously, it's not one of Elvis' best overall movies but is certainly in the category of one of his best (and much-loved) 60's musicals - it is really entertaining. Elvis is in fine form along with a good supporting cast that includes leading lady, Shelley Fabares along with Bing Crosby's son, Gary plus the sultry Mary Ann Mobley and Harold J. Stone.A particular scene that I found fascinating was the action-packed fight in the club, Elvis appears to be doing so well fending them off with some karate moves and all when suddenly he takes a bottle over the back of the head! An unusual and unpredictable happening in one of his movies at this point.""Girl Happy"" is not one of my favourite Elvis movie soundtracks but the title track is OK, albeit somewhat faster in speed. There's also the catchy ""Cross My Heart, Hope To Die"", a duet of ""Spring Fever"" which wasn't featured on the original album, and the sweet ballad ""Puppet On A String"".It's worth checking out, and if it doesn't grab you the first time then maybe it will on a second viewing.",1
7,"A fun, mildy amusing Elvis Presley movie with some not so bad songs ""Puppet on a String"" ""Girl Happy"" and ""Do Not Disturb"" being the best. Elvis plays nightclub singer (again!) Rusty Wells in Chicago. The Nightclub owner, a short tempered, loud, tough guy known affectionately as ""Big Frank"" sends Rusty and his two bandmates to Fort Lauderdale, Florida to watch over his gorgeous 21 year old daughter Valerie - played by Elvis' favourite co-star Shelley Fabaras in her first of three appearances as an ""Elvis Girl"". The boys follow Val and her two friends to the popular holiday resort in Fort Lauderdale in time for ""Spring Fever"" where hundreds of lusty university students flock to in search of fun and romance, under strict orders to keep the wolves at bay for Big Frank...or else! The film also stars another beautiful lady as an Elvis love interest, former ""Miss America"" Mary Ann Mobley who would also appear in The King's next film ""Harum Scarum"". In the midst of trying to enjoy some romance of his own with Ms. Mobley, and keep those wolves away from Val, Rusty finds himself falling for Val. After spending a fabulous day with Rusty, Val speaks to her father on the phone and tells her all about him...only for Frank to spill the beans on the real reason Rusty is there for - to mind her for him. This sends Val over the edge, and after a drunken night out ends in a bar brawl and a spell in the local police cell, an amusing attempt to get himself arrested to get her out due to a soft natured policeman, Rusty finally breaks in to the cell by digging a tunnel in in true prison spoof style! When Big Frank gets wind of his daughter's arrest he arrives in town raging, but after a heart to heart with him Val tells her of her feelings for Rusty, and after a dazzling performance in the local Club the two are finally United with Big Frank's blessing. Girl Happy is silly, sixties fun. It has some funny moments - such as one of the band mates disgust at his girl ditching him for another bloke ""Where is he!? If I find him I'll break him in half!"" he brags...as the new body building boyfriend appears and whisks her away. An enjoyable, fun film. The girls get Elvis, the guys get Shelley Fabaras and Mary Ann Mobley - everyone's a winner!",1
2,"The fledgling series takes an ugly turn with this ill-conceived episode that attempts to glamorize the dubious undertaking of Nazi hunting.The cast is acquitted of all blame for the episode's failings. And this cast had a lot to offer fans of THE TWILIGHT ZONE and STAR TREK: Frank Overton, Michael Conrad, Alfred Ryder and Roger C. Carmel. Wasted in cameos were Ed Asner and fearless Zanti-Misfit fighter Bruce Dern. But the spotlight is on Lew Ayres, playing against type and pulling it off admirably--he's a talented actor. There's nary a hint of kindly Dr. Kildare in his Frank Bartlett aka Daniel Torvald, icy and unsmiling, zealously reading his Old Testament at every opportunity to fuel his eye-for-an-eye ideology. Torvald ignores the commandment not to bear false witness, however, as his entire life as Frank Bartlett is a lie. He goes on to lie about planting the photograph and about his fall from sabotaged planking. Men who strive for virtue but deceive themselves into believing they can cherry pick which virtues or which commandments to live and obey are at best hollow and worst dead men walking.And in that is the episode's irony: the ""villain""--easily discerned by the episode's title--has left behind the ugliness of war, embraced American values, and is living an honest, productive life. Conversely, the ""hero"" has been wallowing in hate for fifteen years, suffered arrested development as a human being in 1945 and is effectively as dead as the victims he seeks to avenge. Torvald is a victim of the Nazis who didn't stop being a victim when the war ended. He's been drinking poison ever since and hoping the other person will die.Torvald gets his wish in a silly and unsatisfying ending. Nazi-hunters wanted to relish their captives being tried, vilified, and executed on the world's stage as would happen to Adolf Eichmann in 1961-62. As another reviewer noted, the May 1960 capture of Eichmann surely served as Stirling Silliphant's inspiration for this ""torn from today's headlines"" episode. But I wonder if Silliphant penned the ending we got with Otto's crazed and ill-fated leap for and inevitable fall from the departing helicopter. I could see network executives insisting on such a pat ending that gave the audience immediate closure. Torvald departing with his captive implying Otto will be tried and executed in Israel may have been deemed too murky.I wished Tod had stuck to his initial instinct to oppose Torvald after calling him out over the parlor trick with the photograph that subjected a locker room full of innocent men to an awkward and unjust accusation. In their defense, Tod and Buz weren't privy to the later psychological stunts pulled by Torvald--the Hitler speech record that unnerved the innocent cook, or the voodoo doll planted on the pillow of the guilty party. Torvald's reckless stabs in the dark hoping to hit the guilty hit many innocents, but in Torvald's skewed morality ends justify means.This episode was a misstep in many ways, a whodunit lacking suspense and satisfaction, morality as seen in a funhouse mirror, and a promising cast that was squandered. This was a story celebrating those who look back instead of looking forward. I'm glad Tod and Buz have their eyes set on the road ahead, and I'm eager to join them wherever that road takes them next.",-1
9,Tense and exciting episode featuring Ayres as a undercover Nazi hunter getting a job on a offshore oil rig in order to try and weed out a fugitive member of the German Nzi party who is hiding out as one of the rig's crew members.What makes this episode so intriguing is the fact that neither Ayres nor the viewer has any idea which one of the crew members it is until the very end. This creates some great tension and mystery as Ayres orchestrates a lot of elaborate tactics to get the culprit to expose himself.This episode is also good as it gives a very rare and vivid glimpse of just what it is like to work on an oil rig. The excellent camera work and direction make you feel like you are right there. There is also some really good (and dangerous) stunt work and as usual episode writer Silliphant comes up with some very profound and memorable lines of dialogue.Grade: A,1
6,"That dance teacher was ridiculous, it gave me vibes of Andy Dick's character in Old School, except this one actually had some funny moments. The show isn't sure whether or not to take the comedy further and I think that is its biggest flaw. The Jimmy Smits entrance was great, but they didn't go far enough with him actually carrying through on his threats.",1
5,"Lucy Hill (Renée Zellweger) is an aggressive executive from Miami who's new in a freezing tiny little Minnesota town. She's a fish out of water in town to downsize half the plant. Only the workers aren't cooperating. Plant manager Stu (J.K. Simmons) takes advantage of her. The union rep Ted Mitchell (Harry Connick Jr.) clashes with her right from the start.This is an attempt at rom-com without any likability or chemistry. The jokes of Zellweger and the cold are more misses than hits. Nobody really shines in this one. They're mostly just competent. Like the weather, it takes awhile for anything to warm up here. It's a fairly flat effort, a flat 5/10 effort.",-1
4,"New in Town is a bland inoffensive rom-com that wants to channel the off beat spirit of Fargo without a murder mystery.Rene Zellweger is Lucy Hill, a troubleshooter sent by headquarters from her base in tropical Miami to turn round an under performing food processing factory in Minnesota. Hill soon finds that the weather is far from warm as Miami (she arrives in heels and any lack of warm clothing) and the locals are hicks used to small town ways and so there is immediately a culture clash.Hill also falls foul of the kind hearted local union representative (Harry Connick) who also conveniently happens to be a widowed single parent.As time goes by Hill who in effect needs to fire people realises that she can turn the company around by taking a high risk approach but needs to rally the town together and proves to the company that she works for that she is prepared to scrap with them to save the factory.This is really a fish out of water comedy of a woman who realises that the town has depth and comforts missing in her life. The hunky widowed union rep helps.This is watchable but it would never amount to above average. The accents were laid on thick, sounded Canadian to me but it there is never anything original in the pudding baked in this movie.",-1
2,"At the time of its release, I had heard about and possibly seen a trailer for this film, so when I got the opportunity to see it I wanted to see whether or not I would agree with the low opinion rating given by the critics. Basically Lucy Hill (Renée Zellweger) is the high achieving high-powered company consultant who enjoys an upscale lifestyle in Miami, and she is sent to the almost middle of nowhere town of New Ulm, Minnesota. There it is her job to oversee the restructuring of a blue collar manufacturing plant, and one of her responsibilities is to lay off a few of the workers. Lucy takes an immediate irritation toward the woman she is staying with and who is the office secretary type, Blanche Gunderson (Men in Black's Siobhan Fallon Hogan), and slowly she works through the other changes that will be made in the plant. Being new in town and after all her slightly cold-hearted actions she is given a very icy reception by the locals, and she also has to put up with the freezing cod weather and icy roads that don't help her get places. Slowly though Lucy starts warming to the people of the town and their lifestyles, so much so that she is regretting more and more the actions she is taking for her work, especially as she is being accepted more and more. The big kick in the nuts is when she is told that the plant is going to be closed down, and she seems not to have the power to do anything about it, she is worried that the entire community will be out of work. In the end though, Lucy tastes Blanche's secret recipe for tapioca pudding, and she reignites a former yogurt production line which creates a lot of interest amongst buyers, the plant is saved, and Lucy gets a happy ending with her love interest Ted Mitchell (The Iron Giant's Harry Connick Jr.). Also starring Spider-Man's J.K. Simmons as Stu Kopenhafer, Mike O'Brien as Lars Ulstead, Frances Conroy as Trudy Van Uuden, Ferron Guerreiro as Bobbie Mitchell and Barbara James Smith as Joan. Even a sweet perky faced and lovable actress like Zellweger can't save this rather ridiculous story, she is in a pointless performance, well, the whole film is pointless, it did not make me laugh, it did not make me happy or sad with the love story, and almost none of engaged me, it is just a stupid and not worthwhile romantic comedy. Pretty poor!",-1
6,"This romantic comedy is predictable and the two stars are better than the movie itself. Lucy Hill(Renee Zellweger)is an attractive Miami businesswoman, who is on the move. She is determined to work her way to a CEO position. She is assigned to travel to Minnesota and restructure a yogurt factory. Lucy must learn to cope with all the trappings of being the outsider in town. She butts heads with the union rep Ted Mitchell(Harry Connick Jr.)as she tries to educate the factory workers about efficiency; they already personally know about downsizing. Being accepted takes time. Zellweger, in a non-sexual way, shows her assets as her character endures the typical fish-out-of-water circumstances. Her co-star is charming and it is obvious the two work well together.NEW IN TOWN is directed by Jones Elmer and the cast includes: J.K. Simmons, Siobhan Fallon, Mike O'Brien and Wayne Nicklas.",1
5,"Too cute for words and vapid as the day is long romantic comedy about an executive (Renee Zellweger) sent to Minnesota to restructure and downsize a local manufacturing plant. She of course changes her ways and finds love with Harry Connick. The level of the humor is to have Rene go from Miami to Minnesota and not bring a parka or to have people talk Minnesotean (A close dialect similar to Canadian ""Oh don't you know""). Its not bad its just so by the book and by the numbers that you really have to wonder how this ended up with this cast on the big screen instead of on Lifetime as a feel good movie of the week. I didn't mind it but its so unremarkable that I kept wondering why I wasn't doing something more important, like the dishes. If you're into mindless romance go for it.",-1
5,"""Lucy Hill"" (Renée Zellweger) is a corporate executive living in Miami who reluctantly volunteers to fly to Minnesota to restructure a factory in the small town of New Ulm. Naturally, being from a big city she realizes that things will be a little different but she is totally unprepared for the culture shock she receives-and the tremendous change in weather to boot. Be that as it may, she is determined to accomplish the task at hand and puts aside the feelings of the local employees in the process. But it isn't until she fires the shop foreman ""Stu Kopenhafer"" (J.K. Simmons) that things begin to go downhill for her-and this causes her to realize just how badly her corporate mentality adversely impacts all of them. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that-for a romantic-comedy-there just wasn't enough chemistry or humor to differentiate this film from so many others of its type. Fortunately, unlike the cold weather found in Minnesota, there was at least a small amount of warmth to be found every now and then which certainly helped to some degree. That being said, while this wasn't an great film by any means, it wasn't that bad and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Average.",-1
7,"In this economic climate of corporate downsizing, one wonders how the corporate boys in monkey suits on the board run their business with the help of a spreadsheet. It's always easy to see which areas of the business bleed red, and decide then on to send hatchet-men to the ground to execute (pardon the pun) and prune various portions of that wound to try and stop the hemorrhage, failing which a complete amputation would be required. It's easy making such decisions from the ivory tower devoid of decent human interaction, but never easy from the folks on the ground to do it, because it leaves just a bad aftertaste, especially when the folks are friends, and people you know.For Lucy Hill (a visibly aged Renee Zellweger), she's a high flying executive of a corporation headquartered in sunny Miami, but what I think was because of a sexist board, she gets sent off to the wintry conditions of a small Minnesota town to effect their wishes, and that is to remove 50% of the employee population there to keep an unprofitable factory there under some cost control. Being an alpha-female type who never say no to challenges and her career, she makes that journey and has this high-and-mighty air about her, which through the course of her stay in town, their warm hospitality, sense of humour and all round, small town camaraderie, will slowly thaw that cold heart of hers.There were plenty of charming moments in the film, courtesy of a whole host of ensemble characters built for the plot, such as Siobhan Fallon's Blanche Gunderson, who becomes Lucy's personal assistant aka secretary, and in all earnestness, tries to establish a friendship with her would-be boss, as well as trying to hook Lucy up with the town hunk Ted Mitchell (Harry Connick Jr) who so happens to also be heading the workers' union. Complications naturally arise from this conflict of interest, which puts Lucy in two minds as she has her orders to follow, yet find herself inevitably drawn to follow her heart as well. And yes, this is also truly a romantic movie, which I thought had effectively balanced affairs of the heart as well as how modern day corporations run the shop, with pink slips being very easy to dish out.Some portions remind me of a Hong Kong movie about a noodle factory (whose title eludes me at this moment, but starring Sam Hui and Tsui Hark, yes you read me right), where a band of merry men have to put aside their differences from their immediate manager and amongst themselves, to try and salvage their jobs and their livelihood. It's a pretty standard affair that you see both the problems and the solutions coming from a mile away when they're mentioned, and the plot is extremely straightforward as well, with no meandering twists and turns. But hey, it's supposed to be a romantic story, and both Zellweger and Connick Jr did well given their limited screen time together to make it all believable.But the scene stealer here has got to be J.K. Simmons, who disappears effectively behind a fat suit and is quite unrecognizable. He represents the kind of supervisors that managers love to hate and have no qualms giving the marching orders to, but also serves as a reminder that such on-the-ground folks who garner the respect of the troops, are always worth their weight in gold, because once they're on your side, they have motivational techniques par none to get things done.I was OK with the romantic plot here, but the Management 101 issues presented, was way more entertaining and valuable.",1
5,"If you want to see a romantic comedy, then chances are you've probably seen others. And if you have, then you have probably seen this one in a previous life as well. There is absolutely nothing original in the script, acting or even soundtrack. This is a factory movie and should be treated as such: trash it.If you are still wondering what it is about: big town corporate bossy lady comes from Miami to Minnesotta to ""restructure"" a plant. People there are all small town folk and, besides from their reluctance to restructure their jobs, they also have a completely different local culture. Long story short, they find common ground in a final scene of romantic kiss and long group applause.Bottom line: when they learn to do the 3D CGI actors look and feel like normal actors, they will be able to generate a movie like this with a piece of software. Not sure they haven't done it already.",-1
2,"Almost from the very first moment (in fact, before, because you must know a bit about the story when you decide to watch it) you know where this is going in every way. You know where it's going in terms of character development, in terms of the requisite romance, in terms of the plant's fate. Sure, there are a few specifics that need to be filled in, but there are no real surprises. Now, even with a complete lack of originality, a movie can succeed if it gets the intangibles (for lack of a better word) right - casting, the heartwarming cuteness that you expect from such a story, believable characters. If those things work, the movie can work, as predictable as it may be. Unfortunately ...On the upside, there were a handful of those heartwarmingly cute moments, as Lucy (Renee Zellweger) comes to terms with her new life in the town of New Ulm, Minnesota. Lucy's a high-powered corporate executive based in Miami, looking to make it to the top, when she gets sent to New Ulm in the middle of winter on a corporate hatchet assignment - to get rid of the local plant (what they made was never really clear to me.) She's a fish out of water character: the city girl who knows nothing about small town life; the Florida girl who knows nothing about winter; the rich girl who knows nothing about working stiffs. So, obviously, the movie is about her adjusting to this life. In that adjustment, we find a handful of heartwarming moments - particularly the scene where she joins the townsfolk around the Christmas tree to sing ""O Come, All Ye Faithful,"" and the scene in which she helps Ted's daughter get ready for the Valentine's Day dance.On the downside, there weren't enough of those heartwarming moments. Zellweger (who I usually enjoy) also disappointed. Usually, even if the movie is less than stellar, her performances impress me. Here, I felt that she was miscast; never coming across as believable as Lucy. Mind you, that was a larger problem than just Lucy. There was a sense of unbelievability to the characters in general. I admit that I have little experience of small-town Minnesota. When I was about 8, I think I spent a night with my family in a motel in Duluth. That's my Minnesota experience, which doesn't really qualify as small-town, rural Minnesota. Still, the stereotypes in this movie seemed overdone. Extreme stereotypes can work - the same sort of thing was done with small-town Minnesota, for example, in ""Grumpy Old Men"" (but that movie was at least humorous.) In this, to me, the stereotypes came across as less than flattering and less than fun. There really wasn't much in this that would lead me to recommend it - not even the presence of Renee Zellweger, who's made a few weak movies watchable for me in the past.",-1
8,"Lucy (Renee Zellweger) is a Miami executive for a huge conglomerate. The powers that be decide that rising star Luce should be sent to New Ulm, Minnesota, in the dead of winter, to ""downsize"" a yogurt-making plant. As she gets off the plane, a cold wind sends the young exec into a cursing frenzy of chills. Things get worse. The town folk feed her dishes like meatloaf and tapioca and workers at the plant resent her ""I'm in complete charge"" attitude. Not only that, but our dear girl manages to insult the town's catchiest bachelor, who doubles as the plant's union rep, Ted (Harry Connick, Jr.), even as the local matchmakers hatch a plan to throw the two of them together. But, Lucy's ice-cold feelings for her new situation may be in for a thaw. For one thing, Ted comes to her rescue when her car gets stuck in the snow and she begins to see him in a different light. Then, too, New Ulm's townies may be provincial but they have very big hearts and Lucy starts to warm up to their gestures of goodwill. But, then, word comes from the higher-ups that they are going to shut down the plant entirely, under Lucy's direction. With so many folks about to lose their jobs, can one Miami-loving gal help make a difference in their future lives? This is a lovely gift from the romcom fairies to earthlings, like me, who adore those funny tales of amour. The main stars are wonderful, with Zellweger giving a nifty turn as the ""fish out of water"" businesswoman and Connick, Jr. wooing everyone with his homespun charm and looks. The rest of the cast, including Siobhan Fallon and Frances Conroy, is very nice, too. As for the setting in Minnesota (actually, the film was shot in Winnipeg), it is harshly beautiful while the costumes are a mixed bag, with Zellweger looking great but with Connick stuck in flannelshirt purgatory. But, that means little, as the production, script and direction are polished, funny and full of life. Have you been waiting for the next ""really good"" romcom? Don't waste a second, fans, but see this one ASAP.",1
3,"New In Town was a movie I avoided for a long time, due to the horrible reviews from everyone i knew, so I decided to finally bite the bullet, and check it out. Unfourtantley this is one of the rare times, where I have agreed with the critics. New In Town is often sloppily executed, with unfunny jokes about Minnesota's culture, etc. Renee Zellweger's character is very hard to like as well. She's snotty ,she's full of herself, and most importantly didn't care about anyone but herself, and when the time predictably came for her character to change, it was too late for me to care. Harry Connick Jr. is really the movie's only saving grace. His gruff, charismatic performance made me get through this film. I also didn't buy how Renee and Harry, developed so quickly. New In Town didn't give them near enough time to develop. New Town is a misfire in all attempts, there's too many lack of laughs, unsympathetic characters, and most of the humor comes from secondary characters, like J.K Simmons, etc.Performances. Renee Zellweger plays a bit of a Brown Noser here, and as a result her character is heavily unlikable for a lot of the film. She does what she can with the material, but she doesn't quite have the charisma to pull it off, unlike the time she did in Jerry Maguire. Harry Connick Jr. Is much better. His charisma, and sly show managed to make some scenes bearable for me. Siobhan Fallon provides some amusement with her whiny persona, and her constant making of Tapioca pudding. J.K. Simmons has a few funny lines, and I enjoyed his presence.Bottom line. New In Town is certainly nothing new. In fact it's a boring, redundant, and unfunny romantic comedy, that you needn't waste your time or your hard earned money on.3/10",-1
5,"""New in Town"" is a Comedy - Romance movie in which we watch a young woman traveling from Miami, Florida to a small Minnesota town for her work. There she meets a new and very different world from her own where she needs to adapt quickly.I found this movie very funny and good since it combined very well comedy with romance in a very clever way. It was not the classic comedy - romance movie that everyone expected and that was something that made the difference. Despite its simple plot there were many interesting moments and it was not boring at all. The very good interpretations of both Renée Zellweger who played as Lucy Hill and Harry Connick Jr. Who played as Ted Mitchell helped the movie very much. Finally, I have to say that ""New in Town"" is a nice, funny movie to spend your time with and I recommend you to watch it because I am sure that you will laugh a lot.",-1
5,"There are better romcoms out there. This one never really gets funny or romantic. It's a formula movie (so what), but it's never really hitting the mark.Any good? Well, for Renee Zellweger diehard fans this movie will do fine, (I guess). It's not irritating to the point that I cant stand it. That's a good thing (I guess)The bad: seen it all before, (done a LOT better elsewhere...)The story: Renee Zellweger plays a b*tch from a big company who is going to fire lots of hard working people in a small town, of which one is Harry Koninck Jr. Will romance blossom? Pfff...(simulating a deep sigh...)",-1
3,"I tried to watch this run of the mill film but had to give up. It is one of those 'city slicker meets hick'-themed movies, this time with the city slicker being career gal Renee Zellweger in her high heeled shoes (on which the director tends to dwell too obsessively, perhaps being a fetishist?). It is always comic to some degree when the city slicker meets the hicks and gets taken down a peg by Real Life. In this case, the hicks are not Southerners for a change but are austere, only partially comprehensible locals presumably of Scandinavian extraction in the frozen wastes of (shudder shudder) Minnesota (Quick! bring the blankets!) There is plenty of cold and snow to make poor Renee shiver. And we get rather obvious jokes like when she is asked if she knows how to use the fireplace and naively asks where is the switch. But the humour is tepid, the direction is uninspired, and the film limps along until you turn it off. Worst of all is what Renee Zellweger has done to herself, and I say that as someone who has always enjoyed watching her until now. The whole of her amusing and charming character seems to have removed by some surgeon's knife, and I barely recognised her. Where are those delightful crinkly eyes? Gone! And are those really her breasts? Really, by succumbing to peer pressure in Hollywood to try to make herself look beautiful (which she never was), she has written herself out of the script as far as I am concerned, as I don't like what I see. This is a sad, sad day for individuality in actresses, when one of the genuine originals has reduced herself to the status of a very faded carbon copy which no one can any longer read. Why didn't she leave herself alone? She could have gone on being interesting for decades if she had not tried to gild what was never really a lily anyway. I say this in sorrow, and I will miss her.",-1
6,"Guess what is not new in town at your local movie theatre? Another formulaic romantic comedy. This one is called ""New in Town"" but old in design. Not new= a female protagonist trying to prove that she can tackle any challenge. In this case, a once again mediocre Renee Zellweger plays Lucy Hill; an executive living in sunny Miami who is ordered to reside in cold Minnesota for a few months to play efficiency expert at a company plant. Not new= independent girl bickers with hometown boy and eventually fall in love. In this case, a once again mediocre Harry Connick Jr. plays Ted Mitchell; a Minnesota labor union rep who fights with Lucy and then  well, do I have to repeat myself? Not new= Female protagonist is seen by small town residents as an unruly big city tyrant and then eventually changes her ways because of unforeseen circumstances. In this case, Lucy is seen as the ""mad slicer of jobs"" by the plant workers until .. well, do I have to repeat myself again? To say the least, Director Jonas Elmer fuddles and struggles to provide creativity in ""New in Town"" and does not give Minnesotans justice by copycatting the ""Fargo"" character playbook. Jonas my brother, sorry to share! Screenwriters Ken Rance and C. Jay Cox did not interject any verbose ingenuity in ""New in Town""; in fact, everything sounded kind of old. Now there is something that kind of salvaged the film from the boring cold! That came in the form of another spectacular (also not new, but we like this one) acting performance by the underrated J.K. Simmons as a Plant Foreman. ""New in Town"" should not be deported from your movie wish list, thanks to Simmons, but then again it is far from being the best new movie in town. *** Average",1
5,"Just as a Random Number Generator is put to use in statistics and cryptography, Hollywood seems to employ a Random Romantic-Comedy Generator to churn out fluff like New In Town. For this one, they set the generator to bland and pushed the ""Minnesota people are funny"" button to produce a shallow and erratic but marginally amusing film that is entirely supporting by the subjective charms of Renee Zelwegger. If you like her, you won't mind this. If Zelwegger grates on you, watching this movie will feel like being dragged at high speed over a gravel road.Lucy Hill is a corporate executive from Miami dispatched during winter to a plant in New Ulm, Minnesota to handle its retooling for a new product line and the elimination of half the workforce. She arrives to meet a colorful cast of small town characters, including a handsome and abrasive union leader (Harry Connick Jr.). In a development that won't surprise any living thing on Earth, including the bacteria living in my commode, Lucy falls in love with both the townspeople and the union rep and when her bosses announce they're shutting down the plant entirely, she has to find a way to salvage both the livelihood of the community and her budding relationship.Now, I like Zelwegger so I found New In Town to be Perfectly Acceptable Entertainment. Yes, it's predictable and obvious and unoriginal and stumbles from one rom-com cliché to another without any structure or direction. Lucy Hill is a cipher, her love interest is practically an absentee character and the only reason the two of them wind up together is because there's literally no one else in the story they could be with. But there's nothing jaw-droppingly stupid about any of the plot, none of the characters have to act like compete and total morons to keep the story going and there are persistent attempts at humor through the whole thing. As chick flicks go, this is not a pain to sit through.The Random Romantic-Comedy Generator did manage to spit out a couple of interesting concepts, but they go criminally underutilized. Early on it's established that the workforce at the plant has made a habit of running mangers out of town and there are moments when New In Town almost wanders into a more lively and unexpected story about the conflict between an ambitious executive who cares only about her career and the subversively devious employees who don't take kindly to outsiders telling them how to run ""their"" plant. There's also a second where it seems like the movie might use scrapbooking as a metaphor of the difference between small town permanence and the disposable world of on-the-go corporate existence. Neither of those opportunities are recognized or taken advantage of.If you hate rom-coms and/or Zelwegger with a passion, this motion picture is not for you. If you like either or both, New In Town will be an okay way to kill 97 minutes. You know which group you belong to.",-1
5,"And I overpaid for it. It's not that bad but I wanted to make that joke.This movie is trashy, predictable and very smug in the way it treats small town rural people. The only thing that was interesting in this film is how the urban ostensibly liberal character wasn't economically populist. And the rural conservative character, being a union agent, was populist. It was a nice bit of irony and contradiction that made the character feel slightly more human. You arrive at the resolution of the plot at least 30 minutes before the film does and there's really no romantic comedy trope left undone. But some of it is a little clever. A lot of it is very entertaining in a train wreck sort of way and the really bad bits are quick and well saccharine. I feel like this is a film to throw one in background during the holidays",-1
8,"Charming, cute, feel good, predictable, funny, (sometimes LOL funny) did I mention predictable? Okay how about cliché? This was a nothing sort of movie that had its moments especially if you've ever had to deal with severe cold or the idiosyncrasies of small town living and it's locals. (I could relate to both). There's a decent back-up cast here playing the townsfolk and I enjoyed Renée Zellweger in her role as a transplanted Miami businesswoman. She's transferred to a tiny Minnesota town to restructure a manufacturing plant and must adjust her lifestyle accordingly, not quite how she pictured climbing the corporate ladder.There were moments in this movie that really made me laugh, (the nipple scene killed me) but all in this is just another forgettable romantic comedy. Sometimes though that's exactly what you're looking for, plus there's something yummy about Harry Connick Jr. even if he is looking a little rough here. 05.13",1
8,"New in town is so cute and refreshing to watch and enjoy. This romantic comedy might not be the most original one in the whole world, but boy it sure is entertaining. Renee Zellweger is so great in this starring role, she really fit the character well. And Harry Connick Jr. Was really well suited for the main love interest, he physically looked the part and acted well too. And oh my god Blanche Gunderson was perfect in this movie!! I loved her character, very funny, she was by far the funniest the funniest part of the whole film. And the other actors did well too with their respective roles. The script wasn't very original, but it didn't really have to be, because it was entertaining and cute and funny too, and that's what people were expecting and wanting from this film, so in my mind, it delivered on that part. The love story and the intimate scenes between the two leads were both very well done. Getting to hear their backstories in the intimate love scene was very cool and it made me invest even more in their characters. I give it an 8/10",1
3,"There is a quiet fireside scene between stars Renée Zellweger and Harry Connick Jr. on a couch about midway through this 2009 rom-com. It lasts a couple of minutes, and that is one of the very few redeemable qualities that this otherwise flat and predictable film has to offer. It's no wonder that this movie came and went very quickly in theaters because I'm really amazed at how poorly constructed it is by Danish director Jonas Elmer and how overly reliant it is on cutesy humor and dated stereotypes. I thought Zellweger already went down the path of the smug career woman with her unctuous turn as a Doris Day wannabe in Peyton Reed's retro-kitschy ""Down with Love"", but it looks like she is going down the well once again with even less fortuitous results this time. She plays Lucy Hill, a cutthroat middle management executive on the fast track in a Miami-based food processing conglomerate. Sent to the arctic-level cold of New Ulm, Minnesota, Lucy has been assigned to dismantle and downsize operations in order to produce a new snack bar line.Tough as nails with the high heels to match, Lucy is unsurprisingly hated by most of the townsfolk with two exceptions. One is her devoted secretary, Blanche Gunderson, who has a secret tapioca recipe that figures into the by-the-numbers plot, and the other is Ted Mitchell, the local union representative who pushes Lucy off her self-anointed pedestal only to find himself falling in love with her. The film's first half is marked by all the typical fish-out-of-water clichés that co-screenwriters Kenneth Rance and C. Jay Cox could resuscitate, or at least copy from Charles Shyer's ""Baby Boom"" (1987), while the second half is even worse with Lucy inevitably winning the trust of the townsfolk with her fierce determination redirected in saving the plant. The means by which she finds success for the factory is almost as predictable as the makeover montage showing how she transforms Ted's adolescent daughter into a prom princess. Attempts at Capra-level corn seem not only uninspired but completely unoriginal, and the aw-shucks stereotypes of rural Minnesotans lifted from the Coen Brothers' ""Fargo"" only add to the contrivances pervasive throughout the plot.Photographed in a most unflattering manner, Zellweger has rarely been this unappealing on screen, and it's a wonder why she would have accepted a role as soul-curdling as Lucy. Connick comes across as either belligerent or listless as Ted, and the chemistry between the actors suffers for the dichotomy. As kind-hearted Blanche, Siobhan Fallon Hogan (the birthing coach in ""Baby Mama"") is never given a chance to elevate the character above a regional stereotype, while J.K. Simmons (the wiseacre father in ""Juno"") manages to score a few points as the plant's curmudgeonly foreman. Interestingly, Winnipeg, Manitoba substitutes for rural Minnesota, and credit cinematographer Chris Seager for fully capturing the rigorous winter conditions. Given how dismal the movie's box office returns were, the 2009 DVD provides a surprisingly robust set of extras with a making-of featurette as well as a couple of other shorts spotlighting some of the plot devices like scrapbooking and tapioca pudding. There are some deleted scenes and an optional commentary track with the cast and crew.",-1
7,"The Mishaps of Musty Suffer were a series of three seasons of short subjects starring Harry Watson Jr., star of circus and Ziegfeld's Follies. He played the filthiest, most unlikely of tramps who underwent all sorts of extreme punishment, mild echoes of which can be seen in the wackiest of Tex Avery's work and Crockett Johnson's BARNABY strip. Musty was first offered to the films in a never-released feature, KEEP MOVING, which was chopped up into a series of short subjects.In this one, Musty climbs into an unoccupied mansion, where he dreams of bathing in beer. Meanwhile, beneath his window, his stage partner, George Bickel, performs part of their band act while Musty dumps used bath water on the musicians.It's thoroughly disgusting and utterly hilarious. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll undergo decades of therapy, but once seen, you will never forget Musty.",1
4,"It's easy to criticize as a casual viewer a project which to the participants was very important. There were flaws too numerous to mention, acting as wooden as an oak dinette set and effects worse than those found in the Turkish version of Star Wars.That being said, it isn't as horrible as some movies I've seen when taken into perspective, nor was it 'above the fray' either. Ironically some given a huge budget and A-list stars spew out puerile, lackluster donkey droppings and try to coat it with a golden sheen (or Charlie Sheen, which is worse) for mass consumption.I was vastly disappointed after watching it, but who knows what I was expecting. It seems every movie I watch that you can tell was shot on video has sucked worse than a Hoover with a V-8.What pushed it up (1) star was the bloopers. Why? I could tell they had fun doing it and that's what matters most to me anyway. I don't think they were out to make a billion dollar epic. I've always had a dream to make a low budget horror film and like it or not, The Stitcher is probably better than anything I could do.I would like to point out that most of the acting was sub par, the lead male did pretty well all things considered. There were even moments when I was startled, but then realized I'd fallen asleep but woke up and 'The Stitcher' was still on.I won't waste time on the sordid details, lets just leave that to the DVD box art.",-1
3,"I am a great supporter of independent films in general, and horror films in particular, so it pains me to have to say some of the things I am about to say. While this movie as a whole has a pretty amateurish quality about it, no story or plot to speak of, and is basically a bunch of people you have no sympathy for moving through a series of set pieces with ""creepy"" local characters, there are a few noteworthy performances from a cast of unknown but plucky actors. Obviously working with limited resources, stilted dialogue, no budget, and no direction, these performers still manage to breathe enough life into this otherwise comatose film to at least keep serious fans of the genre from popping it out of the DVD player and moving on to something with a plot, engaging characters, or good special effects. (Or at least just some skin....) What kind of slasher flick has no sex or even make-out scenes whatsoever??? Why are these people being stalked and killed if they haven't violated the ""Rules of Slasher Movies"", as set down in ""Scream"" and ""Scary Movie""? It seems a bit insulting to the horror fan that the director seems to think that the movie needs to ""dumb down"" in order for the audience to ""get it"". Boob shots and annoying, drawn-out drug jokes seem to be the order of the day, and the director let the stoner guy (who was obviously NOT stoned on weed throughout the movie, but was on something else entirely) chew the scenery until there was nothing left that had anything to do with this movie. Judging by the DVD cover, and pretty much the movie itself, the director/producer/distributor seemed to wish they could ignore the leads in the movie in favor of anyone who farted, had a bad accent, or boobs - or, god forbid, all three. I thought the woman who played the female lead, Brittany, was far and away the most natural and likable of any of the characters, despite her lack of decent dialogue, character development, and being forced to have almost all of her scenes with the incredibly wooden male lead, Nick, and managed to make you root for her and find her sexy despite being directed to scream and whine throughout the movie. And after seeing her in the red bikini, I really hoped to get to see more of her. Also notable was the actress who played Michelle, who managed to have a real character and made you feel something about her, even though she is not in most of the movie. And Homeless Loretta was mildly amusing, although in no way threatening or scary. Who says you have to be a blond with big boobs to get the guys' attention??? As for the guys in the movie, the only one I found even half-way engaging was Kurt, who, again, isn't in very much of the movie. But at least his scenes were with Michelle, which no doubt helped him out. And the gardener, Leroy, who did a good job but wasn't used effectively. Honorable mentions go to Deputy Cedar and the cute blond who played Tamara, both of whom had some nice moments. To sum up: totally non-scary, not sexy (the hot tub scene even ends up with the ""hot chick"" throwing up!!!), a killer who looks like he just came from the elementary school Halloween Carnival, and a stilted, not scary, and not nearly as funny as it thinks it is script written by the director.",-1
9,"THE STITCHER! Bringing a ""NEW"" twist to classic slasher films.....You would have to be a complete idiot. To not see the potential in this horror films character the Stitcher. Although, amongst horror movie fans it is hard to compare him to greats such as Micheal Myers, Jason, Freddie, or GhostFace. Yet, this character has the same right to co-exist within the same realms of fear.I have been a religious fan of horror films my entire life from watching my first, The Demon, in classic black and white, to the most recent shockers completed by Rob Zombie. Although, the Stitcher is an independent film. Darla Enlow armed with her production company NeXt Monkey Films, VCI Entertainment, the Well Selected Actors, and the amazing Musicians on the films soundtrack. Has compiled and resurrected the definition of a potential classic character and slasher film. Bringing elements of fear and real life to this film. While casting actors, that truly brought to the stage a keen sense of getting its viewers drawn to the story.The true design or foundation of any horror film requires the careful balancing of fear. Which Darla, has successfully done. Bringing to life films. Which are seen by the mainstream world as untraditional, yet truly admired from the independent realm for the priceless accumulation of blood and gore. She is a true scientist of horror, who truly paints outside the lines of Terror. Of what Hollywood would consider too terrible for the public to view. Yet, brings true fear and leaves you wondering, if there is any truth to this story. Did you just witness a victims first hand account.I had the pleasure of viewing the film. Before, the conventions and seeing firsthand the true blood sweat and tears Darla & Dana put into this film. Most current critics would base this film off of what they think they know in horror films. Most regular mainstream viewers would shrug their shoulders. Yet, as I sat on the steps within the theater room watching this film. I also took the time to see a packed theater room for a pre-screening. Full of all walks of life. Dazed and wondering. How in the world did two women from Oklahoma. Commit to a goal and bring to life a monster that could very well live next door. That could also exhibit the corruption in most small towns. Then successfully wrap it all up with a twist. That left hundreds talking that night about the fear and looking over their shoulders as they walked to their cars. In my opinion which only matters to me in the end. That was an amazing night of true horror! I give this film a 9 for the effort and classic rendition of a slasher. Most would say, ""That is OverKill!"". I give this film, that rating, because until we can literally jump into hell's dimension and film that! No one deserves a 10. But, I know these two women gave their all. They also helped me complete a goal by hosting my single, ""Nokturnal"" and giving my record label a firm foundation to walk on. I also saw first hand how the NeXt Monkey Films Cast and Crew sacrificed time, effort, and money into a dream. They are all a family who fight like all families to leave this world with a story and legend. I honestly feel they have done so, and done so with true Love. Passion within the realms of creation. That no one could truly understand without struggle and desiring to bring entertainment.So watch this film and bear witness to a film full of deadication and true horror......until the sequel. Goodnight! Be sure to lock your doors! Never wear buttons, because, the Stitcher just may be lurking in the shadows of your neighborhood.HF of Murder Morgue Records llc. www.MurderMorgue.com",1
8,"I watched the DVD of the Stitcher recently. The main reason being I live in Tulsa and the movie was made in Tulsa. Darla Enlow writes, directs acts, etc. and involved in every aspect of the film. As an independent horror film I enjoyed it very much! I don't want to give any spoilers. But the film has horror, comedy, partying and a some eye candy. What else can you ask for? Just kidding! From watching the bloopers, the cast had lots of fun making the movie as well! I recommend this film to anyone who loves horror movies and Loves having fun and doesn't take movies as seriously as Siskel and Ebert! Oh, I forgot to mention this movie also has GREAT MUSIC!",1
7,"This is another under the radar gem, this show is also another childhood gem as I saw this when I was about eight and at that time, I was a ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" fan, when this show caught my eye it really took me by surprise as it was an animated show slightly similar to that property but a lot stranger and just as cool. I honestly never even knew that this show was a licensed animated adaptation of ""The Toxic Avenger"" let alone the movie company ""Troma"", this show led me to both as the film is one of my favorites of all time as well as a fan of ""Troma"".But beside that this was a fun animated show even though in my book it's not quite a classic licensed cartoon on the level with ""The Real Ghostbusters"", ""Men in Black."", etc. But came pretty close. Yeah, I know making a licensed animated adaptation for kids based on an extremely R rated film is kind of of strange but back then there were really no rules on what kinds of film adaptations you can do for a certain audience.Personally, I'm glad because it shows how people back then were willing to take chances and we're worried about Politically Correctness or Cancel Culture two big barrels of toxic waste that truly are polluting our entertainment environment. Seeing this show at times makes me wonder about what other R rated movies could have been made into licensed animated shows.The animation is solid it's about the same kind that you would see from ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" (80's show) and certain other shows in the 80's. I really like the character model roster who are animated well; from Toxie whom still looks like his live action counterpart but a lot of the other characters from the Crusaders to the Bad Guys, whom are all ugly yet uniquely cool looking at the same time much like some of the ""Turtles"" character roster. The theme song is an honorable mention in personal favorite theme songs as well as another under the radar theme song, the song just has this rocking tune that is catchy.The action is solid really like seeing Toxic and the crusaders kick ass, but one other thing about them is each of them much like the ""X-Men"" have superpowers, which are each unique and have different functions. Toxic doesn't really have superpowers except for his superstrength and having a mop being alive as a useful pet. Nose Zone who has the power of wind though sneezing. Major Disaster superpower is the strongest and best in my book, like ""Swamp Thing"" he has elemental powers where he's able to command the elements of nature.Story and characters are solid, from Toxie whom is the usual straight man. Really like how he reacts to certain things going on around him which feel a little how any of us would, in a way he's really the only sane person in town.But I also really like the bad guy Doctor Killamoff whom is another underrated villain, this guy is pretty much a corporate jerk. Really like the voice where he is menacing but due to his over the topness he's also kind of funny. But one thing that's interesting about him is his motive where he's polluting the environment to create a livable one for him and his people from the other dimension. And I like that because here they did something different with the whole environment pollution premise which at times is always simply about greed which is still here, but they also put in alien invasion, so I thought that was creative showing how you can do more with an old premise.Show could be a little dark as it's hinted that Killamoff may have already succeeded in his scheme of polluting most of the Earth and that Tromaville is the last or one of the last non polluted areas. This just adds to Killamoffs menace and makes the stakes all the higher for the Crusaders because if the Crusaders fail to defend Tromaville then it's game over for us permanently.What makes this show truly unique is that is in its tongue and cheek humor as well as some cleverness in it. This show is kind of self-aware of how ridiculous and crazy it really is. It's interesting how it has that two way affect similar to Batman 66 where when you watch this as a kid it seems straight forward, it's funny but some jokes might fly over your head. But when you watch this when you are older, the show I find even funnier as you can see certain jokes you've never picked up on. The show does have a good message on taking care of the environment but it not preache, doesn't shove it down our throat, but is stuttle as it focuses mainly on one thing having fun.It would be cool having an animated revival of ""Toxic Crusaders"" but it could be one for adults so it would be truer to the ""Troma"" fans where we would see the crude humor and over the top graphic violence which would be cool as we'd see the Crusaders kick ass more but turned up to 11. This show could be on a streaming channel or even on the Adult Swim block on Cartoon Network which would be fitting as most of there stuff can be even stranger and messed up than ""Troma""Though if anything it would be cool to have a live action version of this show, there are two ways this can happen either ""Troma"" thinks of making a fifth sequel to ""The Toxic Avenger"" where we would see Nose Zone and Major Disaster come as supporting characters and Dr. Killimoff does become the main villain. Or this can be a sequel to that upcoming revival movie to ""The Toxic Avenger"" that is if it doesn't suck. Well thoughts to consider anyway.""Toxic Crusaders is worth a crusade.Rating: 3 stars.",1
9,"I was a fan of Troma films as a kid, believe it or not. I had The Toxic Avenger, Redneck Zombies, The Children, Nuke Em' High, etc. mostly on VHS tapes and it wasn't until I was a teenager that I found out about Toxic Crusaders.Alright, just saying, I am an eco-sinner (yes it's a term now, so far only defined online on Urban Dictionary). Eco-sinners love polluting the earth on purpose for various reasons, and despite being highly knowledgeable on the topic of pollution they care nothing about the environment. Since I'm a prolific eco-sinner, I usually steer clear of movies and TV programs that show pollution in a bad light (Captain Planet, The Lorax, An Inconvenient Truth, etc.). But hey, I loved this cartoon. If I love it and I'm against the environment, then I'm sure chances are you'll enjoy it even more.Toxic Crusaders lasted thirteen episodes but parents were wary since the show, albeit harmless for kids and sticking to child-friendly language and animation, was based on the Toxic Avenger film series, notorious for the amount of sex and vulgar language. Toxic Crusaders follows the adventures of Toxie, a nerdy but caring superhero mutant, along with his team of Tromaville mutant friends and his girlfriend Yvonne, while they fight a gang of ""mutant pollutants"", roach-like creatures from a planet where pollution is to them what oxygen and water is to humans (I want to live on the pollution planet, I'd love it so much more!). The pollution roaches are ruled by a short leader named Czar, but on Earth most of whom is seen doing the real polluting is Dr. Killemoff, who has to wear a gas mask to survive the air on Earth, has a business suit and the misleading appearance of an industrialist, and smokestacks on his back (never really explained). He has left Tromaville heavily polluted from his many factories and hazardous waste dumping operations.It wasn't so much the stupid enviro-hippie propaganda message within the series that I enjoyed. Had it been some other movie or program I likely would've hated it. However Troma's lovable characters and the cool animation is enough to keep you watching 'till the end. I loved the soundtrack, especially the theme song, which I now have on my MP3 player.Don't pass up this excellent and hilarious cartoon series, it's really worth watching at least once, even if you aren't a fan of Troma movies. While the Toxic Avenger certainly isn't appropriate for kids by any stretch of the imagination (I bought my VHS tapes at a yard sale since my parents would never dream of buying them for me), Toxic Crusaders has no bad language, very little, if any, violence, at last not in a gory blood-shedding way, no pervy sex jokes and is harmless for children. I highly recommend it for people of any age, although my favorite Troma movies will always be The Children and Redneck Zombies (on a side note, it'd be great if Troma did a film on the Tobacco Man from Redneck Zombies, he was a really cool character).",1
9,"This excellent production debunks the myth of the asexuality of the disabled. It shows a young male artist with cerebral palsy sketching and painting women in the nude, then uses his sketches to masturbate. His struggle to perform sexually is honored as his auto-eroticism, including use of a vibrator, is a role model for other disabled individuals. His voice-over provides a humanistic perspective to the production, as he speaks his reluctance to offering this intimate portrayal of his sexuality, but does so in hopes of educating others about the sexuality of those with disabilities. An excellent production for training professionals and for people with disabilities.",1
4,"Though beautifully shot with exotic locales, lavish wardrobe and period sets, this first film is too over-the-top for my tastes. The story is super sweet to the point of childish and though there's a conspiracy afoot, I never really felt the characters were real enough to care much about what happens to them.Acting-wise everyone did an okay job except for the leading lady. Now, she may be a fine actress but the dialogue she had to deliver, in a proper British accent, before the turn of the last century, was way too 'stagey.' I don't know what it is about speaking the King's English of that period, but it's very hard to pull off convincingly. For the most part it sounded like it was being read from a book on a stage to children. The only performance of late that has been noteworthy would be Kiera Knightly in Pride and Prejudice.In any case, sorry to inject a reality check into these back slapping reviews, but reality checks should have been happening all through this production. If it's just a playful fantasy film then make a cartoon, but if you want real recognition, real respect and real success, your film needs to feel real and for me it just didn't. What's funny is that in the 30s and 40s this film might have been a big hit.",-1
8,"very interesting story, would have liked to get to know a bit more about daily life of rich and poor. Where is spirituality/ religion for the protagonists? Architecture clearly plays major role, could it have been more part of the story? It's magic is marvelously set up! Laxmi could have told us more about the meaning of dance(s). The romance had slight touch towards newer Indian productions although not too kitschy(Jayant/Vijay). The dream of romance between east and west seems to blossom only in Greek tragedy. todays multicultural superficial melting is not happier. Why was Asha overly afraid of 'taking role' of Grace, since she was already accustomed to India, is the western culture never really comprehending? I had a great movie night!",1
10,"This movie will jolt your basic premise of love and pose a question in your mind as to how far a woman in love would go to stay connected in body and soul with her beloved. With a colorful backdrop of the British Raj, this well orchestrated love story brings out the colonial interplay between the Indian kings and the British imperialistic intent in a nostalgic and compelling way. One of the best scenes is when the lead character makes some bold choices manifesting her inherent sacrificial nature that transcends her beyond the mortal boundaries. The colorful Indian costumes capture the regal setting of the colonial time period well. The soundtrack is gripping and highlights the emotional theme in a profound manner.",1
8,"""The Memsahib"" was a gorgeous indie treat, apparently the first (and only) film by an Indian American woman who made a story of reincarnation based on the deep inspiration she felt when she did her masters thesis on the Adalaj Stepwell in Gujurat India (you can google for amazing images and information). The 15th century queen of the Raja who designed the well jumped to her death in the water after her husband died, so the movie is a 19th century colonialism era version of the story with a 20th century conclusion of the reincarnated king and queen finding each other again at the well. Very powerful beautiful movie with fabulous settings and costumes, unfairly scorned by critics who saw only slightly sub-par acting and could not believe or perceive the spiritual heart of the deep fable. I only hope the director's life was appropriately enriched by the experience of manifesting her dream project, even to the point of consciously discovering her own karmic relationship to the legend of the well. If she was the Rani or Raja or a friend of theirs, she has surely done her homeland a great proud service that will continue to resonate for lifetimes to come (the obscure film remains reasonably accessible and available). May Ms. Majmudar be always reunited with her own beloveds too.",1
9,"In her very first effort, director Kruti Majmudar has created a beautiful film that spans the centuries and gives viewers a delightful peek into Indian history and culture. This love story, with clever twists, is well-acted and nicely paced. The male and female leads (Emily Hamilton and Parvin Dabas, whom you may remember from Monsoon Wedding) play dual roles. In the first part of the film they are characters in a period piece set in the 1850s. Later on, they play a man and woman in current-day India. Cinematographer Rajen Kothari captures the incredible landscape and gives the film a very polished feel. My favorite scene is one where young Indian women are learning to dance at the site of the well that was the springboard for Majmudar's story and also the subject of her Masters thesis for her architecture degree. (Majmudar answered audience questions following the film's World Premiere at the Stony Brook Film Festival in July). The combination of authentic music and gorgeous costumes, traditional dancing and camera movement made me feel I was in on the action -- if not as a participant, at least as an on-site observer. I also enjoyed the character Grace Roberts, a British school teacher with an independent spirit and clearly an example of feminist tendencies going back more than 200 years. The thousand folks who attended the premiere gave the film a very warm reception.",1
8,"I really liked this demon based anime, it's the first time I've ever seen twins as the main characters so it was really exciting that they got to work together in order to kick their biological fathers ass lol. I was sad though that their adoptive father was killed by Satan himself and been dragged into ""the pit of hell"". It was very interesting that the twin boys were different from each other. Rin is more like an arrogant inpatient dude who's always distracting himself whereas his twin brother Yukio is a focused individual who just wants to save the world and a pure gent! They are both badasses though don't get me wrong!I even wanna say kudos to all the English dub actors, they were phenomenal in doing their jobs well as their characters! I thought the anime was really entertaining and very well done, I'm giving it a 8/10!",1
8,"It's not easy to review an anime, but, this one can be described with a few words: it was good. The characters were lovable and the universe is interesting and full of action. However, the main key of this anime is the comic element that is all over the place. The main character, especially, is easily likable as he is easy going and funny. In addition, the animation is good, full of colour and fast fight scenes. Finally, the story is okay, kind of complicated towards the end, but I'm hoping that the next season will clear some things up, as the final episode kind of ended a bit short.",1
7,"This series is very entertaining. There is a lot of action and interesting concepts. There are a lot of scenes and episodes that are really dumb, but I just find it funny. I know that a lot of people would get frustrated to sit though 5 minutes of backstory for a cat in a semi-filler episode, but I just laugh through it. The animation is pretty good for the most part, and there is a lot of attention to continuity. The story has a lot of plot holes and continuity errors, but the animation is great. I can see how a lot of stuff in this series would make people annoyed, but I just find it funny. Even if you don't like every episode, this show is really entertaining. I would recommend this series.",1
9,Rin Okumara is a half demon and half human who inherits blue flames from his deceased father. After his adobted dad passes away he joins true cross academy alongside his brother Yukio Okumnura where he trains to become an exorcist.I really enjoyed this anime. A1 Pictures seem to be holding a good standard with their products.I thought it was nice how all of the characters were different in their own ways in personality and features. Especially with how polar opposite the brothers are.The dub cast was pretty good as well Bryce Papenbrock and Johnny Yong Bosch were the highlights of the dub.This is a pretty anime to watch on netflix.,1
10,"I'm always on the look-out for new supernatural anime to watch or manga to read. Then I had come across pictures for this series was curious about it. I had come across the original manga and I thought it was really awesome; I had read up to volume seven. Of course I think both manga and anime series are awesome too.It has been a long while since I had finished Season One on Netflix, but all I could remember is this: Raised by a priest exorcist named Shiro Fujimoto, Rin and Yukio Okumura are twin brothers living in a monastery. But during a demonic attack and Fujimoto getting possessed by Satan himself, Rin learns that he and his brother are in fact Satan's half-blooded sons. Then Fujimoto kills himself. So fueled by vengeance, Rin decides to become an exorcist himself to defeat Satan, and he enrolls in a cram school along with other would-be exorcists with Yukio as their professor.You know I'd started to hate Izumo Kamiki for being a total b***h for making a fool out of Shiemi Moriyama (the main lady). Also I had thought Izumo's only friend Noriko Paku left cram school for just not keeping up, but also she the disappointment she has for her for the way she treated Shiemi, when she only wanted their friendship.All in all, I love every bit of this awesome TV series, and I wish it was on North American DVD.",1
9,"I first encountered this a few years back when I read a few volumes of the manga but eventually fell off track with the books as a whole, however I can happily say I'm glad I came back to this series. With this, the sequel film and follow up series ""The Kyoto Saga"" now available on Netflix I've decided to power through them and boy did I make the right choice! This show was truly a fantastic watch and easily up there with some of the best anime I've seen of all time. Fantastic character, deep and thoroughly established world, and an amazing spectacle/scale as the series unfolds it's a masterpiece to be honest. Apparently deviating off book much like Game of Thrones the handover is seemless and has a fitting end after setting the stakes at a ridiculous level, there's so much to say I could be here all day so I'll round it off by saying a few things, note that the final 6/7 episodes are discounted when watching the Kyoto Saga, secondly and finally definitely give this a watch",1
6,"I have to admit that I did find this show ok. The plot was pretty much your typical shonun jump series. A boy who is a half demon wants to become an exorcist and take down satin. Together with his brother, they enroll into a excorist school and learn the ropes of being an excorist. I have seen this type of story FAR too many times. But I feel like it is done quite well. The characters are enjoyable and charming, the animation is pretty good and the story is ok. I feel like the final few episodes felt a bit too rushed, but there is a reason. It dis suprise ke when I found out why the laet few episodes were rushed, but I will explain it in my Kyoto Saga review. This was the first anime in a long, LONG time were I actually watched the dub firsr. I do have mixed feelings with it, but not what yoy are thinking. Firsr off, I cannot stand any of the male voice acting, especially the really old characters. Rim's voice actor I think was the guy who voiced Eren Yeager in Attack on Titan and thought he sounded good. The only male character who sounded really good was Yukio. That voice acting waa one of the best male voice actors I have heard in a while. But that's it, all the male's sound AWFUL. On the other hand, all the female characters sound AMAZING, which is ironic. So, all in all, a pretty sub standard show, but if you are getting into anime for the first time, give thos show a watch.",1
7,"Blue Exorcist isn't really that spectacular and it has several problems, but that does not mean it is a terrible watch. You'll enjoy yourself while watching it, there just isn't, much more than pure entertainment. If you're okay with that then, you'll enjoy this show then I recommend it. If you don't like that, then don't watch it. Now on to the problems: I never felt like any of our characters really grew in their abilities throughout the show. In all honesty I felt their skill level was exactly the same from when they were fighting basic demons all the way to when they're fighting Satan. It might be forgivable for the side characters to not show that much growth as the main character is much more important, but our main character, Rin Okumura, doesn't show any advancement either, and I take serious issue with that. Next problem is the pacing. I think they tried to condense too much content onto too few episodes, which makes me wish there were about 50 episodes rather than 25. Towards the end things get really rushed. It's like one second everyone is still basically trainees then they're fighting the most powerful demon out there. I would have liked it to slow down and take its time. As I said before though, it does offer up a pretty decent dose of pure entertainment, so watch it if you have nothing better to watch. 6.8/10",1
5,I don't mean it in a bad way but this is so insignificant and doesn't seem to really pick up the pace,-1
8,"I watched this first back in high school, and re-watching however many years later, it's still a super fun series. Filler episodes don't feel like filler, and while the end of the season is kinda rushed, it's still a fun and dramatic wrap-up.",1
7,"Season 1 (2011):
When an action anime meets Christianity this happens. It's a really unique idea and it has some good scenes and sequences.
I thought it could have done better at times and some parts were pretty predictable, but that's to be expected seeing as all the characters are high school age.There's something for everyone to get out of it, however I wouldn't show it to someone who's never seen anime.",1
7,It had some potential but wasted. The MC is dumb. Big dialogs but doesn't give the vibe.,1
9,"On paper, this show appears to be a number of clichés of the supernatural anime subgenre. Youths going to an exorcist academy to fight demons and the drama and hijinks that occur along the way. 9/10 times I find that type of anime to be very standard and underwhelming, but this series seemed to execute those cliche's in a manner that made this series surprisingly engaging.I have a family member who went through film school who has told me that you can have the most derived and clichéd story, but it still can be superb, it's all about the execution.Now this series was not even close to the stand out originality of series such as Cowboy Beebop, Attack on Titan, Trigun, and such but it stands on its own because of an engaging cast of characters, especially the two main characters. The twins. This series may not go into the depth of some of the above mentioned series but it has great themes of friendship, being an outcast, family and such. And I'm not much of a fan of the chibi thing, and it didn't at all get on my nerves or unnecessarily break from the drama as I've found in other shonen series with chibi.Overall, not one of the top animes out there but highly recommend watching for any anime fans out there.",1
9,"I'll be honest, finding a new anime to watch has always been hard for me. Starting a new anime is like getting into a hot tub, if you jump in too quickly, chances you'll sprint out as quickly as you hopped in. But if you slowly ease yourself in, you'll adjust to it and enjoy the experience. That's how it was when I started watching Blue Exorcist. As a fan of Soul Eater, I enjoy anime that can take themselves seriously, but know when to joke around, and are not heavy on nudity and swearing. And Blue Exorcist fits the bill. I like the characters, I like the set up. I only have two questions. 1: How can some exorcists summon demons when exorcists and demons are suppose to be enemies? And 2: Why do so many anime take place at schools? There's this one, Soul Eater, Kill la Kill, Ouran Host Club, etc. Anyway, I still enjoy this anime, and I highly recommend it if you loved Soul Eater.",1
10,"This was my second anime after Seven Deadly Sins. That was back in 2018. I had fallen in loved with it but hated the ending because it meant there was only one season. I fell in love with every character and plot. However, you need to only watch it until about the end of episode 15 or 16. There is a second series (season two on Netflix) that is true to the manga.",1

Overall this show is amazing from the characters to the story, this show is original, I haven't seen anything like this before and even through season 3 is postponed due to the low income it doesn't matter but I hope we get it soon I miss this series and so do many fans i reviewed this show is 1080x1920p in English dub I have watched this at netflix But you can find this show at any relative manga websitesTom crew",1

9,"This anime will keep you entertained, it has a great storyline and makes you feel good. I highly recommend it if you are looking for magic or shounen animes....",1
4,Had potential but lost interest before the end. Overall I found the anime boring,-1
7,"The first two episodes are pretty good and quite intense. It was the kind of thing I would expect to scar people for a long time, if it happened to them. However the main character, Rin, doesn't seem to phased by it and neither should you, because it doesn't remain that intense. Allot of the time it is quite light hearted and hugs solve allot of problems. Generally the series is very short and as such all of the character's emotional turmoil is dealt with pretty quickly. In fact the main characters main emotions are righteous anger and puppy mode, which you might not realize you will love but you probably will. This doesn't mean there aren't any emotions, just don't expect characters to be discussing their feelings that much. The main struggles characters face are to do with friendship, how they deal with their past and finally understanding others. A good portion of the show is like a high school drama, all about making friends, passing tests and keeping secrets. The end of the show really speeds up, this is because the anime overtook the manga and rushed to the end. It is not as bad as other endings that are like that but there are some things that are skipped and don't seem to the same.For example I feel weird saying Satan is not such a bad guy.The demons are appropriately horrifying, excluding ones you are supposed to like. They look like they are part monkey and wag their tales like puppies. If you are watching subtitles hope they aren't in yellow like mine were because allot of the floors are yellowy. The English dub is fine except for the first two episodes where the voice acting is just less intense than what's going on. In summary I liked it, I liked the characters, they were all pretty bad arse but still lovable. The premise and events were interesting and I thought about them a bit, but I was left thinking some things should have been explored more. Some things were a little freaky but there was plenty of cuteness too.",1

9,"Back in the late 1940s and through much of the 1950s, television was a new medium and quite different from today. While this may sound very obvious, how different might surprise you. Instead of the made for TV movies we came to expect in the 60s and 70s, TV brought us actual live productions--hour-long teleplays that were often written just for television. A few of these were amazingly good and were later remade into brilliant films (such as ""Studio One"" and its production of ""12 Angry Men""). Regardless, the shows were rarely dull and are well worth seeing today. Some are on archive.org's website for free download, some have been released by Criterion and a few by Alpha Video. Sadly, most sit in vaults--waiting to be discovered. My advice is try to see as many as you can--I've seen just about every one now available. Great acting, great scripts--of the many shows like this, ""Studio One"" is probably the best.",1
7,"I've always wanted to see the original, 1954 TV production of ""12 Angry Men"". The 1957 starring Henry Fonda is one of my all-time favorites and I love comparing movie versions of famous dramas to the original TV versions. When the Archive of American Television issued their Studio One Anthology which included the original version of ""12 Angry Men"", I had to have it. I wound up watching all 17 presentations, which cover the glory era of Studio One, which, with Playhouse 90, is one of the two most famous of the live TV anthology shows that, with the live variety shows, constituted the ""Golden Age of TV"", which reigned before the networks deserted New York for the west coast and filmed series with rigid formats.Watching 17 Studio Ones in 17 nights was an interesting experience, different of course then watching it once a week and watching these particular episodes over 8 years. The effect was slightly depressing while at the same time being enlightening. Part of the reason was that I was watching kinescopes, which, even when in relatively good condition, look a bit like dream sequences, fuzzy and dark. And 16 of the 17 episodes are dramas, one an opera, (a genre which I always find kind of dire). Afterwards I had an enormous desire to watch an episode of Hawaii Five-0, which, while it's also decades old, is shot on film out of doors and in the sun.We tend to think of the anthology shows of this era in terms of ""Marty"", ""Requiem for a Heavyweight"" and ""12 Angry Men"". Every week a classic. But it wasn't like that. The live dramas of the Golden Age had the advantage of being open-ended: you could write about what you wanted to, so long as you kept it clean and danced around the political mores of the times. But they also were hastily done, cheap, and were shot entirely in a studio, (Studio One's was in Grand Central Station, no less), and lacked the ""floor"" episodic TV had, even if they also lacked its ceiling. The worst Hawaii Five-0 is probably better than the worst Studio One, even if the best Studio One goes beyond anything Hawaii Five-0 could do. This is a sample of some of the show's best work but many of the 17 plays are nothing exceptional.The very first Studio One, (on TV, anyway: it had been on radio for a year), was ""The Storm"", on 11/7/48. It was redone 10/17/49 and that's the version we see here. It's just a ""woman in distress"" story, along the lines of ""Suspicion"", as an insecure young woman marries a ""nice guy"" and finds out he isn't. Other than its historical value, it isn't all that interesting. The oldest kinescope here is ""The Medium"", (12/12/48- the third ever Studio One), a Menotti opera chiefly interesting, (to me, anyway), because the producer of the stage production upon which it's based was Ephraim Zimbalist Jr., a decade before he played Stu Bailey on ""77 Sunset Strip""The best thing about these old shows is the faces- the many recognizable actors, most of them early in their careers, who appear. Jack Lemmon, in perhaps his first appearance before the cameras, (6/22/49), plays the sort of nice young man, (an aspiring songwriter), that he would become famous playing in the next decade in ""June Moon"". Eva Marie Saint, also an early appearance, plays the girl he falls for. Edward Andrews, a comical or occasionally menacing businessman in 60's films and TV shows, plays a more established songwriter. David Opatoshu, whose stock in trade was intellectual leaders, (see Star Trek's ""A Taste of Armageddon""), here plays a window washer who anticipates Ed Norton of The Honeymooners. But the play itself is nothing special.Charlton Heston first made a name for himself on this show and appears as Heathcliffe is a reasonable adaptation of ""Wuthering Heights"". The problem with such adaptations is that they had to be shoehorned into an hour and cut for Betty Furness's commercials. We get the beginning of Julius Caesar, in which Alfred Ryder does Mark Anthony's speech without Marlon Brando's passion but with a wry intelligence that was probably closer to what Shakespeare intended. It's fun to see perennial TV bad guys like Ryder and Bruce Gordon, who plays a Centurion, in non-bad guy classic roles. Most of the cast of this one turned up on ""Perry Mason"" over the years, multiple times.I liked Cyril Richard as Pontius Pilate in and Easter special from 1952. A 1953 version of 1984 with Eddie Albert and Lorne Greene is powerful, (but the most depressing of all). Greene's deep voice works as well for the head bad guy as it did for the head good guy on Bonanza- it could be as frightening as it was reassuring.The one comedy is ""Confessions of a Nervous Man"" from 1953 with Art Carney playing George Axelrod in a story of what it was like to write a hit play, ""The Seven year Itch"", (he even drops the names of Bill Wilder and Marilyn Monroe, who were preparing the 1955 film version). Audiences of the day knew that Art Carney was capable of a lot more than playing Ed Norton but that's all anybody sees today.The greatest legacy of the live anthologies was the opportunity they gave for talented young dramatists. Gore Vidal wrote ""Dark Possession"" (2/15/54), which examined split personality three years before ""The Three Faces of Eve"" and ""Summer Pavilion"" (5/2/55), an homage to Tennessee Williams. Rod Serling provided ""The Strike"", a powerful drama with a great performance by James Daly who has to order an air strike that will kill some of his own men. (It anticipates the Twilight Zone episode ""The Purple Testament"".) He also wrote the last one in the collection, ""The Arena"", (4/8/56), a drama of Congress that turns ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" around: the veteran Senator turns out to be the good guy while the new guy wants to destroy him. It also anticipates Vidal's ""The Best Man"" in that the younger Senator, (Wendell Corey), is tempted to use McCarthy-like tactics against this rival but finally declines to do so.But the writer who got the biggest reputation from Studio One is Reginald Rose, who became famous for ""12 Angry Men"" and for ""The Defenders"", the pilot of which was done on Studio One in 1957 (not included in this collection but I already had it: it's the one ""Boston Legal"" used because it featured William Shatner 50 years ago: the original is much better). He also wrote ""The Remarkable Incident at Carson Corners"" (1/11/54) and ""An Almanac of Liberty"" (11/8/54), both of which feature impromptu trials- the first by children and the second by some mysterious force that stops time. Both are artificial and preachy. Much better is ""The Death and Life of Harry Benson"" (5/31/54) with Skip Homeier as a soldier pretending to be a deceased buddy so he can have a family and ""Dino"" (1/2/56), which made Sal Mineo a star in a semi-autobiographical role that was also done as a movie the next year.Ms. Furness's commercials are interesting if a bit jarring. Somehow the fact that she's doing them at the same time the dramas are being presented, with just a flat between them is a little disturbing, especially when we've just left a desolate Korean outpost like the one in ""The Strike"". A filmed commercial seems more distant and easier to tune out. The technology of those appliances Betty is hawking is not so different now than it was then and those refrigerators, ranges, washers and dryers look a lot more solidly built that the junk I've got in my kitchen now. Where can I get them?Ultimate, the feeling one gets is of peering back into the mists of time. ""The Medium"" was broadcast 60 years ago. If the players in it could watch something that was 60 years old then, they'd be watching something from 1888. Jack Lemmon was not yet 24 when he acted in ""June Moon"" and died seven years ago at the age of 76. Elizabeth Montgomery appears in ""Summer Pavilion"" at age 22, young, talented and beautiful. She died 13 years ago at the age of 62. Eddie Albert, who lived to be age 99, co-stars with Norma Crane, who died at age 44. Virtually all the performers in these old kinescopes left us, many of them long ago.But, thanks to the Archive of American Television, they are still with us.(First posted to the IMDB message board in 2008)",1
6,"I understand there is a sequel made for this film; I do not know how wise that is because there will not be the same suspense element that this one had. This film is both tragic and scary. It is tragic because there is a chance that part of the strategy of this film may be initiated by the government at some point in the future. We already have tremendous pressure on our young adults with standardized testing like the SAT, GMAT and several other thinning devices. It is not hard to imagine more stringent ones down the line. However, when it comes to population control; it probably would not start with high school students; it would start with prisons. All the prisons in a country could easily be eliminated and turned into slave labor, like the people in this film. But that entire population is less than 1% of the population. We would have to come up with 4.5% from other sources. Hospitals could provide some. Old age homes could add to the number, and eliminating politicians could make up the rest of the difference. Most likely, however, if there were a real MATH elimination of the world's students, China would hardly be affected at all, and the US would probably lose over 9% of their high school students; but that wont happen anytime soon. Good luck with that idea.",1
3,"""Warning, lock down is now in progress. 30 seconds 'til lock down.  Testing to begin in 15 minutes.""  If you want a perfect example to show how to transform a rather  original movie into a typical teenage story that can be followed by an  infinite number of sequels, ""The Thinning"" is the right movie for that.  Admittedly, at the first moment I found the basic idea masterful. A  sort of ""The Purge"" on an academic level. It turns out that the natural  resources of planet Earth are no longer sufficiently present and  livable space is limited because the oceans have appropriated land (due  to the global warming I presume). The world decided to take drastic  measures. In the U.S. they found the ideal solution. And it's not what  you'd think it'll be. Nope, no birth control or the elimination of  older folks who are terminally ill. The bright idea is that school-age  youngsters need to undergo an ultimate final exam. You had to endure  panic anxiety when it was the period of exams again at school? Well,  this would be your worst nightmare in that case. You don't pass this  exam, there's not even a possibility for a resit. This way they attempt  to reduce the population by 5% annually.  So far the ingenious part of the film. I honestly admit that the images  made me feel slightly uncomfortable. Especially when I saw those  innocent little children taking their first ""Thinning"" exam and I  suddenly started realizing that some of them won't have a bright  future. The rest is as predictable as it can get and at times it's  really terribly ridiculous and unrealistic. I could live with once  again that idyllic image of a superior America and that they are using  this process so that a more intelligent population would arise. As a  result the U.S. would become the best country in the world once again.  Stunning. They'll achieve this by eliminating all the dumb kids. A  revolutionary idea that'll disgust you at first, but at the same time  it's so fascinating that your curiosity flares up again and you'll keep  looking intensely.  But then ridiculous events start to rule. When someone uses camera  images to figure out a password or someone tries to pick up a tiny pin  lying on the floor 3 meters far with a magnetized iron wire, I start to  sigh again. Add to this the obligatory romantic slant with a momentary  mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, and I start groaning even more. Anyway, I  was wondering why the unfortunate students who didn't pass, needed to  be disinfected once more. Admittedly, afterwards it became clear. What  I didn't expect was the fact it was all so predictable. Halfway through  I could enumerate roughly what was about to happen and how it would  end. Only I didn't foresee the ultimate ending. And this ending  irritated me the most. An open end in such a way that a follow-up  appears to be self-evident. And everybody knows what I think of  sequels.  If you think about it more deeply, this film actually is a little  reflection of our society at present time. On a political level strings  are pulled, so a situation turns out better for those that rule.  Wealthy and influential families sometimes have an advantage. Obtaining  a scholarship because someone excels in sports, and thus it's not  necessary to have a high I.Q., is something that exists in the U.S.  nowadays. And the ordinary students are as always the victim (even  though they have the correct number of brain cells). All in all a  shocking subject with some acceptable acting, even though it's a  low-budget film. Had they made a different ending, my opinion about it  would probably be milder. Now they have more or less a limp commercial  excuse to come up with some more sequels.",-1
1,"I don't normally swear but by god after i had watched this abysmal effort i had to so please forgive me IMDb its not my normal modus operandi.Terrible acting especially by Napoleon Dynamite clone Logan Paul - apparently he is some sort of vine social media z-list celebrity but he is butt ugly and has zero persona and acting skills and actually made me want to turn it off in the first 5 mins but due to my OCD i had to watch it to the end!The movie copies what has already been done to death with Hunger Games and The Purge = It seems the movie scene these days is all about either copying what has already been done or remaking old classics badly! Zero originality - all these producers have to do is pick up a copy of 2000AD comic from the 80's and make a movie like BLACKHAWK, WOLFIE SMITH, ROGUE TROOPER, FIENDS OF THE Russian FRONT, MELTDOWN MAN OR PLANET OF THE DAMNED - There are literally hundreds of good ideas from that era waiting to be made!Seriously if you are going to make a Scifi movie like this you really need to spend a little more than 100k and it shows.The whole movie looks like it was filmed in the corridor of my old school for 50p and a bag of monkey nuts!!!The main baddies looked like the Vinnie Jones thugs from the Arnold and Stallone movie Escape but a hundred times worse and i never thought i could say that about Vinnie ""the untalented"" Jones but they make him look average.And who was the main bad guy doing his bad attempt at a Danny Trejo impression - JEEZ.This is seriously ordure and shouldn't have been made its that bad!Apart from the overtly politically, leftist, limousine libtard bias we seem to see in every film these days and which really makes me mad but what is even more annoying is they seem to be catering so much for ""THE 100"" yoof viewers low intelligence and bland story lines - its actually a tragedy for the movie industry if this is what going to the cinema is to be replaced with Amazon, Netflix, Youtube rubbish like this - this would probably have fitted into being an episode of Black Mirror...Maybe but it certainly didn't deserve to be made into a movie.I gave it 1 only because of the rather excellent end credits music and for the relief that is was finally all over!",-1
6,"The basis of the plot is more or less the same as 'The Hunger Games' the exception that the teenagers aren't sent out on a island or whatever to fight to the death but instead the choice of who deserves to live is based on a written test.Now that said there still is some action in it but I'm not gonna get into any details as that would kind of spoil it a little bit.The leads are played by vine artist and youtuber Logan Paul (yeah I don't know who that is) and Peyton List (who's an actual actress go figure) anyways they are... okay... Even though the characters and plot is underdeveloped it was still okay to watch (probably just once though) that said I don't think it's worth the 6 pounds it currently costs to stream it on Youtube, ridiculous price (but that might change).5.5/10",1
1,"This movie has no reason to exist. It's one of the worst things I've ever seen and only partly due to the casting of Logan Paul as the protagonist. I'm no fan of Mr. Paul and his Youtube shenanigans but I know he's popular with the young crowd. Problem is, he's not a good actor. In fact everybody seems to be sleepwalking through their roles in this but that's only part of the problem. The rest of it is they took an interesting concept for a dystopian future and turned it into an unbelievable and frankly boring piece of crap.Nothing makes sense in this movie. Absolutely nothing. Things happen because they're supposed to happen in the script but there's no lead up or reason for them. The story itself contradicts it's own narrative. This seems to have been directed and edited by somebody with ADHD because honestly it was cut so badly I didn't know what I was looking at half the time. Of course it's a ""Youtube Red original movie"" that might explain it. Hey, it works on Youtube in a two minute video, it's going to work for a full length one right? Wrong. Some real actors in the lead and a better script and director and maybe they could have made something that people would want to watch instead of just a product to be consumed.",-1
6,"The culling of dumb people. Seems like a good idea, unfortunately I'd probably be culled along with them lol. The film itself turned out pretty good. I think people should be judged by their social media comments instead and get rid of the a-holes of the world.",1
1,"(dear IMDb staff, can you please not delete my reviews because Trump supporters don't like my OPINION? Or because they're right wing, pro-American sycophantic butt kissers? Thanks! Otherwise, please email me the reason why you let my reviews be deleted by right-wingers) So, to solve global warming issues via reducing the population, Americans voted for a law that allows the slaughter of school aged (6-18) kids. That's a ridiculous premise, only put there to invoke fear of any government (except of course, STATE governments, which are magically exempt of abuse..... Texas, anyone?). Anti-government flicks like these always utterly FAIL to make clear that such measures are NOT imposed on ""the people"". The people actually VOTED FOR THAT. Like they did with Trump, they actually are gambling that nothing bad will happen to THEM, only to ""other people"" (blacks, Latinos, the poor etc.). And like with Trump, they will discover too late that this isn't so: they TOO will get culled (kicked out of the health care system, see their jobs exported to China). Just take a look at West-Virginia to see the effects of proud rednecks getting exactly what they voted for: sheer misery.The acting, aside from Peyton List is so-so. The lead guy is also way too square jawed, and is kind of repulsive to look at. His chin looks like a pick axe, it's actually like he's a comic book/CGI version of someone real. The production value is not that bad, but since almost everything takes place in the school that's no great accomplishment.The film completely fails to make clear why population reduction via childmurder is preferable to either making abortion freely available to everyone or, simply using green energy, or even nuclear. It seems other countries, like China, ARE TOO, doing exactly that and are of course much more humane than America. Of course, being more humane is quite easy for China if America is acting like Dylan Roof and is BUTCHERING LITTLE CHILDREN. Anything other than that is more humane. Far-fetched? Considering Trump just took health care from NINE MILLION kids, and no-one in the media is making a big stink about it... nope.1/10 The Melancholic Alcoholic.",-1
1,"I mention the following because I would just like to let all those childish numb-nuts who object to anyone saying anything against people they admire that...
(1) before watching this film I had no idea who Logan Paul was... (2) I don't care a toot who Logan Paul is or that he is a web celeb, influencer or whatever else that makes for the modern world web whackercracker; just made that word up especially for this review! :)At first you get a feeling that this is just another teenage angst film; you know...like The Hunger Games but definitely not like The Purge films. The fact that this only had a budget of 1 Million dollars - $1,000,000 - has in no way been the cause of the complete lack of tension, excitement, thrills and spills it could have had, should have had and should have been been. The choice of Logan Paul, as Blake Redding, wasn't the best choice I felt because, it was like watching a corpse trying to be a method acting wooden dummy; I honestly don't think I am being too harsh with that descriptive assumption. This to me was a dystopian style film (as has been said in synopsis decscriptions) that had all the capabilities of being like the Orwellian '1984' corruptive dehumanizing society found in said film. Oh wait a minute...what am I saying? That kind of society has been imposed on us already and we are already living the dream. Just one thing wrong...the dream is a freakin' nightmare!The whole film never really fires up at all and the only person who had anything like an interesting role is Callum Worthy who plays Kellan Woods and is the reason the film gets a 1 star from me. Everything from camera work to the blatantly obvious screw ups just made for a dreary drab waste of time. The ending is terrible and it doesn't get any better for the viewer because there is a sequel! I just watched it back to back with this one and I just can't fathom out why I am being so cruel to myself :)A lack of directorial imagination is also the major downfall to what I believe could have been a blockbuster made on the cheap. Check out my review of the sequel but don't be expecting a marked improvement of ANY kind! Zzzzz.Now that I have seen both films I thought I would go online and find out who this Logan Paul guy is. The first thing I see is the Japanese story of his dumb ass stupidy and lack of respect (which leads to a sadder revelation that he has 23 million followers on YouTube who are obviously as callous and stupid as he his) but unfortunately thats what the world has to put up with from the youth/millenials of this age and time!YouTube management fare no better in morality because they let the whole bad boy thing go on (and thereby upping their social media bad ass rep - stupidy as I would call it - a lot further which at the end of the day makes them more money. They have constantly indulged in sub standard moral ethics; which is the very reason I don't give the social side of YouTube any attention whatsoever).",-1
4,"I was very sceptical about seeing this when I realised it was a YouTube production, I should really learn to trust my instincts a bit more. I was bored and gave it a go anyway, its full of plot holes, some really bad acting and has some ridiculous characters - its boring, clichéd and has been done (a lot better) many times before - if you have more than half a brain in your head or are older than 15 then give this one a swerve.",-1
9,"I just finished seeing this movie. Too bad you can only watch it on YouTube Red. I think it should have had a theatrical release. I wish it were at least on Netflix, On-Demand, and RedBox.This is a movie starring Peyton List. Peyton List is a young actress that a lot of people are familiar with. She's a natural beauty!! She's been doing shows on the Disney Channel, like Jessie. We also remember her as Holly Hills in the Diary Of A Wimpy Kid movies. She was Greg's crush and she was presented with beauty and charm in those movies. This is the only serious movie/action movie I'm aware of her in. She isn't presented for her beauty and charm in this movie like she was in the Diary Of A Wimpy Kid movies. She's instead presented as like an ordinary girl in high school, and intelligent. We see more of the romance between her and the guy she likes, than we ever between with Holly Hills and Greg Heffley. It's nice to see somebody we are familiar with finally in an intense role.Now, we can ask what made this movie great? First, as I mentioned the mood in my title, I'll start with the mood. The movie has a very strong mood to it presented throughout the film. It gives the film a dark atmosphere, and it's not one of the upbeat happy kids programs we remember Peyton List in. The whole idea of The Thinning sounds a little scary. The music, choreography of the scenes, the lighting, the reactions of the characters, the halls, the guys in the masks, and the idea make this a very dark film. The lighting really gives a mood to the film as a lot of the movie takes place in a building with dim red lighting. You could almost swear it was nighttime out, when it was supposed to be day.Another thing that makes the movie great is the idea. We've all taken tests, and we can be familiar with how intense we may be when we are studying for serious tests. We have taken tests in classrooms, and this movie reminds us of comparing our test scores to other students, along with our intelligence. Sometimes we may feel like our test scores determine our intelligence, and feel stupid if we get a low score, even though we should not feel that way. I'm sure you're at least aware that the plot of the movie is about executing people who get low test scores This movie gives a feel of having an intense test session at school as I'm sure most of us if not all of us have felt that way. But, it makes you ask yourself, ""what if a test I was taking at school was a life or death situation, like in this movie?""Another thing to mention which makes this movie great, is I thought this movie gave a perspective of the Holocaust. From today's perspective we see the Holocaust and World War II as events that happened a very long time ago, not really effecting us who are alive today. This movie will give you a little perspective of what if something like the Holocaust were happening today in America? At least that's what I thought, even while watching the trailer. It's supposed to take place in the future in an unspecified year. Some of the technology is a little ahead of what we have. But, we see the movie more of a perspective from today because it mostly looks like it takes place today.All in all, this movie was a good movie that will keep you focused on what happens, and feel for the characters. It's a different plot from what I've seen, and again makes us ask ourselves of what if a school test we took, would be a life or death situation depending on our score. That's a scary thought. I'm so happy we finally see Peyton List in a serious role. I'd recommend this movie if you're up for an action movie with a dark mood. This would be it.I really enjoyed the movie, but I'd give it a 9 because of the ending, eliminating a point. The ending didn't really seem to make sense, and makes some of us want a part 2. But, the rest of the movie was enjoyable and I'd definitely recommend it.",1
7,"For the most part, because I'm in love with dystopian movies, I enjoyed watching this film. Set in a future Texas 25 years after each county voted on how to decrease it's population because of drought,high ocean levels and reduced resources. These types of stories are saturating the market and few are original or very good. This one is head and tails better then many. It has an interesting premise just not extremely creative or well thought out in it's undertaking. For a low budget B movie the acting is quite well done, direction good, cinematoghraphy/camera work competent, editing and score appropriately supportive of the story.Just a few things, based on personal taste.... The setting, supposedly futuristic is only evidenced by a few buildings and soldiers in weird masks and voices. Don't get me wrong. Id rather have an underplayed setting then cheap cg but I would of liked a little more demonstration of it being ""the future"" Either more sophistication and/or evidence of society being in a state that requires ""the thinning"" in the first place. If you like the dystopian subject, I think you will be surprised at how well done this movie was made. If it isn't a subject you are kinda fanatic about it may disappoint you.",1

Logan is just annoying when hes standing there breathing in this movie. plotholes galore i wont spoil anything if you want to feel like pulling out your hair out of stress just watch this movie. only positive reviews are from his fans from youtube and he somehow has over a million of those.",-1
2,"When your ""movie"" is abysmal?! the plot/writing is laughable, and not in a comedic way whatsoever. this is extremely low budget, like the whole time i was looking for bruce willis.the absolute WORST part of this flaming train wreck is the casting. WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MINDS PUTS A VAPID, IGNORANT, UNWORTHY NARCISSIST, who should be wearing a helmet at all times to protect his soft little head IN A MOVIE?! i mean ""movie""... youtube is not only the most annoying video app that literally PATHETICALLY begs you EVERY TIME YOU LOGIN, to sign up for their premium service.... FU🐓K Y🍭U I WILL NEVER GET IT ON PRINCIPLE DUE TO HOW ANNOYING YOU BEG! YouTube original programming is a joke. HARD PASS ALWAYS",-1
7,"The acting was pretty good. All unknowns I think.The premise is fairly up to date. The idea that the government decides who lives and dies based on some idea that there are too many people on the planet is being toyed with today.Agenda 21 is a climate change control program that will allow government to decide where people are allowed to live in order to save the planet. That's a real program that may come into play soon.I liked the part where the little kids are shown propaganda films on how to make the earth happy by allowing themselves to be killed off. It's pretty scary when you think of how it could happen to us today if we don't push back on the far left climate change nonsense.I'm not sure how overpopulated the earth was in this scifi world, but today we hear people say there are too many on the planet when in reality we could fit everyone on the planet in an area the size of the state of Texas living no closer together than in NYC. Hard for many to believe, but it's a fact. We definitely have plenty of room today.In that respect, I liked the way they touched on this political issue and made a very good adventure out of it.Some complained of the ending, but I thought it was very good. I won't say what happens, so there's some mystery left.All in all I was pleased with this movie. I see lots of garbage, and this was definitely not that. There were a few flaws, but they were easy to overlook.",1
9,"I saw the trailer and thought that this might be a good one. Than I read the bad reviews here on IMDb and wasn't so sure anymore. But I gave it a go and was pleasantly surprised! I gave it a 9 star rating, for an 8,5 movie for being really exciting and entertaining. I watch A LOT OF MOVIES... and I like thrillers and this was a genuine sci fi thriller I enjoyed.The concept of the story is horrifying as only the brightest students of The United States get to live and the children are tested each year to see if they either fail or pass. The acting was fine and I got to like the characters. It was an intense ride and a nice pass of my time, so if you would like to have a nice evening and see a thrilling movie that will entertain you, this is the one for you. It's not brilliant, but good enough!",1
9,"A very cool movie, of young people in a possible future, but what is more instigate is that the film makes us reflect on the power, on the norms that arrive to us and the form of application. A movie that is simple, but it leads you to great reflections, especially on the system that corrupts everyone.It is a film that touches us deeply, we see how it is done and it arms the injustices. The transition to university life for every young person is a crucial stage in life, and imagine if there were as shown in the movie, uauuuuuuuu.A multi-skilled young filmmaker, Michael J. Gallagher, writes, produces and plays, as well as directing, all at age 29. It says in IMDb that: Michael Gallagher is a leading trans-media writer / directors with over 1 billion views in his online videos, collaborations and viral marketing campaigns. Among the films he directed I quote ""Famous Web"" (2016), ""The Face of Death"" (Smiley - 2012) and ""Interns"" (2014). On ""The Face of Death"" Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times said: ""a surprisingly effective low-budget horror film ...."" The actors perform a great performance, starring Logan Paul from the great ""Space Between Us ""(2017) and actress Peyton List who has also appeared in"" The Sorcerer's Apprentice ""(2010) and in"" Diary of a Banana 3: Dog Days ""(2012).",1
8,"The flaws are typical of movies that have young main characters accomplishing impossible things. But overall, it's a good movie. I believe the people giving it ridiculously low scores saw the possibly intentional similarities between the politician and Trump, hence the false accusations against Democrats, to deflect from the fact that someone like Trump just might be for an education system like this. Some might also be Chinese trolls who can relate to the stress of their final high school exam by which the students' university choiices, thus future is determined by their score. Others giving it low scores might've been disappointed there weren't f-bombs throughout, and that there was only a scene that suggested nudity without showing any, and another where a couple only strip down to their ""modest"" (no thong or cheeky) underwear, And, the other group are haters of the lead male character. But the character he plays needed to be his size, and the good-guy jock type. If you don't fit any of the 3 groups I mentioned, you just might enjoy it. My wife and I both enjoyed it, and I recommended to my friends on Facebook.",1
5,"I remember seeing this back awhile in 2018 and it was one of the most horrifying movies I've ever seen from 2016. This movie was a disorganized mess but I see where this was going. If you were on this movie and you got culled, our hearts go out to you cause you didn't make it. But movies that have went straight to streaming have spit out garbage cause they don't get the same treatment that big Blockbusters get when they all go out theatrical. And they also get their running time cut too. If you're gonna make a movie, make it longer than 90 minutes otherwise why cause it's just a waste of the studio money and finances.",-1

Unfortunately, i was really disappointed.
Poor acting but pretty actors and actresses. from some reason, Logan Paul frequently kissed many actresses without a written reason in the screenplay.
I could not find any relation between the characters with each other because that wasn't explained.
Even the ending didn't surprise me.
I understand there's a sequel but there's a limit for how much can I suffer.
Not recommended.",-1
4,"Just a few nitpicky things that will drive you nuts.1) This is a thinning of the population via testing scores. So why are all the security guards so stupid. Also, who is going to want to work at Burger Queen? 2) A test this important that can easily be cheated or manipulated..not likely 3) No funerals for the people killed? 4) I was gathering from the dialog that Texas has this test but other states may not. Why live there? (or in the USA if it the only testing country) 5) Did I mention the guards... not only are they stupid, they can't fight either 6) There is no twist at the end because wouldn't there be fewer people to take the test each year, hence no need to make LOTS of testing machines?",-1
6,"This movie would have been a 10 out of 10 from me, had they cast the leads with better actors. Set in a future where the least intelligent are ""thinned"" from the US population, it's an imaginative film inspired by themes from Trump era media zeitgeist. Children who fail an test are eliminated from the population, or are they? This film has a few nice twists along the way, with internal struggles in a corrupt and unethical public system.The wooden acting of the main female lead, unfortunately soured this film. Other character actors did a sound job of making-up for the short-fall, with a good character performances by the adults playing teachers, and other young people playing secondary characters. Most of the action sequences were reasonably well choreographed.I feel like this is a film that will date quite rapidly as the political and social landscape of the US changes. However at the moment it is topical and imaginative.",1
10,I'm shocked still at how great of a movie this was. There are flaws in the movie but I ignored them because of how much action was in the movie and the suspense kept me on the edge of my chair. The characters are very diverse and are all different. This movie has one of the best cast I've seen in years. the crazy part is the Thinning is low budget. The thinning should made it to the Theaters because of how amazing it was. Through out the movie I couldn't tell that it was low budget they did a great job through out the of making it look great. Well The plot and the writing are truly Spectacular. There are flaws in the movie but the greatness of the cast and writing is easy to look past.Give it a chance the movie might surprise you.,1
8,"An all too brief review of the history of women in Jazz, from the begginnings of the 1900s through modern day female musicians. These women had to face discrimination and diminished expectations from multiple fronts--particularly if they were African American, but nothing could keep them from doing what they loved--and many of the women were--and are, as good as or even better than the stars of thier day. Even though they often did not receive the credit they were due--privately, let alone publicly--for thier playing, their writing and arrangements, nothing could stop them. amd thier joy at making music still shines through.Filled with interviews, timely photos and film clips, this movie is a wonderful trip through time, and a reminder that while we've come a ""Long way baby"", a woman's journey towards full acceptance as an equal member of the human race is far from over. Overall well done. Would have enjoyed more time with the music, and more film clips of the performances, but I've few complaints. The pace was good, the hsitory memorable, and the women are just plain incredible. Recommended!",1
9,"After having seen and LOVED this production from Canadian Stratford, it was rather shocking and absurd to come to IMDb and see it have a rating of only 3.5 stars out of 10 (based on 115 votes at the time of this writing, late March 2021). That is of course ridiculous. These ratings are not made by Shakespeare appreciators. I was in awe of this production, which very successfully aims to make this hard-to-penetrate play understandable by emphasizing precisely what the play is all about: politics.Our main character, Coriolanus, is a warrior who detests all non-warriors, and has only scorn for all values that we would consider civilized. The play takes play at a time when the people of Rome are in revolt against their elites, demanding food and democratic power. Coriolanus, and the people around him (his mother, Menenius, Cominius, etc.), are part of the elite, and the play effectively chronicles the class struggle between the people and the elite. The people grow more and more powerful, eventually ousting Coriolanus, who sees no other recourse but to join with the Volscians, the enemies of Rome, and as one of their commanders, attempt to conquer Rome. But in the meantime, Coriolanus' own mother and the rest of the Roman elite have evovled to be more in line with the people, and they beg him not to destroy Rome. Surprisingly, he is moved by his mother's plea, and resolves instead to make a peace treaty between Rome and the Volscians. The leader of the latter, Aufidius, is not amused, and kills Coriolanus as a traitor at the end.This production is modern, to be sure - you won't see Roman garbs here. But no one puts this play on in Roman attire anymore. The play is so political that it BEGS to be some form of a reflection of our own current-day politics. As this opened, I was instantly engaged and caught up in it, quite amazed and impressed with the cutting-edge stagecraft on display here (a previous commenter, Fred_Walker, claims that the props are ""non-existent"" - he must not have seen the same play I did, or not understand anything about theater. All sorts of special effects were used to incredible and highly cinematic effect). Many filmed stage plays look too obviously low-budget, but this production *really* did not! It had so many great effects and such protracted sequences (like several minutes of driving a car from Rome to Antium!) that a low-budget impression was the farthest thing from my mind! Quite the contrary, this great production was much more of a ""spared no expense"" experience!My rule about rating is that I'm not generous with 10-star awardings, partly because the scale is meant to rate movies and not plays. There are only one or two truly exceptional plays that I have ever rated a 10. This production is not one of them - but let me say that it almost was! This is the best CORIOLANUS I have seen; better than the RSC production from the year before; better than the 2014 Tom Hiddleston version and better than the 2012 Ralph Fiennes movie. This Stratford Festival version helped me more than any of those to understand the structure, content and point of this play, and I was spellbound by the experience. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!9 stars out of 10.",1
1,"This is NOT a movie, but a play on a stage that was filmed. the costumes are literally 21 century street clothes and the props non existent. badly cast and amateur acting to top it all off. this suuuucked.",-1
1,Another of those terrible remakes in an attempt to rewrite history. Save yourself and avoid this at all costs.,-1
8,"I can understand why some may dislike this show, but although it is far from a perfect show I personally like it. Yes there are characters that are shallow and stereotypical especially Mandy and the premise is not the most original of all premises complete with some predictable story lines. But I do like the animation, which is clear and beautiful, the music is catchy, the action moves are cool and the writing is on the whole clever and funny even with the odd cringe-worthy moment. As for the characters, although Mandy especially will annoy people, including me admittedly, Jerry is likable and the villains are suitably devious. The voice work is solid, having vastly improved as the show progressed.Overall, not the very definition of awesome, but worth watching and while the criticisms are understandable and to an extent I agree with them Totally Spies does deserve a chance. 8/10 Bethany Cox",1
10,"I love this show so much! The older seasons are my favorites, I feel like the latest ones (or one) are not that nostalgic!",1
7,"I used to love this show and it still brings back memories, but things change and I wouldn't call this show bad, because it isn't. It's just personal issues. The setting is something we've seen many times before: young people trying to blend in with the average youngsters and simultaniously maintaining a secret life. They all three have their own personality, but in this case they are all three more or less obsessed with the latest fashion and boys. Those are my biggest problems, 'cause that kind of superficiality and consumerism personally turn me off, but now I have got that out of my system we'll take a look at what I LIKE about the show. Well, our three main characters go through relatable teenage girl issues, and that is good to bring those things up. Their chemistry is entertaining and their boss, Jerry, is really cool. I also like the episode or episodes where their school menace Mandy becomes a part of the team. It was hilarious. The missions they go on also bring up a lot of entertainment and nice looking locations with lots of humour. Go check it out. It is worth a watch.",1
10,"I was shocked,surprised and flabbergasted by the negativity I heard on the Internet; I have watched this show, and frankly I find it awesome! To me it is like the live-action series Charlie Angels, another favorite show of mine. Only the girls are teenagers and espionage spies; they could actually see their boss Jerry.It is very hard to choose which of the three of the spies is my favorite. So I would have to said it would be Alex the youngest out of the three. She is so cute and adorable! and also the type of next door girl person. I also love the anime-like animation - I love anime. So overall this show is awesome!",1
7,"I grew up watching this and I have to say, this was an interesting show. The characters are very air-headed, the suits they wore were bizarre and the scenarios they got themselves into were ridiculous. But nevertheless, it was entertaining.",1
6,Absurd adventures for the strange protagonists of this cartoon that in some ways reminded me of Kim Possible.In every mission or almost every one of our protagonists undergo a physical transformation and this made me think that someone in the production had some fetish.,1
4,"""Totally Spies"" is a French-American/Canadian Action-Comedy-Cartoon produced by the French company Marathon Production. This anime-influenced cartoon series debuted on TV year 2001.This series can also be called as a ""Charlie Angel's"" rip-off mainly aimed to children.Again I give you a SPOILER WARNING!!! Just to make sure readers don't read some spoilers by accident.Welcome to Beverly Hills, and meet Sam, Clover and Alex.These girls might look like just your typical movie-schoolgirls, as much of their everyday life mostly are used on stuff like fashion, boys and getting plagued by their annoying rival Mandy. But in seconds they turn into super spies by getting ""woohped"" by their boss agent Jerry, the leader of WOOHP, a secret organization for agents and spies. They all get to know some ""world problem"", and get some spectacular gadgets which look like ordinary things like a pen, bubblegum, mascara, hair dryer, etc. And there they go to investigate this ""problem"" in any place on the Earth, get eventually caught by either the villain or the henchmen, and get loose in order to stop the villain. And this happens in every single episode, unless there is some part-2-and-3-episodes.END OF EPISODE SPOILERS!!!And this series happened to be a worldwide success...This was one the series I often watched when I had Jetix on my cable-TV, this together with other series like ""Pokemon"", ""Digimon"" and ""W.I.T.C.H."" And then I say as good as too often, as I happened to watch several of the same episodes again and again. And please don't ask my why, but it simply happened when I still waited for new episodes to come up.However ""Totally Spies"" seemed to try to mimic the famous anime genre (Japanese animation) by using some of the typical ""anime effects"", but somehow fails to do it. The girls in the series might look cute, but sometimes get somewhat annoying; Alex tend to say some random joke which isn't funny at once; Clover tend to get too obsessed with fashion and boys sometimes...I can go on in all eternity if I wanted, but I don't think so. Yes, I have watched too much ""Totally Spies"" for years ago, but decided to drop the fifth season and so on, because I have better things to watch than this.If anybody is interested, season 6 have already debuted in France and Netherlands summer 2013. So I think the fans of this series can have something to look forward to. ;-)",-1
9,"I love this show, that's all I can say, I absolutely love it. Back when it first came out I don't recall it being that big of a hit, but it eventually grew a cult following over the years and nowadays many people (myself included) consider it to be one of the most underrated cartoons of all time.What makes the show so fun to watch is just how creative the missions the girls go on and the gadgets they use are, which opens the doors for so many creative opportunities. An example of missions would be stopping a former fashion model from kidnapping current models and turning them into Frankenstein-inspired abomination do get revenge for her career getting ruined. In terms of certain gadgets, you got a heat ray disguised as a hair dryer, a hair pin for picking locks, and jetpacks disguised as backpacks just to name a fewMy thoughts on the characters is a bit complicated admittedly and some of them happen to be the only issues I have with the show.
Sam is by far my favorite character in the entire show, I love how she's the most mature out of everyone and acts as the voice of logic, it's nice to have someone act as the straight person in the show and be the one who takes all the missions she and the others go on seriously, plus she's very beautiful to the point where I have a huge crush on her and she's played by one of my all-time favorite actresses Jennifer Hale, that's a pretty good deal if you ask me.
Clover is someone I have mixed thoughts on, on the one hand, she's very cute and pretty and it's relatable seeing her struggling with trying to impress guys or pursue her passion of fashion and beauty, but on the other hand, there are times where she can be a bit too arrogant because of it and she's a bit too immature at other times, I don't necessarily hate her, I just kind of wish she would take a chill and act less overthetop.
Alex I don't hate but I will say is the weakest of the 3, she's the naive one who usually never understands what's going on but there's not really anything that goes beyond that, plus her voice can get annoying to listen to at times, I don't hate her either but she and Clover aren't exactly as strong of a character as Sam.
Jerry is basically the show's Charlie, summoning the girls at the most unexpected times in some of the most wacky ways imaginable and sending them on their missions. It's very funny whenever he outdoes himself with the crazy ways of summoning the girls into the WHOOP briefing room and all the insane modes of transportation he keeps sending them on whilst outdoing himself almost every episode.
Mandy is honestly my biggest problem with the show. She's your typical self-absorbed over-achiever who's supposed to always be at odds whoever the main character is (in this case Sam, Alex, and especially Clover). The reason she's my biggest issue with the show is because she's the most pointless character in the entire series, she barely contributes anything to the story of any episode and exists solely to be a nuisance to the Sam, Clover and Alex, and on top of that almost every episode ends with her beating Clover at something she wanted to earn, which kind of makes a small portion of the show's formula frustrating, if you removed her from the show, I don't think it would really change anything.Overall, this show is such an underrated gem. It's got a creative premise with limitless creativity, spot on animation, stellar voice acting, a catchy theme song, mostly likable characters, and fun action. I'd go as far as to say I think it deserves to make a comeback one of these days, there's only so much you can do with a show like this.",1
10,"I LOVE THIS 90'S TV SHOW. Totally Spies is one of my favourite childhood programmes, you when you get older and then you randomly remember some of those old children programmes you used to watch well this is one of my mine. Every time it came on telly I would always watch it. One of my favourite characters has to be Sam because not only is smart but she also looks amazing and I think she always had the best fight scenes. One of my favourite moments from this TV programme has to be when one of the bad guys had a weapon that turned 21st century clothes into 80's clothes. If you like to watch 90's TV shows if you just like spy related shows then this TV show is just for you.",1
7,"It's the type of show you use as white noise while dozing off to sleep. It's very easy to tune in and out and not really miss anything, which I find kinda relaxing and necessary sometimes. It also has some really funny moments, and some of the episodes are low key dark. For example S1E7. The girls are framed for bank robbery. Jerry straight up doesn't believe they're innocent or make any attempt to hear their side. He doesn't even consider the fact they have no motive to rob a bank. These girls have done nothing but complete missions for him and save countless lives. Not to mention they all come from extreme wealth and I am sure their Whoop salaries aren't bad for teenage girls. Without due process Jerry immediately locks them up and tries to implant behavioral modification chips in their brains. One of the Whoop agents says to them with a smile ""You'll never have another aggressive thought as long as you live"".I give it a 7 because there are some things that really piss me off about this show. Like the fact the girls act real dumb/ditzy most of the time, but can somehow effortlessly operate aircrafts, submarines and complex spy tech. They're also highly trained in espionage, hand-to-hand combat, bungee jumping and bomb disposal. So why do they act so dumb? Also, how are they constantly sent on missions in the middle of the school day? They are literally gone for several days and somehow no teachers or parents ever seem to notice??",1
7,"I believe girls will be able to relate to this because there are girls who go boy crazy all the time. While this approach is risky and sometimes parents may or may not accept it, I think this cartoon did well in being within the age limits and it's added action is enough to make boys like it too. I'm not going to lie, I had a little crush on Alex when I was growing up! Maybe that's why I kept watching this show. Overall, good cartoon!",1
10,"Honestly, I am the biggest fan of old cartoons and still watch them religiously lols This show brings back so many great memories. Catchy theme song and love-able characters! The girls showed a great message on friendship throughout the show that I thought was heartwarming but the fighting scenes and the witty humor always had me cracking up (And still does!) . I hope no one tries to make a remake of this show because it was already perfect. Hollywood seems to always find the need to remake something. Leave perfection alone!",1
7,"This cartoon is so fetish, i really want to learn what were they thinking when this show was getting aired on TV.
nvm, this cartoon might be fetish, but i really want a sequel that is NOT fetish as this one. i liked and hated this cartoon, just like everyone does. and i want a sequel or a reboot for this whithout fetish moments. lol ik my grammar sucks",1
10,Its a great show but season 6 is kind of week. And it can be a little bit cringe at times but its very fun to watch and if you call this a fetish show you have problemes.,1
10,"Totally Spies is absolutely the best cartoon I've seen in years. I'm not counting anime, because anime shows are in a league of their own.The show is about three high school girls who are actually spies for a government organization called WOOHP - The World Orgaization Of Human Protection. Sam is the smart and sexy redhead (and my favorite character), Clover is the conceited and cute blonde and Alex is the airheaded and, uh, elegant brunette (and token African-American). Their boss is Jerry, a bald British guy. Jerry supplies them with girly gadgets, such as compowders/x-powders (compact computers), lipstick lasers, windtunnel 9000 tornado-blast hairdryers and the like. They take on evil toymakers, cookiemakers and various megalomaniacs. At school they contend with a rich, snobby girl named Mandy. Clover and Mandy always fight over boys.There are many stand-out episodes. I liked ""Boy Bands Will Be Boy Bands"", which has some witty dialogue. One boy band member says, ""We're just doing the boy band thing to jump start our acting careers."" I swear that's a reference to actor Mark Wahlburg, who used to be the lead singer of the boy band Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch. I'm not a fan of real life boy bands, but I love this episode. Then there's ""Alex Quits"", in which Alex does quit when she becomes jealous of new spy recruit Britney. The villain is a guy named Willard, who wants to slow down the world to a snail's pace. I love his voice.Speaking of voices, actress Jennifer Hale voices both Sam and Mandy. She also voiced Jessie in Jonny Quest: The Real Adventures. There are three DVDs with four episodes each. I wish there were season 1,2 and 3 boxed sets. I love season 4 so far. Now we need a theatrical movie.",1
1,"What are the high heels for Alex, Samantha and Clover in their costumes when the heels look like they are in a suit that does not show the length of the shoes, the size of the heel shoes, but they are glued to the foot with the suit, or are they put on their feet, or whether the overalls should first be put on, after which, after reading the overalls on the legs, the heels are placed on the foot.",-1
10,"The enthralling animated cartoon is counted on the children of any age. Spy pieces always interesting in fact. Characters of personages are perfectly neat. Clover is a coquette, likes to walk about shops and dreaming reason by a designer. Sam is a diligent student spending all the time on studies. Alex is a sportswoman, adoring animals. But not looking on distinction of characters, girls like to spend time together, both on tasks and out of them. It is desirable to mark the variety of plots. All very enthralling, intriguing and done with a mind.",1
4,"The first time I watched this, I was like ""cool! a new show!"" then I began seeing the flaws. The plot is almost always the same: bad guy is out for revenge, or out to take over the world. And the show goes like this: 1. They have a school/teen problem, which usually involves Mandy 2. they get woohp-ed 3. they get the mission and gadgets 4. they meet the bad guy, do kung fu stuff, save the day, blah blah blah.. 5. they go back to their teen/school problem. Also some of the show elements are unrealistic. And it's irritating how Clover and Alex care so much about boys! They also talk so superficially. And that freak Mandy with her nose up high and her voice that sounds so nasally!",-1
8,"I'm not gonna talk about the plot as if you're not already familiar with it thanks to other reviews (and just by watching a single episode, really).While the show follows a formula, by switching it up with memorable villains (years later my friends and I recognize villains from watching this show as preteens) and cool gadgets the show stays watchable and interesting.What makes this show truly good for a cartoon is its self-awareness and satire. While many will probably take the show at face value, it's supposed to be /funny/. Sam, Clover and Alex being ""like, total"" Beverly Hills teens is funny because it's non-problematic satire. It lightly pokes fun at the whole culture that's developed in these above-average rich areas where teens really don't need to worry about a lot, and it shows this by using every typical mannerism that they could've used. Despite this, the main characters aren't actually all that unlikable in my opinion, which is key to this show being watchable.On top of that, they're unrealistic spies, matching satire with fun mindless action.My only real gripe is inconsistency with intelligence / power. One episode they'll resort to hand-to-hand combat (and prove to be good at it), the next they don't / flee for no real reason. And at times I feel like they just don't think all that logically for no real reason (perhaps to move the plot along at times, but at times it doesn't even seem to serve any purpose other than to make it seem more difficult). It's a cartoon with flawed logic to begin with, but I don't think that's a real excuse. Just think of better problems if you don't want them to solve it too easily.The show, however, set out to achieve something and it achieves exactly that. With quickly paced episodes yet easy to follow plots the show is great for zoning out and having a good laugh.8/10, expressive animation, good voice acting, but repetitive and boring at times.",1
10,"This is the Best Show, I've have ever Heard, I Like the Girls wearing Spy Outfit, I Wish i wanted that.",1
6,"DEVIL'S EXPRESS is a cheap and trashy independent action/horror flick shot on the mean streets of New York and starring the one and only Warhawk Tanzania, the afro-sporting blaxploitation star of FORCE FOUR. That one wasn't so hot, but this film's a lot better, a mixed-up mini-epic of disparate themes and elements. For much of the running time it plays out as a straight kung fu epic, like FORCE FOUR, albeit with better choreography. Tanzania and his buddy beat up various goons who unwisely ambush them, and there's little time for characterisation or plotting in between. The horror content is where things get interesting. An Asian demon ends up residing in the subway, mutilating victims left, right and centre, and the kill scenes turn out to be grisly indeed with the excellent use of grotesque sound effects to accompany them. The make-up is basic but kept in the semi-darkness to look more effective, and it's all rather horrific and creepy, as many subway-set films are. DEVIL'S EXPRESS is one of those films where you can overlook the many flaws just because the premise and idea behind it are so intriguing.",1
3,"The Devil's Express is part blaxploitation, part horror, and part martial arts flick, but the film fails to do any of those genres justice, with an unlikeable protagonist, tepid frights, and some of the worst punching and kicking imaginable.The wonderfully named Warhawk Tanzania plays Luke, a black New York martial arts master who, accompanied by his drug-dealing student Rodan (Wilfredo Roldan), travels to China to complete his training. When Rodan finds an ancient amulet in a cave, he takes the trinket, and, in doing so, unleashes a bloodthirsty demon that follows him back to the Big Apple.When mutilated bodies begin to show up in the city's subway, the police believe it to be the result of a gang war between the blacks and the Chinese, but when Rodan joins the list of victims, Luke investigates and learns of the supernatural creature lurking in the dark and heads underground to settle the score.Technically inept (several scenes feature characters talking but we can hear no dialogue), poorly written (horrible jive street-talk is taken to the max) and dreadfully directed (the fight scenes are laughable), The Devil's Express is, without a doubt, a terrible film, but is still just about worth a watch to witness a possessed man with eyes like Kermit the frog, a Chinese man with an afro (a chifro?), and Luke's show-stopping gold velvet onepiece playsuit, complete with flares and button down shoulder straps.",-1
7,"Devil's Express was in my recommended Amazon Prime video list for some time. And now that I've just finished watching it, I wish that I could have seen it even sooner. This is the kind of movie that I feel like becoming an apostle for - it's a film that hardly anyone talks about and has probably never seen, but combines all of the elements that make it perfect for culthood - it's the perfect mix of blaxploitation, 1970's occult, tough guy cop and martial arts films, all in one off the rails package.When The Warriors came out, the distributor of this film retitled it as Gang Wars to try and make more money. And sure, it's about gang fights. It's also about so much more.Back in 200 B.C., Chinese monks get rid of an evil medallion by dropping it into a hole. That's where it stays until sometime in the 1970's, when martial arts teacher Luke Curtis (played by a man who has an even better real name, Warhawk Tanzania, who is also in Black Force) and his sidekick Rodan (no, not that Rodan, this guy is played by Wilfredo Roldan, also of Black Force) travel overseas on a spiritual journey. Sadly, Rodan can't erase the revenge in his heart, so when he finds the medallion, instead of resisting its evil, he takes it.When they get back to New York City, a demon possesses a Chinese guy and starts violence everywhere he goes, setting up a feud between the Blackjack and Red Dragon gangs. The cops try and keep things cool, but the martial arts action just can't be stopped.If you're looking for cameos, this one's got 'em, from Brother Theodore (The 'Burbs) to David Durston, the writer and director of I Drink Your Blood as a doomed 9 to 5'er!Also, if you're looking for a funky soundtrack, gold lame outfits, a villain named Lo Pan (yes, really), a final kung fu fighting monster that is wearing tennis shoes, Dolemite-esque chop sockery and the kind of movie that five different writers all making a totally different movie at the same time, then this film is exactly what you're looking for. You've got a hero cool enough to help train the cops, but also street enough to not trust them. You've got romance. And you've got fights with missed cues and nonsensical editing. Writing this review makes me want to watch this movie all over again.There's even a subplot where one of the new cops thinks that all of the murders and gang violence are the result of mutated pets that have been flushed into the sewer. And how does a martial arts instructor so devoted to harmony and bettering himself also let a coke dealer and gang leader learn from him? Why did Warhawk Tanzania do so few films? Why didn't they make ten sequels to this movie? When can I watch it again?",1
7,"The working title of ""Gang Wars"" was ""The Phantom of the Subway"" but it was first released as ""The Devil's Express"".The film mixes blaxploitation genre,American martial arts and horror flick and does this with huge enthusiasm.The acting is mostly wooden and Warhawk Tanzania is not as awesome as his name.The fights are well-shot and there is a decent amount of blood and gore.The film's running time is padded out by random inserts of not exactly important scenes for example the fight between two sleazeballs and karate waitress.The gang war and subway murders committed by amulet seeking demon are fun to watch.A trash classic.7 out of 10.",1
2,"The movie starts in China 200 B.C. according to the caption. Spooky music plays as a box is dropped into a cave. Next a man in black decapitates about five monks who just sit there praying. It seems things were weird back then.The lead is War Hawk Tanzania. He also played in 1975 ""Black Force"" a.k.a. ""Force Four"" which was another Blaxploitation movie. I have not watched that movie because I don't have a copy. I know where to get a copy but that is not on my ""To Do"" list.I think the most amazing thing about this movie is the 13 reviews posted here. I can't believe 13 people recently watched this movie let alone put in the effort to write a review. My effort here will be minimal. Everything to say about this stinker has already been said.In Chinese martial arts there is a simple hand gesture of greetings and respect. The right hand makes a fist and the open left hand folds over it. Any variation of this can be taken as an insult. This movie fails to get that gesture correct and consistent. I have watched thousands of these movies and practiced martial arts over thirty years. Nothing pushes my buttons more than when this gesture is mucked up in a movie. My other button is either improper hand position on a katana or returning a sword to the scabbard incorrectly.I rate this movie as ""Bad, but I have watched worse"". I guess that counts as two stars. I recommend no one watch this movie. There are many better bad movies out there and life is short.",-1
5,"This was the second and last of Warhawk Tanzania's only movie appearances, both starring vehicles. I guess he didn't catch on, no doubt because the movies weren't particularly well made and because by then both the blaxploitation and ""kung fu"" genres had passed their U.S. commercial peak due to oversaturation of the market with cheap knockoffs. He had the right look, and if he wasn't much of an actor, there were worse ones who were successful enough (particularly in martial arts cinema), so I guess it was more a matter of bad timing than anything else.""Devil's Express"" is a bit slicker than ""Black Force"" (confusingly, both have sometimes been called ""Gang Wars""), a little wilder and more fun. WT plays a karate master who goes with his buddy (Wilfredo Roldan as ""Rodan,"" the same name his character had in ""Force"") to a conference in Hong Kong. Afterward, they see the sites. Problem is, his buddy is a bit of an ***hole, and he steals an amulet from some ancient burial ground (or cave, in this case). So naturally once they get back to NYC, a demon spirit follows them, mostly holing up in the subway system and possessing the bodies of various unfortunate passers-by it's murdered in order to get back its stolen treasure. Police, the heroes' dojo, and a rival Chinese group of fighters all get caught up in the eventual mayhem.The mix of horror, martial arts and blaxploitation sounds like trash heaven, and ""Express"" gets about halfway there. It's fairly well-made on a B-pic level, and reasonably fast-paced, but despite the decent premise there's not much colorful idiosyncrasy to the characters or situations. (Apart from Rodan being an entertainingly snotty jerk, that is.) But the real problem is that neither the fighting or horror elements are developed sufficiently. There's a lot of fighting, and clearly most of the participants have at least some training. But the film is edited in a way that is pretty obviously covering for them--we get much kicking and ""thwack!"" noises but it's not very convincing as anything but faux-fighting. (There are even a couple moments when characters say ""Ow!"" in pain, even though we've just clearly seen their opponent's kick didn't connect.) The monster is introduced rather late, then kept largely out of sight. So, this is a promising mix of elements, but the fighting isn't very impressive and the horror is likewise also mostly ""cheated"" (people go ""Yaaagh!!!"" at something we don't see, then are presumably murdered offscreen).So, fairly amusing grindhouse action junk from the period, worth seeing once for those who like this sort of thing. But not the guilty-pleasure classic you might hope for.",-1
6,"Yeah, this one is a good ways away from being as awesome as it might have been. Which is not to say that its a complete failure, rather that those enticed by its combination of genres into thinking it might be some trash colossus should substantially downgrade their expectations. It reminded me most of some of the better works of Godfrey Ho, those films in which the cut 'n splice ninja flick maestro actually had an original script and a cast of semi capable performers. Inept, insane and idiotic in roughly equal measures, but conducted with verve and never dull. The inspired story is of martial arts school leader Luke Curtis who goes to visit his sifu in Hong Kong along with his shiftless buddy Roldan (though I preferred the subtitles in which his name was Rodan) who steals a sacred medallion and unleashes a demon, who returns to New York, possesses a Chinese man and sets up shop in a subway, killing at random and contributing to a race war between Chinese and black gangs. Lots of fighting ensues, as well as plenty of laughter. The attitude behind the writing seems to have been to cram the film with incident so that the audience could never relax and process the cinematic shortcomings. So more or less every moment has either fighting, people saying stupid things, the monster dragging people to their doom or spurts of picturesque photography in the Hong Kong section or vintage urban grime in the rest. The fighting isn't especially convincing (plenty of blows fall obviously wide plus some dodgy framing and people moving at unrealistic speeds), but it's a lot better than expected, with a cast that at least know how to move and a shooting style that lets you see whats going on. It helps that much of the fighting involves hero Luke, played by the awesomely named and almost as awesomely afroed War Hawk Tanzania. His character isn't as badass as his name but he has a solid presence and carries the film nicely, delivering his frequently hilarious jive dialogue with aplomb. In fact everyone gives it their all, even extras like a nasty old bag lady, crazy street preacher or clueless cop. Sadly the monster scenes are quite weak and there are only a couple of gore shots, also the dodgy quality of current available prints renders the subway scenes too dark. The climax is too abrupt as well, though when ultimately revealed the monster is kinda cool in a cheap-jack kinda way. Altogether its a likable rather than good film and a bit tricky to fully appreciate until a spruced up DVD appears, but trash junkies could do far worse with 80 minutes of their time. Slightly generous 6/10 from me...",1
8,"Some demon travels from China to New York City to get an ancient Chinese amulet from some white guy who thinks he is a black guy and a kung fu soul brutha must stop it. Now I haven't seen too many blaxploitation movies but this has to be the most incompetently made blaxploitation movie ever. The dialogue is just idiotic to a tee. The editing is sloppier than a cesspool particularly the last scene when this guy was making a joke and the credits just suddenly cut him off as if to say ""I just don't care anymore"". The fight choreography was just the worst as you can clearly see that these guys were not making contact at all and missing each other by two feet. And I don't get why a Chinese guy would fight a soul brutha with a samurai sword bare handed. Ugh! The acting was horrendous..... I can go all day. This is the best ####ing movie ever I don't care what you think. Aargh! Yes, despite the trashy wacky incomprehensible crap and the aforementioned flaws, Devil's Express entertainment value is enormous.",1
4,"From a time when every white kid squinted their eyes, made dying cat howls and broke their legs jumping into the garage wall trying to be Bruce Lee comes a Z-grade blaxploitation zombie kung fu masterpiece that tries - oh, how it tries - to cover all bases, but all it really does is redefine the term ""black action"". Set mainly in a New York subway, it's so black you can hardly see any action. Can you dig it? Warhawk Tanzania plays kung fu master Luke Curtis, known by his pupils as See-Fu. On a meditation retreat to China, his star pupil Rodan (as in the giant Japanese pterodactyl) unwittingly picks up a silver medallion from the tomb of an ancient demon. Being the Seventies, ugly jewelry is considered the height of fashion, and they return to New York. The demon, meanwhile, bursts out of his tomb, jumps on the first ship to Harlem, possesses a brother-man, and wanders comically through the subway with huge white eyes painted onto his lids with liquid paper, looking for souls to feed on. The trail of murders sparks a gang war between local kung-fu-kicking triads the Red Dragons and ghetto gang the Black Spades (I kid you not). When Rodan has his necklace (and his head) torn off, Warhawk finally has a moment of clarity - see, the meditation finally pays off - and he bravely heads into the subway for a brother-to-brother showdown.Devil's Express was Warhawk's second and final film after Force Four (aka Black Force, 1975). Warhawk spends most of his screen time running down ""honkies"" and proving he's a Man of the People - saying no to drugs, giving street kids a hi-five, and eating Chinese takeout - with chopsticks - with his wooooman. What he can't do, and it's apparent from the start, is fight for shinola; as a bottom-shelf Jim Kelly, he's all attitude with no acting OR fighting chops to back it up. His punches land six inches from their intended destinations, all with the most inappropriate sound effects. As a distraction to how bad his fighting is, he steps on a Chinese kid's throat and bursts a blood vessel. Dramatic? No. Ludicrous? Of course. And that's the charm of a Warhawk Tanzania film. By the way - ever seen a Chinese kid with an afro? For a no-name cast, there's a surprise sacrilicious street-side ranting by New York eccentric Brother Theodore: ""Moses is dead, Mohammed is dead, Buddha is dead... and I'm not feeling so hot myself."" Bad acting, ham-fisted fighting and peppered with the most gut-wrenchingly exaggerated jive (""I know where you're coming from, See-Fu. I can DIG it!""), Devil's Express is a film that succeeds in making Huggy Bear look like Humphrey B. Bear. Can YOU dig it?",-1
3,"This seems like footage from what was 2 bad films cut together badly to make an even worst film. Warning for those who were peaked by the synopsis, 99% of the movie is not about the demon.",-1
7,"OK. I wasn't expecting much of this film on Amazon, but it was a short blacksploitation/chop-socky film with a lead called Warhawk Tanzania.
Let's start with him. 70s machismo kung fu artist, with almost no acting ability, bizarre novelty fight stances, but full of 'I'm going to be the next Jim Kelly' enthusiasm. He isn't. He's actually quite terrible.
His Jersey Hispanic sidekick is even worse, at both the acting and fighting. the support actors were similarly poor, with the bizarre exception of the 'educated' jokey detective drafted in to help solve the case. He just seemed to be in the wrong film entirely.
As expected, the story moves along in a disjointed fashion. Full of poorly shot fight scenes, where you clearly see that the kicks and punches are missing, but somehow the recipient lurches back in agony. Some of the subway/monster scenes have a genuinely eerie 70s feel, and in parts, the film is not bad. The DP tries some effects in part- slomo/monochrome, etc.
I won't spoil the plot, because actually that doesn't matter. Made in a time when New York was genuinely a dangerous place, people wore flares, and production values were less important than the 'vibe'. I happily watched this to the end just to ensure that Warhawk put the fiend 'in the pocket'.
If you can wade through the clichés and cheesiness, this is worth a view, if only for the terrible fashion, grubby New York outlook, 70s jazz-hipster dialogue and an actor inspired by decolonisation to change his name so spectacularly.
Worth a view. They don't make 'em like this anymore!",1
6,"One reviewer described this as like ""Black Belt Jones vs. The Galaxy Invader,"" but that only scratches the surface. Exhumed Films calls it ""a Blaxploitation/Horror/Kung-Fu absurdist masterpiece,"" which they very correctly note ""could only exist in the exploitation heyday of the 1970s."" This gets a bit closer. You're really getting 3 or 4 different movies in one here. Possibly my favorite plot of all-time: a soul-brother karate instructor travels to Hong Kong to learn and master his art, where his buddy and protégé steals an ancient amulet which (unbeknownst to him) has the power to control a demon. The demon follows them home to NYC where it hides in the subway and begins killing innocent (and not-so-innocent) bystanders. Oh, and by the way? The amulet-stealing buddy is also a drug dealer with an ongoing vendetta against the local Chinese crime gang. That's at least 2 movies right there. The film now shifts gears to another buddy of the karate instructor, who is a cop investigating the subway killings. This portion of the film now plays like a supernatural/creature hunter/police procedural/X-Files kinda thing. Again, this could be a movie in its own right. Everything comes to a head when the black kung-fu-ers and the Chinese gang realize it might not just be their street fights that's killing off their members, and that maybe the cops are on to something when they say something is lurking in the subway, waiting to mutilate its next victim. This all ends with what is the trippiest final fight sequence since Zardoz. I would not have believed such a movie could exist had I not seen it. I *have* seen it. You should too.",1
7,"This is the second-to-shortest of the half a dozen featurettes on the DVD of The Bourne Ultimatum, and thus part of the ""explosive bonus content"" that the back of the cover lures you into the very worthwhile purchase(if you like the film and/or the series). It consists of behind-the-scenes footage, interviews with cast and crew alike and a couple of clips of the movie(if you haven't already seen it, you should not watch this, even though it doesn't hold as many spoilers as some of these documentaries), that particular scene. In five minutes, you see material of the rehearsals and practicing that went into the awesome and unforgettable fight, and they get into how they made it safe for them, with the props and such. It's all well-edited, with everything kept concise and brief. This has some really cool martial arts, shown and talked about. It's well-paced and things are explained nicely. And you get to see Damon and Ansah each do an Arnie impression lasting all of a few seconds, if that makes any difference to your decision on whether or not to pursue this. I recommend this to anyone who enjoyed that part of the flick. 7/10",1
7,"We start of in Marocco on 'Desh's day off'. This is of course Jason Bourne's fittest adversary yet as played by Joey Ansah, seen here practicing Capoeira moves and other martial arts tricks on the beach. From there we move over to Pinewood studios, where the actual four piece fight scene was photographed over the course of two and a half exhausting days.As always, fight choreographer Jeff Imada came up with some intriguing common house hold objects for the two top agents to grab and beat each other up with. Naturally Bourne, being the good guy putting the emphasize on common while Desh prefers to go for dangerous. First Jason hits Desh in the Adam's apple with a hard bound cookbook while Desh swings back at him with an ornate pedestal ashtray. As the fight moves into the bathroom, Desh tries to cut Bourne with a straight razor, Jason protects himself with a towel. Prop man (sorry, Breakaway and Safety prop man) Thomas Jones shatters the illusion by showing the world that these potential murder weapons are specially prepared soft replicas.Matt Damon also pipes in, telling the camera that he studies balance and learns it like a dance rather than try to compete with the actual martial artists. After all, his character is basically fighting a younger, leaner, more improved version of himself (according to Imada). Still, at the the end of the day just like all the other guys at the gym, Mattie and Joey can't resist doing a little Hanz & Franz impersonation of Gov. Arnie. Boys will be boys, after all.7 out of 10",1
9,"In my opinion, Nikki DeLoach is Hallmark's best actor. Her movies aren't the fluffy ones that are stereotypical romance movies.This movie has echoes of other movies. A beloved deceased relative leaves evidence behind of a first love before marrying the spouse that all the family knew. There's a beloved family store. This one isn't going bankrupt, but it's gotten disorganized. Widowed mom meets someone. The leading lady has a boyfriend and there was an aborted proposal at the beginning. Then back at her hometown she runs into an old flame that didn't end well when they were young.But there's more to this movie. The title refers to Clara's expressed wish for 5 more minutes with her late Grandfather. That theme isn't a casual one. But saying more is definite spoilers.There is a major twist with subtle clues foreshadowing it. I was very lucky to spot the clues and interpret them from the first.Very nice ending. Sappy, but I love sappy.",1
8,"I approached this one with a lot of misgiving. I mean, a story based on a country song? By Scotty McCreery? But to my surprise, it was pretty good. Nikki Deloach, who is good as always, is a dedicated Art teacher who is losing her job and is having doubts about her relationship with her boyfriend. She wishes she could have just five more minutes with her beloved late Grandpa who always gave her great advice.When she goes home to celebrate Christmas(?) Thanksgiving (?) I don't remember, she finds a journal written by Grandpa when he was a young man detailing his first lost love. She gets together with an old ex-boyfriend, and they decide to try to find her. Or was that another movie, Christmas Together with You? They're already starting to run together a bit. At the same time, a young man shows up for a job at her store because he said her grandpa was going to hire him. He turns out to be a wonder and is the best employee ever. It's pretty clear from the get-go that something spooky is going on. There are lots of clues, which I'll keep to myself.Sherry Miller plays Bonnie, Clara's mom, who lost her husband about a year ago. She looks great. I always think of the actress with fondness because she was in one of my favorite TV romcoms, This Matter of Marriage, back in the late '90s when she was a young whippersnapper. Highly recommend. She has her own romance along with her daughter finding love with her ex, Logan, and dumping her current beau. I liked that Bonnie did not approve of the ex, who behaved badly dumping Clara when they were teens, and kept giving him the stink-eye. She came around though.There were a couple of things I did not like. Despite both Clara and Logan being established as Hallmark paragons of niceness, they both behaved badly. Logan kept putting the moves on Clara even after she said she had a boyfriend. And Clara totally dumped Logan and canceled an invitation for the family-less guy to spend Thanksgiving (?) Christmas (?) with her family just because he was called back to active duty. This was really low behavior and hardly patriotic or compassionate. Also contrary to the Hallmark ethos. The third thing I didn't like was the under-use of Leanne Lapp who played Clara's sister and a favorite of mine.",1
6,"Five more minutes gets right to the heart of the matter...time with loved ones is precious and so often people are wishing for just five more minutes when they should be living like these are their last minutes , so their loved ones always know how they feel.Clara goes home for Christmas to help her mother at the bakery her recently deceased grandfather owned and ran, for Christmas. While home she wishes she had just five more minutes with her grandfather, reconnects with her adventurous first love, and finds out about her grandfather's first love through his journal.Overall message of this film is great and the country song about five-more minutes make this a much watch holiday film.",1
10,"The best Hallmark Christmas movie of 2021. What a lovely, inspirational story. Loved the twist at the end. I guess my only question is - had none of them seen pictures of grampa when he was young? Maybe not - and that might explain why her mom never had an encounter with Jay. Still - even with the question, the end had me in tears. Loved it ... will watch this one over and over.",1
5,"Story isn't bad but there are so many issues with the geography, military accuracy, etc. I was stationed at Ft. Bragg for nine years and it never snowed once. The film shows deep snow everywhere. If Fayetteville gets 1/4 inch of snow (rarely happens), the whole town shuts down. Fayetteville is not a quaint little village. It is a sprawling city with a metro population of about 600,000 people. Also, one of the characters references that her husband will be stationed at Ft. Bragg for two years. Military orders don't dictate how long you will be at a duty station unless it's for training and your MOS isn't used at the training station which would require a transfer after training. There is no such airport as Durham International. Fayetteville Regional Airport has daily flights with major airlines American and Delta Airlines. I've never heard of anybody flying into RDU (Raleigh-Durham Intl.) and driving the rest of the way.",-1
4,"I expect holiday movies to be positive and funny, this one dwells on the past and losses. I liked Nikki DeLoach, Sherry Miller and the rest of the cast. It was easy to figure who Alex was at the beginning of the movie. I found the movie depressing, Hallmark has made much better ones. Avoid if possible.",-1
10,"Hallmark comes through with a beautifully written movie! I've been a fan of DHJ ever since I saw him in Dear Santa and I enjoy ND as well. Her acting is refreshingly authentic, she was so believable in this role. The movie reminds us just how precious life is and how truly wonderful it is to experience a deeply profound love. Spend quality time with family and friends, cherish those who are nearest and dearest to your heart! Well done to the cast and crew and Scotty McCreery's ""Five More Minutes""",1
10,"This was Hallmark at its most wonderful. I was completely drawn in and thoroughly engaged the whole time. The story was beautiful and the cast was absolutely perfect. Not one character was miscast or acted poorly. Nikki DeLoach and David Haydn-Jones were perfect and showed exactly why they're beloved staples in Hallmark movies.I had the best time watching this movie. To be honest, there's so much more I could say but this would be one of the longest reviews on IMDb. So, I'll end with this: When a movie is over and you find yourself sitting there, not moving, just to take it all in and relate the message to your own life... that's pretty meaningful. 10+ Stars all season long and for years to come!",1
8,"There is something that I find hard to digest in a majority of TV romantic movies. How can the heroine, supposedly intelligent, kindhearted and dependable, drop her present love interest and immediately commit to a new, ""the one"" eternal love, generally with no apparent interior conflict. This is my gripe with this and so many other films. Otherwise, the story is gentle, heart-warming and inventive. Nikki Deloach is at her usual best and the rest of the cast delivers. It is a story rich with sentiments and the little magic we expect at the time when is allowed to be kids-at-heart, again. May be, Hallmark has not completely lost the touch, as I feared.",1
10,I totally enjoyed the movie. The story line was fantastic and it did not give anything away like in most Hallmark movies. I can totally feel her emotions and cried right along with her. Thanks Hallmark for a fantastic holiday movie.,1
7,"Pixar Studios has won a lot of Oscars over the years--many of them for Best Animated Short. ""LOU"" is their latest nomination and is a very pleasant little film. However, it's NOT among the studio's best shorts and is relatively pedestrian....but I still think it will win this year...mostly because the other nominees are a very weak bunch. As I noticed one other reviewer say in their summary, ""Yet another win for Pixar animation""!
The film is hard to describe. It's set on a playground at a school and somehow a pile of lost and found objects have become sentient and take on a weird form. Later, they teach a bully a lesson.The film, start to finish, looks great. This is no surprise at all as the best animated films in the world are coming from Pixar and Disney Studios. While I liked it and respect the quality of the production, it also seemed very safe and not particularly inspiring or out of the ordinary.",1
9,"Being a big fan of Pixar since forever, both their feature films and short films, of course expectations for 'LOU' were high. Luckily, those high expectations were not just met, in some ways they were exceeded.'LOU' is not quite among Pixar's best short films like 'Presto', 'One Man Band', 'Knick Knack', 'Piper' and 'Geri's Game'. However, it is one of the biggest examples of the short film being much better than the feature film. Didn't care for 'Cars 3', finding that despite the great animation that it never really got into gear and was highly suggestive of the 'Cars' franchise running out of gas, but loved 'LOU' and that it alone is worth the admission. The premise could have been potentially goofy, but was a long way from that. It's not exactly unique but is incredibly well handled that that is insignificant.The animation is fantastic, one of Pixar's best-looking later short films and perhaps overall, some of its fluidity, colour and detail being among Pixar's overall best perhaps. Which is huge praise, considering that even in their lesser efforts like 'The Good Dinosaur' and 'Cars 2 and 3' for features and 'Mater and the Gaslight' and 'Lava' for shorts (this said, as blasphemous as this may sound, 'Cars 3' is the only one that didn't do much for me) the animation is always one of the best assets. The music score has whimsical energy and a suitably understated quality at points, not using a repetitive song to make an impression and is never ham-fisted or intrusive.What stood out about 'LOU' was its mood, how one really connects with it and how well it did with its idea. Story-wise it is slight and not much of one, but that didn't matter too much and the short duration flies by and makes one wish for more actually. Watching 'LOU' was such an uplifting and heartfelt experience for me, parts are amusing but not in an overt way and it is hard not to be touched too. The mix of gentle (and in other efforts of theirs riotous) humour and heart-wrenching pathos was always a strength with Pixar, 'LOU' is not an exception by any stretch of the imagination.It also has charm by the bucket-loads and it was incredibly cute without being too sickly or sugary. It even prompts some thought-provoking questions and thoughts. The characters are appealing and engage you, even the bully (which usually would be an impossible feat).Overall, captivating and 7 short minutes of joy and beauty. 9/10 Bethany Cox",1
6,"LOU is an unseen creature made out of stuff from the LOst and foUnd box in the schoolyard. It cleans up after the kids while they are in class. It is dismayed at J.J. bullying the other kids. It battles J.J. to return stuff stolen from the other children.This is a Pixar short that comes with the movie Cars 3. It's perfectly fine family viewing especially for the kids. In a way, it fits well with Cars 3 which is also perfectly fine. The creature design of random objects is a little usual. It is able to be cute without being creepy. This is perfectly fine.",1
6,"Oh yes I did. ""LOU"" is a 7-minute animated short film from this year and it is certainly already now among the most seen and most successful short films of 2017. This has to do with the fact that it is another collaboration between Disney and Pixar and as such a force to be reckoned with when it comes to the Best Animated Short Film category at the Oscars 2018. The writer and director is Dave Mullins and he has worked in the animation department of quite a few Pixar films already, but this here is the moment of truth for him as the man in charge. Voice actor Jack Bright is also not new to the Pixar universe. Now the story here takes place at a school yard and we have the kids having fun until they are disturbed by a bully. The title character though is once again for Pixar not human, but the lost and found boy standing nearby that seems to possess some kind of spirit or artificial intelligence inside as the contents in there keep becoming all kinds of creatures in leading the bully kid back to the path of kindness. The inclusion of his favorite stuffed animal when he was way younger is where Pixar delivers emotionally as always, even if it may go a bit over the top eventually with the idea of self-sacrifice for the good cause. And the first 2-3 minutes also did not impress me at all. But luckily, there is a great deal of improvement in the second half of this little movie. And finally, yes it is Disney and Pixar and yes we sure expect the animation and character design to be really as good as it gets, but we should still not take it for granted that it is in fact on a very high level visually again. Overall, this should be a surefire for an Oscar nomination, but I am not entirely sold on it to win. Same for me personally. I think it will end up on my list of favorite animated short films from 2017, but I cannot really see it reaching the top spot, maybe not even the podium. But of course, it is definitely worth checking out if you love (modern) animation. I give it a thumbs-up.",1
5,"LOU is a Lost & Found box in a school filled with associated items that have been discarded.As the school bully plays pranks and takes away other kids toys and football etc. The items in the box get together to teach the bully a lesson by trying to take away its backpack.I am not sure the story works and it was underwhelming. If the items in the box belonged to other kids, why did they not go there in the first place?The animation is frenetic and well detailed but not the strongest of the Pixar shorts..",-1
8,"The point of the Academy Award-nominated ""Lou"" seems to be that we all have good in our hearts, we sometimes just need motivation to find it. I do agree that motivation and reminding someone of goodness works better than punishment. Not any kind of masterpiece, but worth seeing.",1
8,"This Disney-Pixar short was shown before Cars 3. During recess, a bully takes all the kids' toys or other of their valuables and puts them in a box. A flashback is provided that explains some of his behavior... I'll stop there and just say there's some amusing stuff concerning a creature that can only exist in an animated cartoon but it's believable enough to suspend logical thought and it contributed enormously to my enjoyment of this short. Really, all I'll say now is I recommend LOU.",1
9,""" . . . could be persuaded to have a change-of-heart, and totally Reform?"" LOU opens with the proverbial playground tyrant stealing other kids' stuff on his elementary school playground, and otherwise tormenting them, with NO adult supervision in sight. It is unlikely, of course, that any perceptive U.S. Citizen will be able to watch these Deplorable outrages without being immediately put in mind of Red Commie KGB Chief Vlad ""The Mad Russian"" Putin and his Puppet, Rump. Fortunately for the children at this particular location, Putin's U.S. Secretary of Miseducation--Billionaire Fat Cat Betsey ""Amway Calling"" DeVos--has not yet turned it into one of her For-Profit Charter Brainwashing Shacks (which she has used to destroy the Detroit School System, so that virtually no polling place workers will have the skills to tally legal votes in that True Blue Loyal Union Label Stronghold in coming years). A magic Lost and Found Box gives LOU his comeuppance as this animated short concludes. Hopefully, Putin and Rump will open a similarly benign Pandora's Box BEFORE the outbreak of Armageddon.",1
8,"'LOU': Four Stars (Out of Five) A 6-minute Pixar animated short film, which plays before 'CARS 3' in theaters, about a monster that lives inside a lost-and-found box. The short was written and directed by debut filmmaker Dave Mullins; a veteran animator who's previously worked on multiple feature Pixar films (including 'CARS' and 'CARS 2'). The short, like everything from Pixar, is of course visually beautiful to watch, at all times. It's also funny, creative and it even has a great message about not bullying others (at the end). It has pretty much everything you've come to expect from a Pixar short film. This one isn't quite as emotional as my favorite Pixar shorts are though, even though it touches on a subject very close to me (bullying). Which I've had to deal with all of my life, including adulthood. Still it's always visually creative and amusing to watch. It's definitely entertaining too, for kids and adults, and it does have a very positive message. The short is yet another win for Pixar animation.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/K3Maw4akm_o",1
9,"This was the short film released before the screening of ""Cars 3"". It really is a very strange short film as it features a lost and found box and a creature that lives within it. What I don't understand is what this creature even is. I mean, it seems to just be a random combination of lost items. At the end however, we see all the parts of the creature being played with. So was it some single entity possessing these parts? It was so strange. Still, this was a great cartoon. ""Cars 3"" was a decent movie, but this little cartoon is better.I really appreciate how unique the idea is. It makes you think about what goes on in a lost and found box. This short features a bully who takes other kids' stuff because he misses his own toy that got taken from him. The lost and found things then come alive and convince him to return them. Okay, it's kind of a goofy premise, but the execution is great. We get some very creative visuals with the lost and found creature and everything works out for all the kids in the end. There's no dialogue which further demonstrates how visually nice it is. It's quite strange, but it's still a very entertaining little short. ***1/2",1
5,"LOU is a mediocre short film with a lackluster plot that does not succeed in getting its point across. There is, of course, no denying that the animation itself is stellar, the world is captured beautifully and the way in which the title character himself is rendered is very effective, with each and every piece of the character making movements and sounds that is realistic. As far as Pixar short goes, it failed to intrigue me in any way. The studio has done breath taking work in the past several years with their short films, and it is no surprise that many of them have taken away Academy Awards. They have the power to make their audience feel in the space of less than ten minutes, LOU does not manage to be anyway as near in terms of effectiveness.The film also fails to get its message across, it was very clear that it was trying to capture something to us, but not clear what that something was. When the credits began to roll, I was underwhelmed that I did not feel anything as a result of how vague it all was.A forgettable endeavour. Some Pixar fans may still love it, but LOU never managed to grab me. The items of a lost and found box come to life to teach a troublesome student a lesson.",-1
7,This is a funny short and the animation is some of the zaniest that Pixar has done. But the redemption of the bully is unearned because it is ultimately transactional. It is very funny and enjoyable but it is missing the depth of other Pixar works.,1

9,"One boy was so selfish and greedy. He wants to get everything and he took many goods from box of Lost and found.But one day he learned to share things with people so he gave back goods to other students. This movie teaches us the importance of sharing things with people and that made people happy.I love this movie.Congrats to Pixer, one more time.",1
8,"It feels good to give back. This would be the message of this lovely short. You see, in life not everything is about us. It's also about others and the way we can enjoy this movie called life together, in peace and harmony. The world would change tremendously if we could change behaviours from time to time.",1
6,"LOU is a great example of a great idea not given enough room to breathe. LOU is about the Lost and Found bin at a school or daycare that is somehow sentient, with all the items inside the bin forming a its own mismatched being, One day, LOU sees a bully on the playground taking things from other kids, and in retaliation steals back the kids lost toys through an adorable slapstick-filled chase scene, and barters with the kid to give back all the items that have been put in the lost and found over time, in exchange for the bully's lost stuffed puppy. As more and more items are given back, LOU disappears, as there's nothing left in the lost and found for him to inhabit, and the kid learns a lesson about being nice. It's perfectly fine and a tad sad, but it's not doing anything that kids animation hasn't done before, which is what holds it back, and also is completely ripped apart by the simple question ""why did one kid have to return everything, why didn't the kids just get their lost toys themselves""? However, the core idea of this short, the idea of a Lost and Found come to life, has a lot of potential and is representative of the creativity Pixar is known for. Definitely a cute short, just nothing super special. 6.5/10",1

10,"As far as Pixar short films go, ""LOU"" was a gem as a family treat. As a Pixar shorts lover, I was a tyke after the early Pixar shorts came into the world. Really gave me the steadiest interest of Disney/Pixar films. I hope you would get a chance to shine the face of nature. Good thing, the studio worked really hard, along with making Cars 3, to put extreme amounts of effort, dedication, creativity, hard-work, perseverance, and colorful twist to this film. I'm sure Pixar done the best story-line like the previous shorts: ""Geri's Game,"" ""Piper,"" ""Tin Toy,"" ""For the Birds,"" and ""Luxo Jr.."" The animation itself never failed to disappoint any/every-one when it comes to films and previews. The direction and usage of few characters are well-done as well as the CGI. Some aspects carried more and more usual tone than ever. Comedy was used, and heartwarming emotions coming together to form a deep, deep lesson. Also, music carried over some strong, intense mood that suits the main point of the story. Even the conclusion produced more dynamic. ""LOU"" gives children a gift of joy, childhood, awesomeness, and positivity. Believe me, I'm a Pixar fan and seen many short films before feature films start and I noticed that Pixar has a strong work-ethic between commitments. It felt so dedicated to keep this tradition.Overall, this short film is a ""must"" for families and friends. I guarantee you will love this 6-7 minute event before seeing Cars 3 and getting a warm, fuzzy feeling on the way after you seen this. Grade: A+",1
7,"The bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in April 1995 is the worst act of domestic terrorism in American history; this documentary explores how a series of deadly encounters between American citizens and federal law enforcement - including the standoffs at Ruby Ridge and Waco - led to it.There is the matter of what this film is and what it isn't. If you want a broad view of Ruby Ridge, Waco and Oklahoma City in under two hours, this is the perfect primer or refresher. However, if you want to learn more, and were around in the 1990s, there is very little here you did not already read in the news at the time.I suppose if nothing else, this would be great for catching the younger generation up on what happened just twenty years ago, when ""terrorism"" and 9/11 were not yet synonymous.",1
8,"""Oklahoma City"" (2017 release; 115 min,) is a documentary about Timothy McVeigh's bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City, and the wider background as to what roe him to do this. As the movie opens, it is ""April 19, 1995, 9:02 am"" and we her voices at the Water Resource Board Meeting, when an enormous explosion takes place. We get various historical footage as to the damage caused by the bombing, as well as first account interviews of first aid helpers, survivors, and family members of the perished, We then go back in time to the early 1980s, in northern Idaho, where white supremacists are gathering steam. As this point we're 10 min, into the movie, but to tell you more of the story would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is, to say the least, a sobering documentary, Built in three major chapters, ""The Spark"" (referring to Ruby Ridge), ""The Flame"" (referring to Waco) and ""The Inferno"" (referring to Oklahoma City), the documentary makers examine how right wing white supremacists were able to build a small but fierce resistance cell that becomes convinced that the federal government is ""the enemy"". The link between Ruby Ridge/Oklahoma City on the one hand, and Waco on the other hand, is less obvious (the Waco incident does not involve white supremacists), but nevertheless essential for the McVeigh narrative, as the documentary makes clear. McVeigh's personal background, fairly well known at this point, is examined as well. In the end, the lasting images of this documentary remain those of the Oklahoma City bombing itself, to this date still the largest domestic terrorist attack in this country's history, and with it the resolve of the survivors and the family of the perished. ""Love is stronger than a terrorist attack"", comments a survivor who has forgiven McVeigh. Wow.This documentary played in a few theaters, but opened wide when it was shown on PBS' ""The American Experience"" last night. As it most often the case with programs on ""The American Experience"", the documentary was well researched, restrained and very sobering. A must-see for anyone interested in the history of this country.",1
9,"The half-witted anti-government philosophy responsible for the Oklahoma bombing took root in Ronald Reagan's famous quip that the government isn't the solution; it's the problem. Except when it is the solution, which it is for many things we now consider to be modern civilization. What the Hitler-lovers don't understand is that for a society to function, there must be compromise. Most people who live in big cities get this basic concept. Rural hillbillies just want everything their way and don't want to pay taxes.If you want to see a country without a government, I'd suggest you try Somalia. In theory, this is a libertarian's wet dream, except it isn't because Somalia is a hell-hole of anarchy. Of course, to flea-brains like Timothy McVeigh, their perfect world has individuals running all of the facets of modern life. What a ridiculous concept.McVeigh, like so many of his ilk, was mentally ill, obviously. He was also a freaking idiot with the IQ of a rodent, an animal to which he bore a remarkable resemblance. Medical examiners at his execution revealed that McVeigh's genitals were also rat-like and inadequate, even to facilitate congress with a small rodent. It's true, look it up! His whole movement is composed of inbred hicks, who when they pool all of their mental resources together still fail to conjugate verbs correctly in the only language that they speak, yet they call themselves the master race. How do they figure?The thing is, nobody like the cops, and the federal agencies (FBI, ATF et al) did some outrageous things, not just to the far-right freaks, but to lots of people with opposing views, but that's no excuse to go overboard. If they think that they can go toe-to-toe with these agencies, they are dumber than I ever thought they were.This is the central lie of the militia groups. You can suit up in G.I. Joe clothes and buy guns, but don't think that you could actually oppose a real, state-sponsored army, not even a little bit. As far as opposing the government, it is all we have as a people, the only thing we have purchase on in the quest for power. By limiting government, you are drastically limiting the power of the people and handing it over to the plutocrats, people like Trump and his backers (the people who control him, not those who voted for him).McVeigh opposes killing Iraqis but goes on to bomb a child care center. This is the sort of loony thinking of these violent groups. He was pulled over after the bombing because he didn't have a plate on the car he was driving? What a complete moron!I oppose the death penalty, even for a rat-face creep like McVeigh.",1
10,"Anytime you have Abrahamic separatists zealots fighting the government that's been infested with Leftists(Clintons & Branch Davidians going head to head)children will be caught in between & end up losing their lives in most cases.The children in Waco, nor the ones in Oklahoma City had to die. Thanks to unreasonable adults, both groups of children suffered & lost their lives. I was raised in an Abrahamic cult too, the J.W.'s(AKA Watchtower Bible & Tract Society). They always beat it into our brains as children ""that everything the government does is from Satan"" & ""this World is Satanic too"". And then my eldest sister's Leftist friends were always calling government folks ""an evil that needs to be reigned in, we need to be more like Cuba & share with one another & less like Capitalist scum"".See neither side is right to a thinker(both groups are fifth column scums IMO), I'm sure that the J.W.'s would never go all Waco on anyone(they're controlling, but very cowardly), but it did feel like we were in Jonestown being forced to be part of their operation, they're not benign at all!We were not allowed to have birthdays(I was made to sit in the hallway during birthday parties), holidays, participate in sports, no going to our proms or college either, also if you're in need of a blood transfusion forget about it, it's not allowed!We also get genitally mutilated as kids(I hated that the most) it's a complete case of evil being inflicted on innocent children. I also got my *** kicked as a kid when when I got caught talking on the phone with a cute girl that was a none J.W., a totally insane group of people IMO & experience.Now as an adult I want nothing to do with either group, I'm very middle of the road now & don't feel like losing my life over the aspirations of madmen. I only wish that whole situation didn't happen. Too many children get caught in the crossfire. Janet Reno, Bill Clinton & David Koresh were unable to see another's point of view.That's at the root of most tragedies today, inflexible people that have no place in a modern society. We can make a better future for all of us if we choose rational thought over anti-life dogma!",1
8,"I don't remember Oklahoma City, or Waco, or Ruby Ridge. These events, if they were in my young subconscious mind at all, were crowded out by 9/11, which happened when I was only ten years old. For a generation that has been inundated with images of terrorism, violence, and war, it's difficult to grasp just how explosive and unjust this event was, and how it shocked the nation to learn that born and bred Americans could be just as responsible for the destruction of the country's goodwill than foreign invaders.This film was directed by Emmy winning PBS documentarian Barak Goodman (Scottsboro: An American Tragedy). He begins the film's narrative at Oklahoma City, but then flashes back to the inception of the Aryan Nation in the mid-to-late eighties, and the ensuing terrorist institutions that created a platform for an army vet named Timothy McVeigh. Tracing this critical history of white held terrorism within the United States, we see the quick succession of violent white men who have taken arms against their government, and the almost unending paranoia that it created. People like David Koresh and Randy Weaver were the inspiration for an angry, xenophobic young man without many options and a plethora of military knowledge at his disposal. McVeigh chose the building because he wanted retribution for those who stood against the government and died because of it. In our current political climate terrorism is almost a give-in, an accepted cross to bear in our everyday lives. McVeigh was the first major figure in a long line of American born white men who have taken arms against their own citizenry (Eric Robert Rudolph, Dylann Roof, Wade Michael Page, and thirty-six others since Oklahoma City). This documentary not only sheds light on the horrific act of three disillusioned youths, but the greater trend of discontented, hate- filled teens who later become violent terrorists. These events are more common than ever, and it's not a problem that goes away with prayers and acceptance. It stops because we don't let it happen again. We protect our fellow man, our children, and those who don't have a voice. This film is illuminating in all the right ways, and emotionally devastating in a million others.",1
4,"Until they quoted the Southern Poverty Law Center the end. Next time, try quoting a legitimate organization. And, much of the footage was rehashed from other documentaries.",-1
3,"25 mins in and still no mention of the main perpetrator. Instead of summarising what angered and motivated Timothy McVeigh to commit the crimes the producers want to give you a detailed backstory. Sheesh! It's history now, just spit it out already😡",-1
1,"Relies 100% on biased information from the government. Glosses over and completely omits to tell the viewer the FBI and ATF was found to have acted illegally in both Ruby Ridge and Waco. This documentary uses who FBI and ATF agents that were proven to have lied about the fire in Waco by a federal court in 1999, as sources in interviews, and presents their legally proven false story as truth. This documentary is designed to misinform. It repeatedly shows white supremacist groups for no apparent reason, never drawing any link to the bombing, because there was none. The producers apparent goal in this piece of propaganda was to give unintelligent viewers the false impression that the Oklahoma City bombing, Ruby Ridge and Waco has something to do with racism, and that it is best we never doubt our masters, because only evil racists don't trust the federal government. Barf.",-1
1,"All this movie tries to do is humanize a terrorist. The documentary is well made and researched. It is effective in what is trying to do. The problems is that this documentary tries to make people understand Timothy McVeigh's point of view. We are exposed to different events that eventually led to the bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City and that is what's wrong with this film. It is not acceptable to humanize someone that hurt so many people.I understand that everyone has reasons to act the way they do and it is very interesting to know them, specially in relation to this event that marked the USA, but doing this is as preposterous as making a documentary of 9/11 and including a mini bio of Osama Bin Laden and events that pushed him to plan it. This documentary would never have been done if a person of color was the perpetrator. The director almost tries to excuse the actions of the terrorist because of their background.",-1
6,"McVeigh was quite eloquent as to why he did this. And the producers made it there mission to submit his personal testimony to confirm a story line, however there is ZERO proof that McVeigh had any motivation for that pathetic cause.
I lived through this. I'm from Junction City, KS. which happens to be adjacent to Ft. Riley. I sat in every seat and ordered from the counter that you see in the surveillance footage . The Army sent mixed race couples...black/white/korean/vietnamese = whomever to Ft Riley Kansas because that was the place they could all coexist with the least amount of resistance. Growing up, it was easy to understand how to respect all races. 
It's inconceivable that anyone that lived in that area during that time could possibly be racist.
Do not misinterpret this...I look forward to the day that the last white supremacist dies, however they are wrongfully accused in this documentary.
Why is it so hard to believe, as McVeigh has stated, that the American Government is solely to blame.
When the American Government disrespects life, in turn, an American citizen will also disrespect life.
LEAD BY EXAMPLE.
We've been through this in the 1950's, 60's, 70's, 80's, 90's, and 2 decades since. McVeigh is not the icon of a terrorist in the US but the refection of a terrorist state.
Yeah, that's right, Im talkin about patriotism....the good ole USA.",1
8,"When a short film is better than the main feature it accompanies. Kamandi delivers all the Easter eggs and service it possibly can. This feels like a post apocalyptic world right from the 1970's. The opening scene itself is a homage to the cover of issue one. Absolute spot on Jack Kirby likenesses. 18 minutes that flew by, is a good sign of some quality entertainment from D. C. it's a shame that this wasn't the main feature. Ending sets up a possible sequel which I am now wanting to see.",1
8,I bought justice society WW2 today on DVD and Blu-ray watched this on the Blu-ray and I got to say it's ok it's not bad and it's not good. I hope to see better ones in the near future.,1
10,"Kamandi is an unpopular character ,,, but Dc shows him in a great way.Loves to see that DC is introducing such characters in its Animated series.",1
7,"After watching The Navy Lark which for years was a popular British radio show about the crew of a minesweeper on peacetime duty I now know where a lot of the comedy and the general idea for McHale's Navy came from. The situations seemed remarkably close.Commander Cecil Parker has command of a minesweeper stationed upon a channel island of Boonsey which seems to have a mixed population of British and French. The mission is for the minesweeper to clear out all mines left from the late war, but that's been fulfilled a long time ago. But not according to Parker who sends in reports regularly about the work his crew is doing. Parker and the rest of the crew has grown to like it on the island and don't want to join the real Royal Navy any time soon.The Captain Binghamton of The Navy Lark is Nicholas Phipps who wants to close down the Boonsey Island operation, but not if Parker and his trusty crew can stop him.In the end through a series of misunderstandings the Navy believes that a revolution against British imperialism is taking place. What happens then is for you to see.What I can see is why The Navy Lark was such a popular radio show in the United Kingdom. And I think American viewers will see the parallels with McHale's Navy and respond favorably.",1
6,"All of the mines have long been cleared from the waters around the Channel Islands, so the Admiralty orders the crew of the sweeper Troutbridge paid off and the frigate decommissioned. That interferes with the idyllic existence of the crew, so they employ various maneuvers the frustrate orders...including inciting an independence movement.It's based on the immensely popular BBC Radio Service comedy of the same name, and stars such dependable comedy players as Cecil Parker, Ronald Shiner, Leslie Phillips, and Hattie Jacques. Surprisingly, for a show that depended so much on catchphrases, double entendre and shtick, the only performer reprising his role from radio is Leslie Phillips; given that Jon Pertwee, Ronnie Barker, and Dennis Price were in the Radio cast, this seems odd, but the show ran for fifteen seasons over eighteen years.The movie itself is a pleasant piece of nonsense, making fun of Navy politics and bureaucracy, offering many a chuckle along its length. It's no classic, but it's good fun.",1
6,"In one of the ""Carry On"" series, someone tells Sid James that the Arabs they are about to encounter are very intense. ""Well, the Arabs do everything in tents, don't they?"" The median measure of humor in ""The Navy Lark"" lingers around that neighborhood. Gordon Jackson shows up with a dozen rifles and asks the Chief Boatswain what he should do with them. ""Well, shove them in your arsenal, you idiot!"" But on the whole this is a more structured send up than most of the ""Carry On"" features -- less episodic and opportunistic, more of a beginning and an end.A British ""Inshore Minesweeping Unit"" has been forgotten by the Navy after World War II on the peaceful channel island of Boonsley and they've adapted to the circumstances. The military shell is maintained. The men still wear uniforms most of the time and the proper reports are filed, although the reports of hundreds of mines is exaggerated, since the only mine about is a defused one on the beach named Bessy that the children play on. The captain, Cecil Parker, spends his time fishing. His Number One is romancing the single Wren on the island. The Chief Boatswain runs a wine smuggling business on the beach -- and so on. No one wants to disrupt the tranquility of Boonsley. Except some suspicious authorities from the upper echelon.I found it much funnier than the ""Carry On"" series. Not to worry, though. There's little in the way of subtlety here. It doesn't aim for the dazzling heights of the best of the Ealing comedies. I'll give one comparative example of the difference.Parker and his crew take an stern, nosy inspector from Portsmouth on a mine sweeping mission to convince him that the unit is still functioning and necessary. Since it's assumed that no German mines are around, old Bessy has been refloated. Mistakenly the boat encounters a real mine and, thinking it's Bessy, the crew haul it aboard and treat it in a cavalier fashion, crawling all over it, banging it with wrenches, while the inspector quails. ""Careful there, men,"" the unwitting Parker orders with faux authority -- and the live mine drops with a clank on the deck.In ""The Man in the White Suit,"" an inventor has been doing experiments in a gallon-sized retort on a desk. The dozen experiments have all exploded so far, wrecking half the factory. Still another attempt, and the inventor presses the plunger on the detonator from behind a wall of sandbags. Cut to the retort, filled with a bubbling fluid that suddenly stops making noise and turns white -- finally, a success. The camera dollies back to show Cecil Parker bending over the device, looking quizzically at the transformation.Two potentially disastrous situations, both involving Cecil Parker. One is funny, the other hilarious.In a way it's unfair to compare the two because at their peak the Ealing comedies were peerless, among the funniest ever made, or so it seems to me. ""The Navy Lark"" isn't helped by a frantic musical score that does its best to persuade us to laugh. But, except for the overdone climactic battle for Boonsley's home rule, it is an amusing tale and it takes some marvelous pokes at the military bureaucracy. The first couple of minutes might lead you to suspect one silly incident after another, but the film soon grounds itself in a more familiar reality.You'll probably enjoy it.",1
7,"This was originally intended as a bit of Christmas entertainment in 1959 and it is quite successful. Cecil Parker is the wily (""Cdr. Stanton"") and his adjutant, the typically philandering Leslie Phillips (""Lt. Pouter"") are based on the island of ""Boonzey"" where they are supposed to be regularly sweeping the shipping lanes for mines... except, well they spend most of their time fishing, swimming and engaging in a little bootlegging with nearby France. Nicholas Phipps is the career-minded Captain ""Povey"" who is charged with finding and shutting down superfluous naval assets and this looks like a prime candidate, What he hasn't reckoned with is their desire to be left in peace - and the extent to which they will use their wit, wisdom and deviousness to achieve their goal... It's got just about everything from fake mines; an enigmatic ""Pullson's Fulminator Mk.3 "" to yellow fever and outright revolution that ends up involving the upper echelons of the Admiralty and the Parliaments on both sides of the Channel. Parker, Ronald Shiner and Phillips are on good form, the script from Lawrie Wyman is quickly paced and frequently witty and for the most part it is quite an amiable comedy. It is stretched too thin, though - but it's full of jolly characters and I did enjoy it...!",1
5,"As another reviewer noted, the American TV sitcom, ""McHale's Navy"" of 1962-66 comes to mind from the very start of this film. No doubt the makers of McHale got their ideas from this British farce. There are some major plot differences, of course. McHale took place during World War II, and the combat reputation of his crew was tops. It's between their combat forays that McHale and company got into all kinds of shenanigans. ""The Navy Lark"" takes place five years after the war, and the efficiency of this lot in mine-sweeping is very questionable.Lark itself is a film adaptation of a popular BBC radio sitcom of the same title that began earlier that year - on March 29, 1959. Only it deviated considerably from the radio show where the crew operated a frigate named HMS Troutbridge. Here, Commander Stanton, played by Cecil Parker, commands the mine-sweeper, HMS Compton. It operates off the fictional island of Boonzey which is located ""55 ½ miles"" out of Portsmouth, according to the film introduction.That would put the island just about in the middle of the English Channel from Portsmouth to Le Havre. In the five years since the war, the Compton has found and disarmed a single mine. They refer to it as ""Bessy,"" and it now sits on the local town's beach where it is painted to support the ""Boonzey Lifeboat Fund - Give Generously.""""The Navy Lark"" is an outlandish farce and slight satire of the higher echelons of the Royal Navy. Clever, witty or funny lines are not the staple here. Rather, it's situations, conditions and some antics that provide the smiles and occasional laughs. The very funniest thing in the film is the island's warning siren. It never gets to a high pitch but sounds like an old car trying to start when the engine won't turn over. Only the chugs sound more like dying coughs.All of the cast are okay. The best and funniest are Parker as Commander Stanton and Ronald Shiner as Chief Petty Officer Banyard. Elvi Hale is good as the leading WREN, Heather; and Leslie Phillips is all humorous nonsense as Lt. Pouter. The only other familiar cast member to most movie buffs will be Gordon Jackson as Seaman Johnson.From online sources I've read, it seems that this film was a box office flop. Perhaps the screenplay changes to visuals from sound lost much of the humor in the minds of viewers and listeners of the BBC radio program. The ""McHale's Navy"" imitation was a resounding TV success in the U.S. in the early 1960s.It's hard to say how many people in the 21st century might enjoy this film. As an old Army veteran, I enjoy most comedies set in or around the military. But this one doesn't rate anywhere near the very good ones in that genre. It's a coin toss as to who might find this movie worthwhile.Here are the best two of the few comical lines in the film.CPO Banyard, ""Well, whatever it is that's upset you, sir, I've got three witnesses to prove that I wasn't anywhere near what it was when whatever it was happened, sir.""WREN Heather, ""I'll teach you to go sneaking up on people with your snorkel.""",-1
5,"Before TV spin offs there came radio spin offs such as Life With The Lyons,The Grove family and 20Questions Murder Mystery.In those films the original radio cast was used but not here.Only Leslie Phillips survives,presumably because he was established as a film actor.As to the replacements i would have preferred to see Jon Pertwee and Ronnie Barker reprise their roles.However the addition of Cecil Parker is quite inspired as he was a truly great comedy actor in his later years.The film is quite funny up to the half way point but then sags with the rather unfunny revolution.Also i think that Ronnie Shiner was clearly an unfortunate choice for the CPO.He looks very aged and not really up to it.",-1
9,"Here is another great old British comedy from the 1950s about life in the British Navy just after WWII. I believe this film is up there with the Carry on films and ""Doctor"" series, indeed sharing some of the same cast such as Hattie Jacques, Cecil parker, Nicholas Phipps and Leslie Phillips. The Navy Lark should be given the respect of a release on DVD soon.I remember watching the movie about ten years ago on TV and thoroughly enjoying it at the time. Its a great put your feet up, disengage brain and enjoy experience.If you are a fan of Carry on you will also be a fan of the Navy Lark",1
8,"""Broken Saber"" may not be easily available nowadays (the entire series BRANDED issued on DVD in 2005), but the original 3-part episode ""The Mission"" certainly is. This was Chuck Connors' follow up to the highly successful THE RIFLEMAN, but only lasted two seasons due to the star's refusal to cozy up to the sponsors. The abbreviated first season of 16 episodes was in black and white, except for this one, shot in color in anticipation of feature release overseas, supposedly adding 20 minutes of new footage shot exclusively for this version only (which I have not seen). Connors' character Jason McCord was the lone survivor of an army battle with renegade Indians at Bitter Creek, where his supervisor had lost his mental acuity, a fact that McCord knows yet keeps to himself out of respect to the general's memory and his efforts to keep peace with the Apaches. Drummed out of the service for desertion, McCord is unjustly branded a coward, unwilling to clear his name yet not backing down from a fight. This 3-part storyline sees him called into service by President Ulysses Grant (William Bryant), on a secret mission to infiltrate a band of marauders working our Southern borders, retreating to safety in Mexico after conducting each outpost raid. John Carradine makes a brief appearance as Jason's grandfather Joshua McCord, one of the few who know the whole truth but aren't talking (a total of five episodes during its two season run). Among the guest stars who stand out are Macdonald Carey, Cesar Romero, Wendell Corey, Rochelle Hudson, and an especially animated Peter Breck, soon to star in THE BIG VALLEY. As a 3-part episode in color it works extremely well, ratcheting up suspense with each chapter, concluding with a delicious twist that proves more than satisfying; I can only wonder what additions were made to bolster this feature.",1
9,"This film should be widely released. I saw it tonight at the Salem Film Festival in Oregon and thought of it as one of the most original and beautiful films that has come out in the past several years. It has the feel to it of Italian films of the 1940s-60s, which is what the filmmakers were going for. It's an independent film, and sometimes it shows by seeming slightly amateur in its editing and making, though not much - for the most part, it is a very professional film. The scenes that are not there to move the plot along always have something that keeps it interesting, such as a recurring joke or a quirky interlude. I hope this film gets the recognition it deserves.",1
9,"""The Eternal City"" is a quality of film that is hard to properly communicate. With simply beautiful black and white photography and a wonderful soundtrack that scores the film far beyond simple background music, the film is a love story of romance, brotherhood, passion, betrayal, and obsession amongst its characters' various relationships, each of which helps to touch on the filmmakers' obvious love for the location of their city, the eternal city of Rome. Although certainly populated with enjoyable performances, I mostly enjoyed the style and structure of the film, which shows subtly enough, through neither theft nor obvious homage, the filmmakers' love not only for the city of Rome, but its history of fine cinema as well.Certainly a promising start for filmmakers I hope to see more from in the future.",1
8,"Sweet, charming, funny, and poignant - The Eternal City is great film with characters who really feel alive. I highly recommend this film for its nostalgic qualities and beautiful black and white photography. I had the chance to see The Eternal City on the big screen at the Cinequest film festival and it was one of the best Cinequest had to offer. Also worth mentioning are the locations in this film. Part of telling a good story revolves around creating mood, and The Eternal City succeeds in this regard because of its locations and production design. I'm not sure where or when this film will be playing next, but definitely keep your eyes open.",1
10,"I recently screened The Eternal City @ the Starz Denver Film Festival. After missing the first sold out screening I knew I had to try and make it to the second. I couldn't ignore all the buzz going around about the film, which left me standing in a pretty long RUSH line both times I went to see it.The film was most impressive with grand production values and impeccable casting. I felt the story was well executed and completely believable. I recommend this film to anyone who has always wanted to visit Rome but still hasn't had the chance. I spent the entire time laughing and trying to decipher which scenes were rehearsed and which were done on the spot as the whole movie appeared to be genuine.I wish the filmmakers all the best and luck for the future. They have a great property on their hands.",1
9,"I saw ETERNAL CITY on the big screen at Cinequest in San Jose.I left the theater with a sense of delight. What i loved about it was the anachronistic quality of the film-making that borrowed from tradition (Italian mostly) but felt completely fresh.It has, as the title suggests, a timeless quality. It is sweet (but not saccharine). The performances are charming. The sumptuous black and white cinematography is beautifully realized.Its appeal is undeniable.Congrats to the filmmakers on this wonderful first film.I hope distributors find room for this lovely film.",1
7,"""The plotters, anticipating Motana's death, ""mourn"" him as his hair, stuffed into the bodies of toads, smokes over their fire"" reads one of the title cards.  This is, after all, a documentary about the Kwakiutl Indians.  And yet, clearly, it is a directed story film.  It's an unusual sort of film these days, limited to ""novel and astonishing works of unprefigured genius"" like THE GODS MUST BE CRAZY, but in reality, this is how documentaries started.  Flaherty ""cheated""  by modern standards on NANOOK OF THE NORTH. CHANG has a story line imposed on it.  While unedited footage of Kwakiutl Indians carving totem poles might have been a big draw in 1896, by 1914 the sophisticated filmgoer demanded more:  a story line.  And so we had this, by modern standard, odd .... well, call it a ""mockumentary"", but not in the sense of a Christopher Guest film.  We see real Kwakiutls in real Kwakiutl regalia dancing real Kwakiutl war dances aboard real Kwakiutl war canoes. It's just that it's edited together and given titles to make it a story.
Interestingly, although a story film, this movie survives because it was saved at a couple of museums.  So what can we make of it?Well, make of it what you want.  A feature film from the dawn of feature films;   fascinating shots of Kwakiutl Indians when they still did these things.  Do you want egg in your beer?",1
6,"Edwin S. Curtis's primary medium was still photography; he took pictures of native peoples. This documentary about the Kwakiutls of British Columbia contains some nice images--especially those from a buoyant camera within a canoe. The animal costumes and collecting of heads is worth looking at. The story that Curtis attached to his ethnographic record is uninteresting and untrustworthy, though. The films of Robert Flaherty to the films of Michael Moore have been accused of fictionalization, but at least those narratives, true to documentary film-making or not, are entertaining. As far as making the subject interesting to me, Curtis failed. The documentary itself, however, is very old--the earliest feature-length documentary I've seen. The film itself more so than the subject has become the artifact of interest.",1
5,"Land of the War Canoes is a black and white silent film remastered in 1973. Mainly they added a sound track. All the dialogue is in Kwakiutl without subtitles. The film is in terrible shape. It needs modern day digital retouching to fix the wildly fluctuating exposure levels and age damage.It is a surprisingly long film. The plot is two tribes warring over a female. It has sorcery, head hunting, whale hunting, many tipped canoes.The best parts are the athletic dancers in clever costumes to mimic various birds, animals and insects.Everybody looks the same, so it hard to keep track of who is fighting whom.The main value of the film is how alien it is. None of the attitudes, dress, food, customs... is familiar. The beauty of the film comes from the many elegant war canoes.",-1
6,"Okay, first off, check the date - ""In the Land of the Head Hunters"" is a reconstructed and remastered print of a film made in 1914, by Edward S. Curtis, known mostly now as a photographer and ethnographer. As such, it is entirely of its time - i.e., racist, sexist and certainly specious in its depiction of a First Nations people. But valuable for all of that. The story line, for what it's worth, concerns a young son of a tribal chief who does his manhood rituals, falls in love and marries the daughter of another tribe's chieftain; this upsets the Sorceror, brother of yet another tribal chief who wanted the girl for himself - mayhem ensues, mostly in canoes but also on land, until eventually the good guy prevails. It's simplistic and definitely racist - the people are portrayed as quaintly primitive, the women are completely subservient to the men, and the main occupation of the tribes involves war and cutting off the heads of enemies.Given that this is actually set in the Pacific Northwest, between Washington State, USA, and British Columbia, Canada, the whole head- hunting aspect is completely off. Not to mention the ""primitive"" label - these peoples were highly sophisticated, just not in a form recognized (at the time) by Europeans. But the positives in this film are quite striking too. First of all, the actors are all actual members of the Kwakwaka'wakw Nation, from Vancouver Island, and the costumes, totem poles and especially the special dances are all authentic. The story, by white director Curtis, is worthless; as a bit of filmed historical information, however, the movie is quite valuable. Many scenes were lost over the past 100 years, and the restorers opted to insert still photographs (also by Curtis, of the same people) to bridge the gaps, which doesn't work all that well dramatically, but is again useful as an historical artifact; they also were able to restore the original orchestral soundtrack, which adds drama to this silent movie. Certainly not for everyone, but film historians and anthropologists might find something of value here.",1
8,"This review is of the Director's Cut(!) DVD version. I'll start with going over the bonus material. There is a well-made behind-the-scenes making-of documentary, a one hour commentary track(no, I swear, this isn't a movie) by a handful of the most important crew members, a short and excellent(though they overdid the lighting) live-action prequel, and what may only be episode 1(?) or something of the Machinima series, which is pretty funny. This FPS title has aspects of survival horror, and its marvelous atmosphere is the best part of it. The sound is especially vital to this; it is extremely carefully crafted to evoke pure psychological terror. It is not noisy, and it does not grate on the nerves. The unnerving audio, the well-composed music, not to mention the portions of this that are nearly silent all make this thoroughly creepy. Whether or not it ultimately pays off is depends on each individuals expectations. The voice acting is also immensely good, with no exceptions. Every now and then, apparitions and such show up before your eyes. This mood is frankly so effective that it successfully distracts you from the entirely linear(if well-designed and purty) levels. The replay value lies solely in the four difficulty(you can change it at any time) settings, and trying multi-player. It has a dozen maps and nine modes. A couple of them employ Reflex Time, the feature that allows you to slow down time. Now, I am compelled to point out... you are not Neo. In fact, you're not even Mouse. You can not dodge bullets. It can be useful to you, and in certain situations, necessary. And it definitely is pretty cool. I like it enables you to fire at a grenade after tossing it and, I kid you not, it will explode in mid-air. You also get to play with proximity mines and remote bombs, that you can pick up if you don't, you know, blow 'em up. Every weapon in this is unique, and has pros and cons to it. Apart from a pistol(that can be dual-wielded), an SMG, a shotgun and an assault rifle, the arsenal has stuff that is fairly sci-fi, such as the triple-barrel rocket launcher, and the particle-based thing, that either has enemies exploding in blood, or instantly burning off their skin, leaving their body as a charred skeleton. You can carry three at a time, so you have to be selective. Melee combat is an option, if it, in spite of being powerful, doesn't seem viable that often(I kinda wonder why they put that much effort into it as they clearly did... there's a nice assortment of moves). You can affect the environment to a reasonable extent. The physics engine is expertly done, you can really see the impact that you have on your surroundings. The graphics are impeccable; animations are smooth, and FX(water, reflection, etc.) are astonishing. The puffs of smoke and such if you hit other stuff than the foes can make it impossible to tell what's going on beyond the cloud; was this intentional? It is the only negative to the visual side of this. Well, apart from those red edges during RT that blur out whether or not you get attacked. And it is a tad awkward that you can activate some of the monitors you find, but not all of them, because you can't properly tell unless you point straight at them, and it'll either give the message that you can activate it or not. You may already know that this is similar to Half-Life. You always control the camera, and it remains bound to the first person perspective(that does mean that you have to look in the right directions to not miss anything). Cut-scenes often allow you to move around. Heck, you can see your arms, hands, legs and feet, if you're climbing, swimming or otherwise in a position to spot them in real life. And the AI is rather well-done. It is adaptive, and they will jump over railings to get to you, take cover, lay down suppressing fire, etc. They can hear you, see you, as well as spot you by the beam of your trusty flashlight(with batteries that die annoyingly fast... well, they recharge swiftly, too). It would be nice with a wider spectrum(gotta love that the majority of them let out a blood-curdling scream upon their demise), and for seeming imposing, this lacks one that stands out, in the ""I don't wanna be fighting *that* guy!"" way. Finally, this feels like you're in a film. Specifically, like The Ring meets Universal Soldier, as directed by John Woo. Yeah, let's be honest; this is not exactly original. It takes elements already done masterfully elsewhere, and puts them together. I'm not claiming it does a poor job of that, and it would be a shame if anyone reading this thought that I did not enjoy this, as, in both cases, nothing would be further from the truth. With that said, Max Payne did Bullet-Time, and it was better(and infinitely more helpful) there. And we've seen young, terrifying girls before. However, this might be the first VG to hold one(not to mention the adding of mind-controlled troopers to the mix, that's new), and again, it is done oh so well. The plot and the mystery are interesting(if one twist is *way* too excessively hinted at, and immediately figured out). I gotta admit, for a while, after it initially grabbed my attention(in a stranglehold), I wasn't sure why I was getting tired of it. Then I realized it: It's so repetitive. For as nifty the haunted kind of thing and the isolation is, the game-play usually consists of searching and battles against the handful of types of opposition. It grows stale. The ending isn't half bad. Not everyone will like it. The humor varies, it can make you laugh sometimes. There is disturbing content, violence(a bit of it brutal/gory), and gratuitous swearing in this. I recommend this to any fan of the concept. 8/10",1
8,"I am not the biggest shooter fan in the world. Normally, if I do play a shooter there has to be some sort of twist for it to be fun for me. In this one you have a supernatural presence throughout the game that appears here and there, usually in interludes between chapters. The story, a special missions force is sent to capture the leader of a mysterious army, an army that does whatever the leader says, a sort of clone army. Well there is more than there seems, as this little girl starts appearing here and there and really causing havoc. You spend the game trying to learn her secret and the connection between her and the military commander and even yourself. As far as shooters this one is pretty cool, I loved the shotgun weapon the best as everything else ran out of ammo a bit fast. The fighting is fast, and it is rather hard to be stealthy as the enemy soldiers lock on you rather quickly. Still, you get your shots in...there is a lot of tension too as you never know what will be thrown your way next. A few enemies are a pain even on easy level, but for the most part it was not that hard navigating through this game to the somewhat bizarre ending.",1
9,"I don't often play videogames these days, but I felt compelled to test out my new PC with this game after reading rave reviews. When it came out in 2005 it seemed to be an underdog - it received glowing comments from critics but didn't make a huge splash like Halo or Half-Life. Now, with its debut on XBox 360, it seems to be making more of a fuss; but this game is almost a year old (in its PC form) and I hadn't heard a thing about it until a few weeks ago.I found it at Circuit City and brought it home. The packaging didn't look too promising because I'm not really into tactical shooters or Army combat games, but after installing the five discs (!) onto my hard drive and running the game I immediately realized it wasn't anything like what I had expected.The storyline is effective even if it's a rip-off of the whole Asian horror cinema influence of recent years. It's basically just ""The Grudge"" with combat action as far as the story is concerned (although the actual gameplay differs from most combat shooters). You're a member of an elite squadron of marines known as ""F.E.A.R."" (it stands for something like First Encounter Action Recon, which is kind of contradictory since recon doesn't usually involve much action, but oh well).FEAR traces supernatural occurrences and your first mission is to assassinate a man who has become possessed by the spirit of a young girl who is causing him to kill and cannibalize people.The game moves through different terrain but I was surprised by how well it sets everything up. If this were a film no doubt its plot line would be sabotaged by critics but as an interactive game it works very well. It's a cinematic experience and the cut-scenes and dramatic action sequences work well - you can tell many of the high-profile action set-ups were developed extensively for the player to experience the full benefit of the ""cinematic gameplay"" advertised on the back of the box. This is the first time I've played a game and felt like almost every single level had been designed to flow in a very specific, cinematic way - Half-Life 2 was similar but a bit also enabled more free-range. FEAR kind of manipulates you into following a specific path to complete levels, but it works to this game's benefit because there are some spectacular sequences. When there's an explosion you don't just get the same effects used over and over. When you shoot someone they don't fall down the same way as every other person who falls does.It's also the creepiest game I've ever played. ""Doom 3"" wasn't scary because there were too many monsters and it became too repetitive. But FEAR works well because you never know what to expect and they don't over-do the occurrences of the supernatural. One part of the game in particular that freaked me out was when I was crouching in a ventilation shaft, and as a pipe burst and steam hissed in front of the character, the ghost-girl appears out of nowhere scurrying towards you through the dark like the creatures at the end of ""Aliens"" (I think it was a purposeful reference to the film). Very nicely done.The shift between action and supernatural works most of the time, although I think sometimes the balance is thrown off a bit. On one level in particular you spend about thirty minutes walking around an office building shooting at enemies, and suddenly the last ten minutes of the level turn into a supernatural thriller and suddenly it seems like all the ""regular"" villains have completely disappeared. And just as soon as the supernatural stuff vanishes the bad guys are back again. I think in the next game they should develop a better mix of action with supernatural in regards to integrating the enemies into the supernatural sequences as well; otherwise, it feels a bit wishy-washy.This is a small complaint. The game kept me riveted. It also features some of the best gameplay and special effects I've ever seen in a game. It takes the cinematic integration of Half-Life 2 and takes it up a notch. The cut-scenes make it feel more like an actual movie at times and the enemy AI is the best I've seen in a game since Half-Life 2 - they react realistically to what you do in the game, and interact with each other over their radios.Overall this is one of the most memorable games I've ever played and certainly following suit of Half-Life 2 as being one of the most revolutionary FPS games of the new millennium. These new game engines are changing the face of their genre and integrating cinema into the game universe in a way unlike ever before.",1
5,"Don't get me wrong, F.E.A.R. does for urban environments what Far Cry did for the outdoors. It's a great First Person Shooter and the effects of gunfights are very well done thanks to the particle physics engine of the game.In fact, for excitement it comes close to Far Cry, lacking only the vehicle driving exploits of that game to make it a better creature. This is offset by the ""bullet-time"" mode, where you go into slo-mo and can pick and fire far more accurately than you would normally. Great for those times of overwhelming odds, or if you just feel like re-enacting the Matrix.So having said that I'm impressed with the game in general it is with some regret that I have to report that all is not well in FEAR-land.Gunfire effects such as bullet-holes have a tendency to disappear with time, which is an annoyance to be found in most of these games. Having spent an inordinate amount of time taking out an enemy strongpoint and completely wrecking the joint, it is disheartening to find upon your return a few moments later that the bullet-ridden walls have healed themselves, whilst broken windows and enemy bodies still litter the place.You also can't shoot through walls either. A rifle round will handily go through any number of partition walls of the type typically found in homes and offices, yet here all the walls are bullet-proof. Not very realistic when they went to all the trouble of making the firefights look so pretty. Nothing ever seems to catch fire, either, no matter how many rockets or grenades you throw at it.Luckily this isn't too much of a problem because FEAR rarely requires you to backtrack much. The levels are extremely linear in nature and there are only rarely instances where you can choose between two routes to the same destination.Although you have a choice of weapons only two stand out as ""must haves"" in certain situations. The shotgun is handy when dealing with the near invisible assassins - let them get close then blast them - whilst the sniper rifle of choice is the futuristic Particle Cannon with its unerring accuracy and big zoom scope. For general clone soldier destruction any of the weapons will suffice, though the leader types take some hits before going down.Don't be afraid to use the ammo either, there's a plentiful supply to be had from fallen enemies, though resist the urge to carry an empty weapon around until you find more ammo. Ammunition doesn't exist in the game unless it is inside a weapon, so you'll never find clips or boxes of shells etc. When a gun is empty, throw it away and use whatever is available that isn't and you'll have no worries.The biggest problem I have with the game is the pseudo-horror element. This is sort of Ring-like in its nature and, frankly, just gets in the way. At first it'll make you jump when a phantom appears only to disintegrate before your eyes. You may even waste a few rounds of ammo on it. But, after a couple of times you can easily tell the difference between phantoms and those that will shoot back at you and you end up just ignoring them. In effect, they become a mild irritation - a nuisance. Any disseminated information is often mumbled to the extent you can't understand it.More aggravating are the horror ""cut-scenes"" designed to give you ""important"" information on the back-story to the game. Again these are destructive to the game's mood but the difference is you can't ignore them since many are laced with spectres that will harm and even kill you. Worse yet, don't forget to save the game after each of these since an untimely death will have you going through them again otherwise.The final insult in the ""horror"" stakes is the finale. You get to shoot at spectres until your sick of it, making them ""pop"". It's nowhere near as satisfying as pumping a dozen rounds into a soldier, watching him jerk around as the rounds hit then slump to the floor in a spray of blood.The last section generally is displeasing because there is less shooting of bad guys and more ""problem solving"" exercises which basically involving going from one place to another throwing switches.If you mixed the particle physics, urban environments and bullet-time of FEAR with the outdoor settings and vehicle use of Far Cry and actually made things permanently destructible and respond to damage as they would in real life then you'd have a winner. Maybe one day...In short then, a good game ruined by trying to dress it up as something it wasn't meant to be. If you ignore the horror elements as much as possible and stop playing when you reach the reactor area the game will be far more rewarding. Carry on and you'll be disappointed.",-1
8,"Do you have a game you want reviewed for its 3D playability (as opposed to standard 2D)Contact me at ratcat17@hotmail.com for a request to review your title. When it came out, F.E.A.R was a standout game. 3D works extremely well with both convergence and depth turned all the way up. Nvidia's 3D rating is Excellent and that is correct. Just like many earlier games the 3D is fabulous, some games represent in 3D but only as far as standard background will appear in depth however FEAR is completely 3D, all objects are in full depth and if you go high enough in convergence your gun will come out of the screen and hover over your keyboard. Although you probably don't want convergence set that high due to the fact that the higher convergence creates the shrinking world effect. Ceilings seem to be only inches above your head. Just about any PC will play this game these days but 3D requires just a bit more grunt. Sadly many new titles do not play well in 3D due to the complex shadows involved but you can always check the helix website for a downloadable fix. There are many 'jump out of your seat' moments in FEAR and it still holds its own after all these years. Later versions IE: Fear 2 and 3 are really just more of the same but the original story makes you think twice about crossing a small girl! ratcat17@hotmail.com for all your 3D game review requests.",1
9,"F.E.A.R. is an absolute amazing game that perfectly mixes both First Person shooter action and Horror better than any other game like it during its year.
What makes the slo-mo/bullet-time feature so good, is that it's not just an added feature to improve gameplay. The slo-motion feature is a vital part to the game and is very much a landmark for the franchise.
The story is also well made, through its use of giving the player bits of the story as they move along. It works very well with dynamics, cutting back and forth from quiet nerve-racking moments to andrenaline-inducing action.
Very good game",1
10,"When I traded my friend TimeShift for F.E.A.R, I expected it to be this crazy shoot-em-up, out of your mind thriller that never relented for a second. Of course, it was a crazy, shoot-em-up, out of your mind thriller that relented for a little bit then kicked your sorry ass into oblivion.The game follows you, the ""F.E.A.R Operative"", the ""New Guy"", the ""Rookie"", or as the boys down at Monolith call him ""The Point Man"", as he goes out on his first task with F.E.A.R, a secret special ops outfit designed to take on supernatural threats to national security. When a man goes insane at his place of business, killing employees and taking over the Replica clone soldiers using his mind, they send you in to clean up and take out the trash, and you do just that. Using your sophisticated focus ability which enables you to slow down time and kill people with more accuracy, you go through the high tech zones of Armacham territory. Armacham, if you didn't know, is a high fallutin' science corporation hellbent on creating clones controlled by mind powers, and it's their want for this that starts this mess. Now realizing what forces you face, you must make it through the slums, Armacham HQ and a secret facility to find the mastermind behind the release of the clone soldiers and take him out before the supernatural threat grows from just one town to the entire country.CONCEPT - 10/10 - I've gotta say, little girls, no matter where they be, have creeped me out since The Shining when ""Come play with us, danny"" rang through the surround sound of my living room. And the concept of a supernatural force in the form of a little girl in a red dress seemed a li'l creepy to me. Especially when I found out that this li'l girl could blast me out of a window using her mind powers to blow up everything possible. This game is about as entertaining and as gripping as ((And yes, I'm going' there again)) Half Life 2. I'd recommend it for anyone who's into gory horror stories and little girls lunging at you with the intent of spilling your throat juice all over the tiled floor.ENVIRONMENTS - 9/10 - The environments were well done. but seeing the same corridor for 10 minutes straight got a li'l nerve racking.ENEMIES - 10/10 - I have to say bravo for the AI demonstrated in the enemies of the game. They really outdid themselves. You can hide from enemies, sneak up on enemies, and they'll interact the way another player would. only complaint, the same enemies appear to often in the same places. But still, that doesn't hide the fact that these were some pretty kickass enemies.OVERALL - 10/10 - If there's ever a game that makes me turn on my closet light and check twice under my bed, it's this one. This game really shook me and that's a lot to say for a game like this. It will freak you out and you will have to play it in the dark to get the full essence of it. But a li'l game character like Alma, the dark, creepy li'l red dress girl from the game, and the exploding hallway scene will never cease to amaze gamers and this game will never cease to shake gamers to their core.",1
9,"Absolutely. This game originally came out in 2005, but I didn't start playing it until Christmas of 2015. And honestly, it's probably one of the most realistic, creepy, and decently challenging shooters I think I've ever played.Pros: -Smart AI -Dripping in atmosphere -Fantastic level design-Gunplay still really holds up Cons: -Story is a bit tough to follow-Graphics haven't aged that well, but it's not too bad -Does suffer from its fair share of glitches.But most of those cons are just nitpicks. FEAR is a fantastic game and I highly recommend it.",1

I tell you this so you understand my interpretation of the graphics may be different than some.F.E.A.R. has some of the best graphics I have seen yet. The best part in my opinion being the blood. I take time to look at some poor guy I just massacred on F.E.A.R. because it is that pretty. Also the shadows are very well done to. I like being able to see enemies advancing towards me on walls depending on the circumstances. Another nice touch is when I shoot at a wall pieces come off depending on the gun, and there is dust depending on the surface. One last thing, when you blow enemies up with explosives, you can sever limbs, and the stumps you leave him with trickle out blood, very good touch.The story to F.E.A.R. is also top notch. It sucked me in and made me want to know more about the main players. I liked how you are given little tidbits of what's going on currently by overhearing radio reports, as well as getting back story by listening to answering machines. I won't spoil the end except to say it was very satisfying.The game play is net to perfect. The enemy AI is very good. They flank you and work together, retreat if necessary. I would say they are second best to the AI on Far Cry. The slow mo effect worked really well. I was worried going into the game because slow mo effects in first person seemed liked a bad idea, but Monolith pulled it off. In fact it saved my ass countless times. One of my biggest praises of F.E.A.R. is that if you set the difficulty higher the enemies get smarter and better, they didn't simply crank up their health.F.E.A.R. has a lengthy single player campaign, and multi-player. The single player campaign, on extreme difficulty, took me about 15-20 hours to finish. The multi-player is pretty good as well. I don't play it as often as I thought I would, but it's still decent.I don't have many gripes with F.E.A.R. but there are some slight things I disliked. For instance you have a flashlight, but it's mounted on your head and only lasts about 1 minute before it has to recharge. I'm sure special forces can come up with a better solution. Secondly the multi-player seems to lack the tactical feel the single player had. It seems like a slightly better version of Counter-Strike.These things aside, F.E.A.R. rocks. I can't praise it enough. If you have a good enough PC to appreciate the graphics, and you like a game that is fun and also can scare the crap out of you, F.E.A.R. is for you.",1

9,"F.E.A.R.: First Encounter Assault Recon is mind blowing. It has Good Action, A seriously scary atmosphere, and an amazing story.I found the story a bit confusing to be honest, which is good, because that is probably what Monolith productions was going for. I tried to just play the game, and have fun, which I did.On the first time round I managed to pick up that Alma was a powerful psychic, mother of Fettel, the one you are trying to kill, who is also commanding a Battalion of Cloned Soldiers, then in a plot twist you were the other son of Alma, and Fettels brother. Harlan Wade is your grandfather, and Alice Wade is your aunt.On the second time playing, I found out much more from laptops and phones about all the experiments and who was involved, and other stuff like that.I would also recommend the other games, created by Monolith, Day 1, and even the Vivendi expansions (Extraction Point I didn't enjoy as much, but not terrible).Final Review: 9.2 / 10",1
10,"I got this game by a friend lending it to me for 2 weeks. I still have it. So basically he forgot about it and I've kept it since and I gotta say I don't feel guilty taking this great game from him.Let's talk about the story. It's not that bad, and while I won't spoil it for you, it can be pretty creepy and really interesting.In terms of graphics this game excels at it pretty well. The textures are top notch, the animation is fluent and smooth, and the lighting is ultra realistic and plays into the gameplay.The sound is pretty good too, with realistic sound affects. Music is very ambient and atmospheric, and fits the tone of the game.The gameplay is really good, with a couple of puzzles and some really scary segments that serve as the story segments as well. Gunplay is fun and satisfying and the gore makes it more satisfying too. Remember when I said that lighting played a role in the gameplay? Yeah it does in the way that if you see an enemy shadow then it's there.I only have a few issues with this game, but they are small and not game breaking by any standards. For one, the flashlight goes out pretty fast and it's annoying to have to keep flicking it on. And second, some areas of the game are pretty long, like the office. Third, some places look awful, especially the ones without lighting.So should you get this game? Yeah, it's a great game, and it's really cheap on gog. Check it out.",1
8,"I have recently completed F.E.A.R. on the xbox 360 and wanted to write a review for people who might be interested in this game.F.E.A.R. reminds me of movies like The Grudge and The Ring. You are a member of the F.E.A.R.(First Encounter Assault Recon) team which handles paranormal threats.The story is pretty cool and brings you to all kinds of places. The environments are big, dark and creepy. It reminded me of Doom 3, where you would walk through a corridor or room and suddenly you hear something behind you, you turn around and there is nothing there only to turn around again and being attacked by a horrible monster. There are lots of scary moments in the game like that.The A.I. was very challenging. They try to work out tactics, trying to flank you, smoke you out or get up behind you. They are really good team players.The graphics are really awesome, the fire and explosions effects are top notch and so are the lighting and gore effects. Your enemies can be totally obliterated, losing arms, legs, heads and other horrible ways to die. The level design is pretty good as well, although sometimes you lose your way it never gets frustrating since there are more ways to get from A to B. But I encourage to check out every corner and every inch of the environment for weapons and med kits and boosters for your health and reflex abilities.The reflex system(slow motion mode) works very well and was designed to help you out in the harder parts of the game so don't waste it on the wrong time.The sounds are very good as well, you hear voices and other creepy sounds all around you every now and then. There isn't much music it's more sounds that make you feel uncomfortable. The sound that all your guns make is also really satisfying.The weapons in this game start out like your average shooter but further on in the game you will find some new toys to play with.The multiplayer part is pretty cool as well, you have teambased games like capture the flag or team deathmatch but also normal deathmatch and other types of online or network play. The thing I would really had loved was playing the campaign in coorperative mode like in Perfect Dark Zero, Doom 3, Halo 1 and 2 and so on.There are also some bad things about F.E.A.R. like the flashlight, it doesn't last long and has to reload its batteries. I also had some problems with the melee attacks, when you carry a weapon and hit the melee button and try hit something my gun was replaced for hand to hand combat, but it didn't happen very often though. The game isn't extremely long, I completed it under 8 hours playing the normal difficulty.Overall this is an awesome game with great visuals and great action. I would recommend this game to anyone who loves first person shooters and horror.",1
10,"Since i bought this game, i am playing it over and over, because it's a very special game. Why? Because the effects...the horror this game has...it's almost as a combination of ""The Ring"" and a John Woo film. The Slow-Mo and the bullets flying through the air is almost as in The Matrix films, and the psychopath killing, and the weird story which is getting cleared minute by minute. I liked Fettel's crazy character...the one that slaughters people. And the so surprising story is making me jump off my chair. The game is so scary your fingers will start to twitch. Once you play it, you can't get your hands off it. Recommended.",1
1,"Oh my god! Seriously?! I love that this movie came out in 2016 and it was so bad there is only one review on here (before mine).I don't even know where to start! Dee Wallace?! This is what happens when you get old. You get relegated to drivel like this. She's a good actress. I feel so sorry that these are the types of roles she's not only offered but taking.Tracy Gold? Is that you?! It's so hard to believe she was actually cute a long time ago. Time has not been kind to her. When I realized it was her I could not believe it! She looks straight out of central casting for a ""slightly overweight haggard middle-aged soccer Mom from the Midwest"". It's so hard to see actresses loose their looks.The main actress looked like she was on Xanax the whole movie. So bland, quiet and boring. She looked like someone pry had to nudge her awake before each of her scenes. I think that's pry why the best friend decided to overact-she pry felt like she had to overcompensate for the fact that her co-star was just not ""bringing it"".The little Amanda Bynes look alike little sister def needs more acting lessons however those won't help that annoying lisp.The Dad had no lips and in one scene he looked like he just got done sucking on a berry popsicle. It was so distracting.The Delayna character was so over the top it was annoying and like nails on a chalkboard.The head waiter was so bad it's like they called in a grip from the set to fill in for the actor who was supposed to be in that role. ""Ok so just stand here and say a few lines. Doesn't matter how you say them...no one is gonna watch this garbage anyway.""I can't believe I kept watching this. I started to fall asleep at one point and I almost turned it off at another point but I kept thinking ""Surely it can't keep getting worse!"" It did.Even the dog was a bad ""actor"". Why was it running sideways?!You know who wasn't bad in this? The Barnaby in human form character. He actually seemed to be ok but of course he couldn't save this waste of a film.I really want to meet the people who thought this was a good idea to make this film. I'd try to find a subtle way of telling them they need to find another line of work. I mean how are these people still finding work?!This movie is so bad it was...well it was just bad! Avoid!",-1
5,"It is appropriate for young children, but it is very simple and does not offer anything new or flashy for adults, plus the special effects are horrible, I do not recommend it.",-1
3,"There is not one new or innovative idea in this entire movie.
You have seen it all before .. many many times before... and always done much much better than this production.
The production values are achingly low... even for a ""Canadian Production"".
Even by Canadian standards, the cast is exceptionally bland and totally lacking in charisma. About a third of the way into the movie you start glancing at your watch wondering if ANYTHING entertaining is going to happen in this film. There are many many other similar themed movies.... watch one of THEM. But, do not waste your time on this one.",-1
1,"This was so bad that it didn't even air on a kids' network or Hallmark (MarVista often makes movies for Hallmark.). The main problem is the villain is so over-the-top that she's completely out of place in the movie. I kind of liked the movie until she showed up. She's clearly supposed to remind you of Winifred Sanderson from Hocus Pocus because she's a cackling middle aged witch in medieval-ish garb (more like random things from a Halloween store clearance rack) hitting on younger men, but this doesn't work because she doesn't have any personality whatsoever. She's just cruising for hunks. The movie also tries to remind you of Halloweentown, by casting one of actors from it. Maybe this would've worked if she had a large role, but she only has a cameo that doesn't contribute anything to the plot. She just says that she can't be of any assistance. Probably to remind you of Twitches, the main character is in college. I guess the moral of the story is that actions have consequences and getting even gets you nowhere, but the characters are kind of old to be learning that lesson. If the main character and the evil witch were in, say, middle school, that would make more sense because they wouldn't have much life experience yet. The thing that stuck out the most, in a bad way, was that there are some really awkward jokes about the witches' familiar who alternates between his dog form and his human form. It's a dog. Let's not overthink it. I don't want to know why he licks people's faces when he's in dog form. It's just so creepy that a middle aged guy is their dog. If he were a little kid, then that would be ok.",-1
9,I love watching movies like this.. I watched A Witch's Ball before this and plan on looking for a few more like it..Movies like this are Halloween themed and make great kids movies without being overly scary. A HUGE Thumbs up for this movie!!,1
1,"I don't have a clever intro to this review, so I'm just going to cut to the chase. This movie's pace is the equivalent of walking through a room that is filled to the brim with honey. To say that this movie is slow is the equivalent of saying that water is wet. A turtle would say that this movie needs to pick up the pace. My point is, it's boring.No joke. This movie is slow as heel. This movie isn't worth turning spoilers on, because I'm one hundred percent certain that no cares about this movie (seeing that there are only two reviews for this movie and the both hate it). I've seen the worst of Disney Channel, Nickelodeon, Hallmark and Lifetime original movies and something happens in them that can at least gets an ironic laugh out of me. However, even though some things happen in this movie, nothing happens.I cannot think of a single thing that is even remotely passible about this movie. The acting is so wooden that it literal feels like watching to trees talking to each other. The cinematography is so bland that I hesitate to call it cinematography. The writing is Hocus Pocus without the silliness and the charm. The production design had less effect put into it than an essay written by a high schooler about The Scarlett Letter. The editing has all the excitement of an office cubical. Hell, even the custom design was basically just whatever the filmmakers could find at Party City. The only possible good thing I can think of is that the camera man decided to take the lens cap of the camera, turned the camera on and pointed in in the face of the actorsMy advice, skip this one and warn others to stay away from this. Trust me on this one. You, and I mean you! The person reading this at 4 in the morning surrounded by pizza boxes. You could make a make a better movie that this",-1
1,"Yes, this is a bad children's movie. The plot is pretty simplistic and it's apparent that no one got paid very much for acting in this movie. However Diane Salinger's Delayna Hallow character is so over the top that it appears that she is channeling the combination of a professional wrestler and a drag queen. I'm having a really hard time finishing this film because of Salinger's egregious overacting. She's out Shatnering William Shatner. Her broad gestures seem more suited for vaudeville and if she actually had a mustache, she'd be twirling it between her fingers. I get that she's playing an evil witch but Agnes Moorehead set the gold standard Salinger seems to be going for with her 1960s era Endora, while Salinger just stands around cackling horrifically and gesturing weirdly with long plastic fake fingernails. Not a great movie by any means but Salinger really ruins it.",-1
7,Okay the acting may not have been the best but i really liked it. the only thing i didn't like was Wade had said something about a present but we never found out what he got Eve. it makes me a little mad. i just want to know what he got her haha. sorry you can go back to reading real reviews now.,1
9,"From developer Chris Taylor, we have what is essentially the spiritual successor to Total Annihilation (TA). TA was, in my opinion, the best Real Time Strategy (RTS) game ever made, so even an updated follow up would need to be extraordinary.Supreme Commander (SupCom) did not let me down. It provides the essentials of what made TA great and adds a number of small, yet useful, improvements. In both games, the player begins with a powerful unit called a ""Commander (Com)."" The com is a builder, starting the player off with basic resource and unit producing structures, but also acting as a formidable warrior as well.TA and SupCom had/have two resources - metal and energy (mass and energy in SupCom). In order to generate these resources, the Com and builder units create structures that produce them at a constant rate. They only stop producing if they are destroyed. An interesting thing about SupCom is that the resource system is also real time, continually draining and adding to the pool at a constant rate. For example, if you wish to create a unit that costs 100 mass and 1000 energy, you don't need that in the bank, it just drains slowly from the pool over the course of unit construction. The builder units can be tasked to help build something as well - the more units are on it, the faster it is built (and the faster it drains your resources). Resource management can be tricky, but is an interesting and unique experience in the realm of RTS.TA had no middle ground between lvls 1 and 3 for resource generation with the map dependent exception of the geothermal structure - you would jump from small output lvl 1 solar collectors to super energy producing lvl 3 fusion power plants with nothing in between at lvl 2. SupCom adds intermediate resource producing structures at Tier 2. Also, metal (now mass) extractors can be upgraded by themselves - TA would require that the old extractor be reclaimed or detonated in order to place the more advanced extractor in the same place, with a construction unit.Then there is the combat! If you are used to tactical combat games, like Dawn of War, or smaller scale combat such as Age of Empires or even Starcraft, then SupCom will be an almost overwhelming experience at first. You can attack by land with infantry robots, tanks, other vehicles, and super experimental units. You can attack by sea with warships, submarines, combat hovercraft, and amphibious tanks. You can even attack by air with fighters, bombers, hovering gunships, and large experimental units. You can build defensive emplacements to protect your base, and bombard the enemy with artillery units that can hit the enemy from very long distances. And then there are the nuclear missiles that can strike anywhere on even the largest maps. But there are anti-nukes that can also be built to launch and automatically take out any incoming strategic missiles. In fact, there is an appropriate counter tactic to just about every attack method.Any criticisms? Well, the system requirements were steep for the time, and even top end machines would have some trouble now and then. The learning curve is fairly steep, and the game most certainly requires you to be on top of things nearly 100% of the time. Even small mistakes would be difficult to recover from in multiplayer games.SupCom is most certainly a different type of RTS game, and in my opinion requires a very different perspective from most entries in this genre. If you feel prepared for a game more about macromanagment with yet a hefty dose of micromanagment, then SupCom is for you. Just be prepared to be schooled in the beginning, first by the AI and later by online players. You'll definitely lose a lot before you win, but I suppose that's not too much different than most other games of skill.",1
8,"Let me just say that this game is incredible. It surpasses every bit of hype, and all of my expectations. It's amazingly fun, and the single player alone will have you hooked for a long time. The single-player is well presented, with a throwback to Starcraft (vanilla) in the mix of short pre-rendered cut-scenes, gameplay, and mission-briefings. The story here is above average, and any sci-fi fan will enjoy it.Multilayer is where this title really shines. Like Total Annihilation, this is all about macromanagement and strategy. We've got features that should have been though up years ago (movable waypoints on patrol routes come to mind), and some seriously bad-ass units. Shields are implemented better here then in any RTS previously, (they block shots that hit them, rather than giving a unit more hit points), making their use critical to success later in game. There are enough different strategies here to keep you playing for a decade at least; patches, easy-to-create mods, and expansions should add even more tactics. Resources aren't the PITA they were in Total Annihilation, as you can quickly build heavy mass or power generators that provide virtually infinite resources.Now, the down sides. There are a few minor annoyances which a patch should be able to fix (namely an inability to cue up commander upgrades, and the fact that you can't set patrol points from a new factory to match those of an existing one, resulting in a million different patrol routes by the end of the game). All in all, these are minor, and won't bother 99% of people.The big issue here is system requirements. I've tried running the game on a couple of different computers, and, I can safely say that when Chris Taylor says the game will run on a 6600, he means, it will start up. At lowest settings, the game gets single digit frame rates on a 256 meg 7600GS, on a machine with a gig of ram and a 3 ghz processor. And that's on the smallest map with two players and a unit cap of 250 (the lowest).If you want to run the game at a mediocre frame rate (20-25FPS), I would say that a 7900GT would be a minimum. Duel core and a few gigs of RAM is a must.If you enjoyed Starcraft, Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds, Age of Empires II, Total Annihilation, or Dawn of War chances are you'll love this game. It's the perfect blend of civ building and brutal combat combined with excellent strategy, assuming your machine can run it.Overall: 8/10. This would be a 10/10, had the game not lied about it's minimum requirements.",1
7,"Wilder Urlaub is based on a good, tight script and offers numerous visual treats. This is to my knowledge the only Swiss dialect movie that fully meets the requirements of the noir genre. It tells the story of a young army deserter who thinks he has killed his sergeant in an argument. He flees from his army encampment to Zurich where he arrives in a rainy night and rents a furnished room in the old town (a poor area of rather bad repute before gentrification started). He does not find rest there, his main concern being stealing civilian clothes so that he can escape to unoccupied France (the movie was made during World War Two). The soldier is confronted with different people who struggle with problems of their own and let him reconsider his actions. In the course of events he gets an opportunity to somehow relieve his conscience by telling the reason for the argument that led to his slaying the sergeant. In flashbacks the viewers are told the life story of the soldier and his acquaintance with the sergeant that started long before army service. This turns the movie into a short, sober and unbiased excursion into the Swiss social order of that time with a remarkable lack of preachyness. The soldier's bad conscience also leads to a short well directed dream sequence that seems to turn him temporarily insane. In the end he returns to his unit to face the consequences of his act.The story starts with night falling and ends at dawn the next morning. Good use is made of the blackout which was imposed in Switzerland during the war. At times the main character is running aimlessly through the completely dark city, occasionally persecuted by flashlights, his heavy army boots echoing on the cobble stones of the narrow streets in the else deadly quiet ""Altstadt"".The director of Wilder Urlaub is Franz Schnyder, German trained and famous for his treatments of the novels of Jeremias Gotthelf, idealizing rural Switzerland. The good country life (as opposed to the stifling, immoral city) is also apparent in Wilder Urlaub, as the deserter returns to his unit encamped in a village. His way back leads through a pastoral setting, resplendent in the first rays of sunlight.The script, in my opinion one of the best ever for a Swiss movie, is by Kurt Guggenheim, a writer who now is almost forgotten. A man of liberal spirit and a Swiss patriot in the very best sense of the word, his novels deal with Switzerland and the challenges its people have to face.",1
6,"In some ways, ""Wise Girl"" is much like ""You Can't Take it With You""- -the film that won the Oscar for Best Picture and Best Director just one year after ""Wise Girl"" debuted. However, despite its similarities (as both are about goofy rooming houses filled with weirdos), the film is inferior mostly because the film seems very forced--as if the director and actors act loudly in order to convey how wacky the film is supposed to be.When the film begins, you learn that the Fletchers are very rich and they are horrified that John O'Halloran (Ray Milland) is raising two little girls who belonged to the sister of Susan Fletcher (Miriam Hopkins). After all, John is poor and lives a crazy bohemian lifestyle in a strange boarding house...and he doesn't even send these two little girls to school! Susan decides to investigate all this undercover and befriends this odd family...and naturally John feels stabbed in the back when he later learns that she and her father are going to court to take the kids! However, inexplicably, Susan has fallen in love with John and also has determined to make a success of him whether he likes it or not!This film does have some cute moments though I had a hard time believing any of this and the film often got louder instead of more clever. Worth seeing but a pale imitation of the goofiness of ""You Can't Take it With You"".",1
8,"Years later the plot device of a paternal uncle and maternal aunt in a custody battle was used in the Clark Gable/Sophia Loren classic, It Happened In Naples. Only in that it was Sophia who was the Bohemian and Clark the square. Wise Girl does not have the international setting or the color location cinematography of the later film, but Ray Milland and Miriam Hopkins do play a pair of spirited antagonists.Miriam's father Henry Stephenson who is rich enough to spoil Miriam had cut off her sister back when she married out of her class. Now with both his daughter and son-in-law dead he'd like custody of his two granddaughters. Miriam will be his accomplice in that endeavor.But the trick is to get them away from their uncle Ray Milland who has them. He's a struggling artist and he supports the girls with odd jobs here and there. Miriam moves into Greenwich Village incognito to be near them all and naturally as things go in these type films she falls for Milland.Looking at the set I can see where Alfred Hitchcock got the idea for his Greenwich Village set in Rear Window. And we meet a whole lot of colorful characters there and not just through a telescope. Milland's closest friends are prizefighter Guinn Williams and aspiring actor Walter Abel who has a bit of a thirst problem. Marianna Strelby and Kim Philson play the two young girls and Margaret Dumont has a great small part as the snooty woman running the Child Welfare League.Wise Girl may not show Miriam Hopkins at her wisest, but it's a great comedy in the screwball tradition of the Thirties. Best scene is the chaos she causes at one of Guinn Williams' prizefights. Milland has his moments as well, especially trying to unsuccessfully sell vacuum cleaners door to door. All in all a lot of laughs.",1
6,"The screwball comedy had been around for quite a while in one form or another when ""My Man Godfrey"" and ""Libeled Lady"" exploded on the screen in 1936 to push the genre forward. Comic scandals concerning the rich and infamous dominated the plots of these movies where zany society got slapped down a bit. Carole Lombard and Jean Harlow quickly became the prototype heroine for the off-kilter usually blonde bombshells who got taken down a peg or two as they dealt with a no-nonsense handsome hero who was funny in spite of their alleged serious natures. In this case, the blonde heroine is that early 1930's drama queen Miriam Hopkins, playing a snooty socialite aghast that her late sisters' children are being raised by a seemingly do-nothing Greenwich Village artist (Ray Milland). To discredit him, she moves into the same building, and finds out all sorts of ammunition in order to help her father (Henry Stephenson) win custody of them.Hopkins proves herself to be an able comic, especially when she finds her small apartment being invaded as she tries to take a bath. More and more people begin to barge into the one room apartment, and before you can say ""A Night at the Opera"", she finds herself surrounded. This is a Greenwich Village which sadly no longer exists (except perhaps in revivals of ""Wonderful Town"" and ""Auntie Mame"") and where else but mid 30's downtown would you find young children who knew how to take care of a drunk without any supervision? Everything is fine up to this point and it appears that Hopkins is lightening up her feelings towards Milland, even pretending to be trashy when old society friends recognize her in an Italian restaurant while slumming. But when the kids all of a sudden are taken away thanks to Hopkins' phone conversation with her father, she all of a sudden switches gears, claiming in court that Milland is totally unfit. This is done jarringly and without any clues as to why, and for the remainder of the film, she seems determined to be out to teach him a lesson yet make up to him for her betrayal.Still entertaining in spite of this sudden jerky change, ""Wise Girl"" isn't up there with the classics of the screwball genre and Hopkins seems determined without total success to emulate the classy screwball sophistication of Lombard, Jean Arthur and especially Constance Bennett whom she often reminded me of. She does seem to work well here with the cast and it is a far cry of her attempts to outshine Bette Davis in their two later films together, making her performance a lot more relaxed and less forced. Milland is a great sparring partner, and Walter Abel and Henry Stephenson also offer good support. The kids get some good Groucho lickings in at Margaret Dumont in the court scene where she asks them some truly stupid questions in order to test their intelligence. The wise girl(s) may not be the screwball heroine, but the two nieces who were lucky enough to be taken away from the stuffy Stephenson.",1
10,"""Wise Girl"" is a riotously funny screwball comedy with many characteristic traits - and, with some nice little barbs of satire thrown in. Miriam Hopkins is the dominating female, Susan Fletcher. Ray Milland's John O'Halloran is the battling male. Any semblance of romance between them is smothered in the antics and hilarious goings-on until the very end. And the rapid-fire pace with quick, snide and witty dialog runs throughout. Along with these two protagonists, a slew of supporting characters adds to the bedlam and humor in this zany movie. The satire comes in some pointed and caustic lines. This is one of those rare screenplays that produces nearly a laugh a minute. With its fast pace, a second and third viewing bring out more of the humor one is sure to miss the first time around.Under any other situation, this film's plot would have a serious undertone. Two orphaned girls are living with their uncle, in a bohemian lifestyle in Greenwich Village, New York. Joan and Katie are under the care of Uncle John by the will of their deceased father, John's brother. Their mother had died some time before. And the girls are enamored with Uncle John and appear, hilariously, to be almost brainwashed in the bohemian way of life and beliefs. But their super rich grandfather wants to get custody of the girls to raise them properly. The inimitable movie senior, Henry Stephenson, plays the role of Mr. Simon Fletcher.A battery of attorneys tell Fletcher there is nothing he can do, so long as John has a job and can support the girls. The detectives Fletcher hired report that John often has more than one job at a time, and that he frequently loses jobs; but just as quickly finds other employment. Socialite daughter, Susan, is the girls' aunt on their mother's side. She decides to see how they might get the girls away from O'Halloran, and goes incognito as an out-of-work girl needing a place to stay. Susan weasels her way into the inner courtyard of Dermont O'Neil's lodgings, which closely resembles a circus freak show with all kinds of odd and weird characters.From there, this movie takes off with confrontations, slapstick, wacky character interludes and zany dialog and scenes. Most of the acting is excellent, and ""Wise Girl"" rates 10 stars even with one glitch in Miriam Hopkins' role. She has one fault in the sequences of rapid-fire dialog. See seems just a hair too quick, as though she is poised to pounce on the next line. So, her responses in these exchanges seem to be blurted out. It happens several times and is distracting enough to be a little irritating. It's surprising that the director or others didn't catch this in the daily rushes so Hopkins could be coached to lower the bluntness for smoother and more natural witty exchanges. A number of other actresses come to mind as being superb in such comedy - Barbara Stanwyck, Ginger Rogers, Irene Dunne, Myrna Loy, Carole Lombard.Hopkins otherwise is quite good and this is a very funny, wacky and enjoyable movie. The almost constant stream of funny and clever dialog takes place in one scenario after another with hilarious goings on. There's a brilliant rapid-fire exchange in O'Neil's pawn shop. A huge bunch of people ascend on Susan's room as she's taking a bath. A bohemian night in Mama Guido's café turns hilarious when Prince Michael shows up with a group of high class partiers and he recognizes Susan. John gets Susan an acting job in the Walker's store window where he works. The funniest scene ever in a boxing ring occurs when John and Susan work Mike's corner in a prize fight. A parade of people taunts John walking by his jail cell as he is denied food and they are eating and drinking all kinds of goodies. And a hilarious multi-party telephone conversation takes place. The latter has to be the zaniest such scenario in all of filmdom.Here are some favorite lines. See the Quotes section on this IMDb Web page of the film for more zany dialog.Mr. Simon Fletcher, ""But you can't handle this man. Why, he's an artist. He's lived abroad - in Paris, on the left bank. You know the kind of thing that goes on, on the left bank. You haven't had enough experience."" Susan Fletcher, ""You forget - I was a senior at Vassar.""Susan, ""He oughta be in a lunatic asylum.""

Jailer, ""You'd get another month for perjury.""Susan, to John in jail, ""Remember - no painty, no eaty.""",1
2,"Forced, cloying, formulaic. Do these adjectives make you want to run to rent his? Miriam Hopkins was brilliant in the original ""Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde."" A few other early movies of hers, notably ""The Story of Temple Drake,"" are never shown but said to be excellent.Here, she is cutesy, bossy, and thoroughly unappealing. Ray Milland as a Greeniwch Village bohemian not at all convincing.The two child performers are creepy and also bear no relation to the Village as it was then.Speaking as a native of Greenwich Village, I find the setting ersatz, generic, and phony. Not that I was around for a couple generations but my relatives were there in 1937. It isn't funny. It isn't remotely authentic. We don't care about the characters.So many movies were made about the struggling masses vs the capitalists at this time, and done with elan. ""Easy Living"" comes to mind. It didn't take place in the Village. But it rings very true. This rings with a thudding knell.",-1
9,"Miriam Hopkins shines as Susan ""Susie"" Fletcher, the ever-resourceful, vivacious leading lady to whom this title alludes, and Leigh Jason directs this delightful Allan Scott - Charles Norman penned Comedy from RKO-Radio Pictures, which features Marianna Strelby and Betty Philson, each in her only screen appearance, as the children quickly becoming embroidered in a bitter custody batter between their wealthy maternal grandfather, Mr. Simon Fletcher (Henry Stephenson), and their free-spirited, impoverished Bohemian paternal uncle, John O'Halloran (Ray Milland).By morning light, Susan Fletcher returns in brilliant evening gown to her wealthy father's estate, in Fletcherville, New York, several miles north of Manhattan, from whence her Russian Prince trio of escorts, Prince Michael (Ivan Lebedeff), Prince Ivan (Rafael Storm) and Prince Leopold (Gregory Gaye), transport her, to discover 1st Detective (Richard Lane) and 2nd Detective's (Tom Kennedy) meeting Simon Fletcher, to announce that they've discovered his granddaughters abiding in Greenwich Village, after returning from Europe with their guardian uncle, John O'Halloran, who works three jobs to support them.But when Simon tells Susan that he cannot legally take custody of his late daughter's children because her late husband has entrusted their care to his brother, for as long as John can provide for them, Susan realizes an idea without a workable plan, to move into Greenwich Village under the guise of a poor but friendly stranger, to see what she can do to help her nieces.(It may seem uncanny that the brother-in-law wouldn't know the sister-in-law, nor the nieces their aunt nor grandfather, but Miriam Hopkins and company make this plot to work very well because who would know what to do next in a situation as difficult as this and still maintain light-hearted manners?) Anyway, Susan packs an overnight bag, and conceals nearly $100 in cash, but making believe that she's broke and malnourished, upon arriving in Manhattan, and into the pawn shoppe of Dermot O'Neil (Alec Craig), at which John O'Halloran bargains with Flute Seller (D'Arcy Corrigan), whom Susan champions to no avail. When Susan requests of Dermot free accommodations, she finally meets nieces Katie O'Halloran (Marianna Strelby) and Joan O'Halloran (Betty Philson), who suggest that she stay in the laundry room, offering a dough-nut, before John's disapproval of her smart attire and carefree attitude.John's friends, Karl Stevens (Walter Abel), a drunken artist once married to an heiress whom Susan knows, and Mike Malloy (Guinn ""Big Boy"" Williams), a fledgling boxer, befriend ""Susie"" after George (Jean De Briac) returns and freely enters her quarters while she bathes. Not taking lightly to this lack of privacy, Susan confronts John from within the laundry tubs, as he plasters the ceiling above her entranceway. But when John later discovers the money in Susie's purse, John suspects Susie of impersonating a poor person, but Susie finds out about it after hearing Katie and Joan's gossiping in French, a language which Susan understands and clears the mistrust among them.In addition to his position at Dermot O'Neil's, John paints signs for a department store, and seconds Mike Malloy as boxing manager. Dermot tells Susie that he cannot fire John from the pawn shoppe because John owes him too much back rent, so she inadvertently gets him fired from the department store, where she takes a job as an actress in the store window, as Actor in Department Store Window (Jack Rice) makes a play for her, and John sticks up in her defense, causing Jake Kelly, Department Store Bouncer (Frank Moran) to end his employ.At her Italian restaurant, Mama Guido (Mathilde Comont) hires John to paint a wall mural and Susie to add atmosphere, but when the three Russian Princes arrive, Susan must quickly think of a plan to send them off before they recognize her, once again, costing John his commission.In the boxing ring, Mike's Fight Opponent (Frank Hagney) begins to get the better of Mike Malloy, and the Fight Referee (Eddie Gribbon) names the winner of the match, but this, neither, helps John O'Halloran and his financial situation.Now, losing jobs left and right, Susie suggests that John enter a painting contest because of his talent for fine arts, but John tosses a knife at the want ads, to select a situation as a door-to-door vacuum cleaner salesman, during which time he demonstrates for ""Fat Mother with Baby Wilbur"" (Grace Hayle) until Baby Wilbur ends up missing somewhere in the apartment.By now, Mr. Simon Fletcher has John O'Halloran right where he wants him, and arranges for a custody hearing to claim Katie and Joan. Susan, beginning to change her tune about Katie and Joan's situation, pleads with Simon to give Susan a little more time to work things through, but the ball is set into motion for John, Katie and Joan to discover Susie's true identity.Mrs. Bell-Rivington (Margaret Dumont) testifies before Chief Judge at Custody Hearing (George Irving) of the improper conditions which John O'Halloran provides for the children, with Simon Fletcher and company on one side, and John O'Halloran and friends on the other. When Joan is asked to testify, Dr. Barry, Court Psychiatrist (Maurice Cass) claims that the children remain healthy in John's unconventional environment. So, it is up to Susan Fletcher to turn the tables one way or the other once she decides how the better interests of each party involved ought to be served.But when her plan to inspire John to paint for the magazine art contest seems to backfire, Susan enlists the assistance of Motorcycle Cop #1 (Edgar Dearing) and Motorcycle Cop #2 (Eddie Dunn) ""to do a little murder,"" to frame someone to serve jail time.Russell Hicks has a role as David Larrimore, the magazine editor, who may be able to provide a helpful solution to the situation at hand, with a little edging from that ""Wise Girl"" herself, Susan Fletcher.",1
7,"Society heiress Susan Fletcher (Hopkins) and her wealthy father Simon Fletcher (Henry Stephenson) are vexed that their young nieces Joan (Betty Philson) and Katie (Marianna Strelby) are living a Bohemian lifestyle in Greenwich Village with their artist uncle John (Milland) after the death of their parents (Susan's sister and John's brother). Simon has given up trying to convince John to allow he and Susan to take care of the children and have resorted to using private detectives to catch him in either unbecoming behavior or unemployed and therefore unable to care for the children properly. Susan finally decides to take matters into her own hands and goes to Greenwich Village herself, posing as an actress, to try to gain information and/or persuade him to see reason. What she discovers however, is that she not only likes the free and artistic lifestyle John and his friends are living and that the girls are being brought up well, but that she is quickly falling in love with John. Inevitably, her true identity is discovered and she is faced with the task of convincing everyone on both sides of the custody debate who should belong with whom.I really enjoyed this film, and found that its very short running time (70 minutes) was the perfect length to spin this simple but endearing story. Miriam Hopkins, one of the great 1930's-1940's actresses is delightful in this film. Her energy, style and wholesome beauty really lend themselves to creating an endearing character, even though you know that she's pulling a fast one on the people she quickly befriends. This is the earliest film I've seen Ray Milland in, and he was actually young and non-patrician looking. (And apparently three years younger than his co-star) His energy and carefree manner in ""Wise Girl"" were a refreshing change to the demeanor he affects in his usual, darker, films. Honestly, though I am usually not remotely a fan of child actors, I really enjoyed the two young girls who played Susan's nieces. They were endearingly precocious, and were really the jewels of the film. Unfortunately, I can't dig up any other films that either of them were subsequently in after this one, which is a shame since both exhibited a large amount of natural talent.""Wise Girl"" was a film that was made three years after the Hollywood Code was instated, and to some extent, this was abundantly clear by the quick, happy ending, and the pie in the sky loftiness and ease with which the characters lived. The alleged Bohemian co-op was in fact a gorgeous cul-de-sac where the artists lived for free or for trade, and everything is tied up very nicely throughout. Fortunately, this was a light enough film and the characters were charming enough to make allowances for its fluffiness and short-comings and I was able to just take ""Wise Girl"" for what it was; a good old-fashioned love story that was as entertaining as it was endearing. Unfortunately, films of the romantic comedy/drama genre today are considerably less intelligent and entertaining, or I wouldn't find myself continuously returning to the classics. 7/10",1
6,"A girl and her rich father are keen to look after her deceased sister's daughters. However, her late brother-in-law granted custody to his brother who is an artist with a bohemian lifestyle. Lawyers say that they can do nothing so the daughter investigates.Reasonable comedy with a serious message that money cannot buy everything. Miriam Hopkins and Ray Milland star and show their comedy talents. Do watch out for James Finlayson and also Margaret Dumont in cameos.",1
7,"Sometimes it's hard to define what separates a successful, delightful comedy from one that falls flat. In this case, the contrived plot about a spoiled rich girl who schemes to take her nieces away from the Greenwich Village 'bohemian' who is raising them, only to fall for him herself, is not promising. And nothing in director Leigh Jason's filmography suggests that he was an overlooked major talent. And yet he must have been responsible for creating a relaxed, happy atmosphere on the set that was faithfully recorded on film.He also had the good sense to cast this movie properly. The one small flaw is Miriam Hopkins in a part that Ginger Rogers would have been perfect for. Hopkins is efficient but brittle, lacking the warmth and sexiness Rogers would have had. She is further hampered by a pair of bizarrely long and sooty false eyelashes that are sometimes a distraction. But a very young and very handsome Ray Milland couldn't be better in an exuberant, uninhibited comic performance of great charm.And better than that, particularly for New York City residents, is the Hollywood depiction of Greenwich Village in 1937. Though completely synthetic and idealized, it remains recognizable to a contemporary viewer. Art director Van Nest Polglase created an amiable jumble of mews apartments and ramshackle shared backyards that is the perfect backdrop for this picture's collection of artists, strivers, smart-alecks and wannabes. Best in the supporting cast is Guinn Williams, bringing sweetness and light to his role as a prizefighter-sculptor-dressmaker, suggesting the self-invention and fluidity (sexual and otherwise) of life in the Village. Even more refreshing are Betty Philson and Marianna Strelby playing the little girls. Plain, intelligent and full of humor, these girls seem like real human beings and are nothing like the professional child actors of the time.Of special interest are a couple of memorable comic set-pieces: Ray Milland's vacuum cleaner demonstration to a woman with a howling baby is played with more spontaneity than one expects (the baby and his contortions are marvelous 'found' moments) and a phony domestic 'play' in a department store window that degenerates into a free-for-all is also fun. The movie slides slowly downhill with a straight-faced custody trial and then never quite gets back on track when the action moves to Long Island, but this movie is still worth a look.",1
8,"This was a break-out film for Alan Ladd. Up until then, he'd just been performing bit roles. Here, he is given 3rd billing, but he clearly is the star of the film.Ladd plays a sociopathic hit-man who seems to have not one ounce of compassion for anyone--except animals. After fulfilling a contract, he meets with the super-sleazy guy who hired him (Laird Cregar) to get paid. Creger is great--he just drips sleaze and menace as well as cowardice! And, being a sleaze, he tries to get Ladd arrested by giving him money that was supposedly stolen. This point in the film actually made no sense--there was no reason to do this AND Ladd could always tell the cops about Creger.Miraculously, Ladd escapes arrest and vows to kill Creger and the mystery man he was working for but who was not yet revealed. He meets up with Veronica Lake and she helps him escape. Now the ironies involving him meeting up with Lake is way over the top. She is ALREADY working secretly for the government spying on Creger AND her boyfriend just happens to be the cop leading the investigation of Ladd. This and the stolen money aspect bring the overall rating down to an 8--this film could have earned a 10 due to Ladd's characterization and the interesting plot (much of the time).Instead of continuing to telling you the rest of the story and spoiling it, I will just point out that the actual story is deeper and involves selling poison gas to our enemy--the Japanese. It is then a propaganda film AND a Film Noir flick--a pretty good combination all-in-all.",1
9,"Alan Ladd in his film debut. He and Veronica Lake together in their first collaboration of four films (the others being 'The Glass Key', 'The Blue Dahlia' and 'Saigon', the last of which the only one to not be a film noir), all at least watchable and serve them well. My love for film noir, though one could argue that the film predates it and that there are noir-ish elements. A film based on the novel 'A Gun for Sale' by one of the literary greats Graham Greene.They are reasons enough to see any film, let alone 'This Gun for Hire'. 'This Gun for Hire' to me was an excellent film, with a huge amount to recommend it. Not quite a masterpiece but close, and its mostly positive reputation is more than understandable and am more than glad to be part of the positivity. A film most notable for the performances of the cast and its stylishness, though a lot is right with it.From personal tastes, the ending was a touch on the heavy handed, the patriotic element being somewhat of an awkward fit, and over-sentimental side. Other than that, 'This Gun for Hire' is a winner.Ladd's film debut is quite wonderful, can't believe it was actually a debut when he gave a performance of such icy steel. Liked a good deal of what he did and it was sad that he died too young, and still consider his performance here one of his best as one of his most demanding and most intriguing characters. Lake brings iciness, charm and vulnerability to her role and is a more than good match for Ladd, their chemistry sizzles (though it sizzles even more in 'The Blue Dahlia'). Laird Cregar plays an utter slimeball to perfection. All the cast are strong but Ladd, Lake and Cregar are the standouts here.Credit is also due to Frank Tuttle in some of the best directing, whether visually, in direction of the cast and in keeping the story interesting and tight (all of which done never less than very well), of his career. Don't think he ever did better actually. 'This Gun for Hire' looks good, nicely shot with a lot of atmosphere. The script is taut and has an appropriate hard edge and the storytelling, while not quite as deep or as thrilling as Greene's source material, flies by and has the right amount of tension. At less than 80 minutes, would usually find that too short a length for a film but this is a not so common case of the length not being a problem.In conclusion, excellent. 9/10",1
9,"The film that launched Alan Ladd's career, This Gun For Hire is a very short film like the earlier Public Enemy which gave James Cagney his stardom. This would be the normal length of a B film, but it definitely gets all it wants to say in its brief running time.Essentially we have three stories where all the principal players get brought together in the end. The first involves Robert Preston investigating a reported payroll robbery of the firm that Tully Marshall is the president of. Note that I said 'reported robbery.' The second involves his girl friend, entertainer Veronica Lake being recruited by no one less than a United States Senator to get the goods on one of Marshall's top aides, Laird Cregar who they think is doing some fifth column work at the behest of Marshall. Finally we have contract killer Alan Ladd who's hired by Cregar to bump off Frank Ferguson who is blackmailing Marshall as to his treasonous activities. Preston, Ladd, and Lake don't know they are all on the same case, but by the end of the film they do.Alan Ladd became Paramount's answer to Humphrey Bogart as a star of action/adventure films and noir films. This Gun for Hire launched his career. He was enormously popular through the Forties, Paramount's biggest star after Crosby and Hope. He played cynical tough guys in modern films, but then branched into westerns where for the most part he was the gallant hero. In fact the ultimate gallant white knight hero in Shane.His part as Raven is a difficult one, yet he pulls it off. He's a cold blooded contract killer, one of the earliest ever portrayed as a film protagonist. Yet he's human and you see flashes of it, his concern for cats. As a cat lover, I can sure identify with that. Raven is also one of the earliest characters in cinema who talks about child abuse making him what he is. Groundbreaking when you think about it.Next to Ladd, the biggest kudos have to go to Laird Cregar, borrowed from 20th Century Fox to play Willard Gates. Gates is a top company executive with Marshall's firm which is a defense contractor which is why the Senate is interested in him. He's basically a jerk who thinks he's so clever. Veronica Lake gets to him real easy because of his weakness for the nightclub scene. And he really doesn't take the full measure of Raven, even though the audience is very aware of how deadly he is.When you think about it what Cregar and Marshall do is unbelievably stupid. They hire Ladd to kill Ferguson and then pay him with hot money, from the alleged robbery. Why would you do that? Chances are in the rackets they're involved in, they might have need of his services in the future. Not a guy to get mad at you. In fact their double cross is what sets the whole film plot in motion. Moral is never double cross a guy who says and means that ""I'm my own police.""This Gun for Hire was Director Frank Tuttle's finest film. He was a contract director for Paramount who did a whole bunch of films with their various stars in the Thirties and Forties. When he hadn't worked in a while, Alan Ladd got him a job directing him in Hell On Frisco Bay while he was at Warner Brothers and Tuttle also directed A Cry In the Night which Ladd produced. Ladd remembered and was grateful to Tuttle for helping break through into top star ranks. Ladd was like John Wayne that way, ever ready to help a colleague down on his luck.Veronica Lake is recruited by a U.S. Senator with a fictitious name, but in fact there was a committee looking into all kinds of things like this in the Senate in regard to the conduct of the war. It was headed by a Senator from Missouri named Harry Truman who went on to higher office. I wonder if Truman liked This Gun for Hire? Veronica Lake got a big boost in her career. She and Ladd became a classic screen team as a result of this film.This film is one great cinematic classic, so important to so many careers and still keeps you on the edge of your seat today.",1
7,"Philip Raven (Alan Ladd) is a harden killer hired by Gates to kill Baker who was a blackmailer. Raven recovers a chemical formula for Gates but he is double-crossed when he is paid with marked bills that have been reported to the police. LAPD detective Michael Crane (Robert Preston) has traveled to San Francisco to track down the bills for Gates and his boss Brewster who runs Nitro Chemical. Meanwhile Crane's girlfriend Ellen Graham (Veronica Lake) is a magician/singer who auditions for Gates's nightclub. She is approached by Senator Burnett who tells her about a plot to sell a deadly toxic gas formula to Japan. He asks her to spy on Gates and his boss after getting the nightclub job in LA. By coincidence, Ellen Graham happens to sit right next to Raven as he travels by train to LA to track down Gates and find out who is behind his double-cross.I love some of the hardboiled dialog. Overall, it's a compelling fun thriller noir. I love Veronica Lake although she has an unusual job as a magician in this movie. Maybe it's in the Graham Greene's novel, but they should have just changed her into a simple singer. Also the story has a few too many coincidences. The gas masks in the last act are a bit too much. Alan Ladd is a little too babyfaced to be that hard character. Even with all of these minor problems, the overall sense is one of thrills and spills.",1
8,"Phillip Raven (Alan Ladd) is a hit-man hired by Willard Gates (Laird Cregar) to execute the blackmailer Albert Baker (Frank Ferguson) and retrieve a letter and some documents for his unknown boss. When the work is done, Raven is double-crossed by Gates, receiving marked ten dollar bills. Gates delivers the list with the serial number of the bills to the police, expecting they find and kill Raven. Meanwhile, the performer Ellen Graham (Veronika Lake), who is the fiancée of the L.A Detective Lieutenant Michael Crane (Robert Preston), is contacted by Senator Burnett (Roger Imhof) and asked to help investigating Gates. She accepts the invitation, and is hired by Gates to work in his private club in Los Angeles. The police force, leaded by Det. Crane, chases Raven for the death of Baker; Raven chases Gates and his unknown boss, expecting to kill them for their betrayal; Ellen secretly chases Gates for the government. This is the beginning of a great classic. Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake have fantastic performances in this movie. Alan Ladd is magnificent in the role of a cold blood killer, needy of a friend, that loves cats. In order to show the personality of his character, there is a scene in the beginning of the story, where he almost shoots a crippled girl to eliminate any possible witness of his murder. Veronika Lake is wonderful and very gorgeous, inclusive singing two songs. I disagree with the reference of film-noir for ""This Gun For Hire"", since there is no ""femme-fatale"", no dirty cop, no weak man (other than Gates) or sordid motivation. Indeed it is a police story, showing a cold-blood hit-man without compassion, capable of killing without showing any emotion, hunting ""worse guys"" looking for his personal vengeance. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Alma Torturada"" (""Tortured Soul"")",1
8,"What's not to like about ""This Gun For Hire"" if you're a noir fan. It's the film that 'introduced' Alan Ladd to moviegoers, even if he did have a couple dozen uncredited movie appearances by this time. You'd probably consider Ladd's character The Raven as pretty one dimensional; it would be hard to find another bad guy as cold blooded as The Raven, and he maintained that persona throughout. I almost believed he was going to gun down that crippled little girl on the steps until he thought better of it. He didn't even break character when Ellen Graham (Veronica Lake) put her hand on his thigh in that one scene. Me, my knees went wobbly at the thought.The funny thing about Veronica Lake is that depending on the lighting and the angle of her face, it's sometimes difficult to say whether she's a looker or not. In this picture the nod goes to the looker aspect of her character. You would think the men in the story would have been more head over heels for her, but it wasn't totally her show. As for Robert Preston, this could have been a no-show on his part for all that he was required to do. And getting top billing at that. Nice gig if you can get it.It's funny too how you can take a story about a poison gas formula being sold to the Japanese and raise it to the level of intrigue as done here. The Charlie Chan flicks used that formula three times without nearly the same results (Murder Over New York, The Jade Mask, Docks of New Orleans), but then again, they never had Ladd, Lake or Laird Cregar on board. Man, you could just feel the sweat pouring off Cregar's character, Willard Gates. What a slime ball.You know, I like Alan Ladd and I'm glad he got his shot here. In fact, ""Shane' is one of my favorite Westerns, but consider what a real bad guy like Robert Mitchum might have done with the role of The Raven. I think he would have done the hit on the little girl.",1
6,"Nice tale of Alan Ladd as an all-business bravo. He rubs out somebody for Laird Cregar but Cregar double crosses him, tips the police and they're after Ladd. And Ladd is after Cregar and after the old dude who hired Cregar as well, the motive being revenge. It all has to do with the fact that the ancient tycoon has funded the invention of a poison gas which he has sold on the global spot market to the highest bidder, in this case the Japanese.Kids, this was 1942, see, and the United States was at war with Japan, Germany, and Italy. So selling poison gas to our enemy was not the most patriotic thing to do. Also it was illegal. That makes Laird Cregar and all those associated with him -- whether ancient boss or tough subordinate -- traitors. Look up ""traitor"" in the dictionary. You can see here how it's spelled. PS: We won the war.Well, Laird Cregar may be a fat and unscrupulous eater of peppermints but he's the most interesting character in the movie. There are no more gripping shots in cinema than the ultra-short Alan Ladd standing next to the abundance of Laird Cregar. He's a Mount Everest of Jello. He shivers with fear when his body guard, Marc Lawerence, describes with relish what's going to happen to Veronica Lake's dead body after it settles to the bottom of the reservoir, weighted down with iron. ""It's revolting,"" he wheezes. What I'm getting at is that the writers have provided the movie with one of the essentials of any successful production -- the interesting villain.Ladd is kind of interesting too, but not so much. He's a killer because he was beaten as a child. (Ho hum.) I made a point of beating my kid every day whether he needed it or not. That kid is a famous orthodontist today. He never kills anybody, though he does smile slightly when he plies his syringes, hacksaws, and monkey wrenches and watches his patients writhe and scream.In any case, Ladd develops a sympathetic friendship with Veronica Lake. They belong together. Ladd was five feet, six inches tall. Lake was four feet, eleven. Neither was a bravura performer but they got the job done. Robert Preston appears as the police lieutenant who is engaged to Lake. Preston had a film career that lasted from 1938 to 1985. That's pretty long. He played everything from treacherous villains to musical comedy.Actually it's a pretty enjoyable movie with some nice location shooting and particularly effective lighting and photography. Shot in Los Angeles, there are few middle-class houses here, but rather gas works, industrial plants, and railroad yards. The imagery carries a lot of unusual texture.",1
7,"Both Alan Ladd and Tyrone Power made their film debuts in 1932's Tom Brown of Culver; by 1936, Power was a star. It took Alan Ladd a long 10 years and something like 40 films to make it, but make it he did as a cat-loving contract killer in ""This Gun for Hire,"" also starring Veronica Lake, Laird Cregar and Robert Preston. Ladd plays Phillip Raven, a contract killer in San Francisco who is hired to ""off"" a blackmailer and retrieve a formula from him. What he doesn't know is that his employers paid him in marked bills and then reported him to the police as the killer of the man, hoping to get him out of the way. Their plan is to sell the formula to the Germans. A Senate committee is suspicious of one of the traitors, a night-club owner named Willard Gates (Cregar) and send in a performer, Ellen Graham (Lake) to work undercover for them, unbeknownst to her LA policeman boyfriend (Preston). Graham and Raven are mistakenly connected by Gates, and soon both are on the run from him.""This Gun for Hire"" is thickly plotted but nevertheless somehow holds the viewer's interest, most likely because of the characterizations. The diminutive, beautiful Lake is an absolute delight as a singer with a magician routine. As one of the villains, Laird Cregar creates an excellent character - a hugely built fraidy-cat who abhors violence. And Ladd's Phillip Raven, vicious though he is, is a man who learned in childhood not to trust anyone and not to get too close to anyone. He's a sad character - and this is as close to acting from Ladd as you'll get. In future films, he says his lines in a monotone, though his tough guy persona is very effective. Here, he plays a ruthless man given to outbursts as well as depression. His paired with Lake, which perhaps was continued because she was a good height for him, is heaven-sent - these are two noir actors who fit the genre perfectly, if for different reasons.""This Gun for Hire"" makes for compelling drama, but it's sad to watch as well. Cregar died two years after the film's release, at the age of 28, with what would have been a great career lost; after a failed suicide attempt (his mother was a suicide), Ladd would die of an alcohol and drug overdose at the age of 51; and the rage with her peek-a-boo hairdo, Lake, by the '50s, would be an alcoholic working as a bartender in a hotel before dying at age 54. You could say this is a ""curse"" film, but one can say that about so many - the lives of the people who made these classics just weren't fun. A shame, because they left us with such great work.",1
7,"Very good Film-Noir starring Alan Ladd as Phillip Raven, an assassin who is paid for his last assignment with counterfeit bills by sleazy Willard Gates(Laird Cregar). Gates by day works for a wealthy chemist and at night operates a night club. Raven passes one of the phony bills and is now being hunted by police lieutenant Michael Crane(Robert Preston). By chance, Crane's girlfriend Ellen(Veronica Lake)is a singer just hired by Gates. While on a train to Los Angeles, she meets Raven and realizes that he is trying to find the same man she has been recruited to turn over to a government probe into illegal activities. Gates not only a blackmailer, but also a traitor. Well photographed and launches Ladds career. Lake is just plain mesmerizing. Also in this thriller: Tully Marshall, Marc Lawrence and Olin Howland.",1
9,"Phillip Raven is a hit man of no obvious moral fibre, he literally will kill anyone for the right price. After fulfilling a contract for the chocolate munching Willard Gates, he finds himself pursued by the law on account that he was paid by Gates with stolen money. Raven sets out for the ultimate revenge and dovetailing towards the explosive finale with him is sultry conjurer Ellen Graham and honest cop Michael Crane.Based on the Graham Greene novel A Gun For Sale, this is not a straight out adaptation, the plot has been re-jigged with very impressive results. The most enlightening thing I found when reading up on the film was that the studio were so blown away by the efforts of Alan Ladd as Raven, they turned the script around to make him the films chief axis, and boy what a smart move that was for this is Alan Ladd's show all the way.Ladd plays Raven with brilliant icy veneer, he's cold and devoid of emotion, his only trip to anything resembling caring is an affinity to cats because in his own words, ""cats don't need anyone, they are on their own, just like me"", the result is one of the most unnerving killers put on to the 40s cinema screens. Veronica Lake is the stunning female of the piece, she glides through the picture with ease as Ellen, a character with her own issues, but thankfully she's integral outside of any sort of romantic plot, even though she is the only one who gets close enough to Raven to learn anything about what makes him tick.Robert Preston as Michael Crane was to be the pics focus but he becomes a mere side part thanks to Ladd's barnstorming show, and unsurprisingly Laird Cregar is suitably shifty as Gates. It's a fine film in its own right, it's tightly filmed, wonderfully scripted and contains a great noir ending, but ultimately it's all about the cold as death hit-man Raven, and the great performance by the man who played him. 8.5/10",1
7,"Hard-biting crime drama with a hired gun, Philip Raven(Alan Ladd, in his first starring role) who takes out a blackmailer and his secretary(she was in the wrong place at the wrong time, collateral damage)for a client, Willard Gates(Laird Cregar, HANOVER SQUARE; THE LODGER), working for the head honcho of a chemical plant. The victim, Baker, was holding onto something that would implicate Mr. Alvin Brewster(Tully Marshall), and he needed it back. When Gates and Brewster attempt to betray Raven, the movie follows his journey to get even.Laird Cregar works as an executive for Nitro Chemical, owns an LA nightclub known as The Neptune Club, and could be associated with ""foreign agents"". It's his boss who hired Raven to kill the blackmailer and set up the assassin using stolen 10 dollar marked bills ""stolen from the company"". The elegant ""magic performance artist"" Veronica Lake(va va voom! What a voice and figure, these kinds of women are definitely missed)is commissioned to ""go undercover"" and attempt to see if Cregar is in fact a traitor to his country by performing for his Neptune club. Meanwhile Raven must elude the cops, led by detective Crane(Robert Preston), after being shanghaied by the conniving Cregar and his nefarious boss, Brewster.Raven has a broken left wrist with a bone protruding, a nasty attitude and cold personality with one fixed facial expression devoid of any semblance of humanity, with one goal in mind and that is to find Gates and the Nitro Chemical chairman(a sickly old man confined to a wheelchair who cannot talk very loudly)to exact revenge for doublecrossing him. This is the kind of killer who can shoot a person if he or she places him in a dangerous predicament which threatens his own existence.What a great cast. Ladd as the cold blooded professional killer, Cregar as a worried, nervy executive always bumbling into mistakes which makes his boss angry, the glamorous Veronica Lake and her sex appeal, the enthusiastic Preston, sure he will catch his man and excited(obviously)about wedding Lake as soon as her job is complete, Marc Lawrence as Cregar's trusting chauffeur, willing to kill Lake so his boss would not be harmed —it's always fun to watch a collection of talents at work. The movie's McGuffin is a formula for poison gas, Brewster in league with the dreaded Japanese, and Baker, the one killed by Raven, wanted hush money for it. It's Brewster's distrust in anyone with knowledge of the formula which eventually comes back to haunt him. Seeing Cregar all cowardly and panicky is a hoot, such a pathetic scaredy-cat he is, only caring for his own hide, concerned for his own welfare. Ladd may be a bit too good-looking for a hardened criminal, beat by his aunt as a child, this traumatizing past having shaped his Philip Raven into a killer. Preston as his dogged rival, pressed for time by his superiors to catch Ladd or else be replaced by someone who can, is interesting, cast-against-type as the good guy, even though he excels at portraying villains. Lake is top-billed and deservedly so, her overwhelming beauty an asset for any film. Movie is said to have been an inspiration in many ways to Melville's masterpiece, Le Samouraï.",1
8,"Alan Ladd is one cool customer in the role that officially introduced him. He plays Raven, an underworld hit-man who's double crossed by a treasonous client, who pays him with stolen money. Taking it on the lam, he hooks up with a sultry chanteuse, Ellen Graham (the absolutely stunning Veronica Lake). She does warm up to him after a while, and tries to help him, although he's stubbornly determined to find his clients and exact some good old- fashioned revenge.Based on the novel by Graham Greene, this is a very effective and well told story. Directed with style by Frank Tuttle, it has an excellent forward momentum and gives all of the major players a real chance to shine. Hard boiled and bitter, Raven does reveal what makes him tick late in the game, and it humanizes a character who's very much the antihero at first. Ellen seizes upon this, hoping she can stir some sort of patriotism within a man with a well developed sense of selfishness. The filmmaking is first rate - the lighting, the editing, the scoring, everything.The acting is just right from this well chosen cast. Ladd is compelling in his star making performance, and it's hard to take your eyes off of Lake. Robert Preston has a less interesting role as a conventional sort of cop hero, but he makes the most of it. The sadly short lived Laird Cregar is a hoot as a sniveling weasel. Tully Marshall, Marc Lawrence, Olin Howland, Roger Imhof, Pamela Blake, and Frank Ferguson all make solid contributions.Essential viewing for any fan of the film noir genre.Eight out of 10.",1
6,"THIS GUN FOR HIRE is a fascinating, grim look at a hired killer (ALAN LADD), a corrupt boss (LAIRD CREGAR), a gutsy femme fatale blonde (VERONICA LAKE), and the detective (ROBERT PRESTON)who has a hard time getting his hands on the much wanted criminals and their cunning ways.Paramount wisely cast ALAN LADD in his first starring role as Raven, put him opposite the very attractive and petite VERONICA LAKE, and added LAIRD CREGAR and ROBERT PRESTON for box-office insurance. The film is loaded with wartime references, propaganda, murder, blackmail, and all the usual ingredients that make good film noir. It's played very effectively by the entire cast and runs a brisk 80 minutes that moves quickly and assuredly under Frank Tuttle's direction.Ladd makes an interesting character out of his cold blooded killer, stroking a cat as easily as killing it when he has to. His deadpan expression is not a hindrance in this case, his tight-lipped demeanor perfectly acceptable since he's playing such a heartless criminal.Lake is equally effective as the woman who finds herself drawn inexplicably to his character, even helping him avoid detection at one crucial point in the plot. But I thought her nightclub act for Cregar was a bit hokey when it came to the magic.Cregar does his usual outstanding job in a well scripted villainous role, stealing almost every scene he's in.Summing up: For once, Graham Greene has no reason to complain about the way Hollywood treated one of his novels.",1
7,"Journeyman director Frank Tuttle lucked in to Alan Ladd who was just about ready to take his place as a leading man after several years as a bit player. Graham Greene's A Gun For Sale makes a transatlantic crossing from the English Midlands to the Pacific coast of America with Ladd turning in a fine performance as assassin-for-hire Raven and despite lukewarm chemistry at best between himself and Veronica Lake the studio continued to co-star them several more times. Top-billed Robert Preston just about turned up and gave little indication of the fine actor he would become. Laird Cregar, dead at 30 two years later, garnered the lion's share of the acting honours as the villain of the piece. Stands up reasonably well.",1
8,"When hit man Philip Raven (Alan Ladd) successfully completes a job, his sleazy employer Willard Gates (Laird Cregar) pays him with stolen marked bills. Raven sets out to get revenge but along the way meets and befriends nightclub singer Ellen Graham (Veronica Lake), who's been recruited by the government to prove Gates is working with foreign agents. She's also the girlfriend of the police lieutenant (Robert Preston) in charge of hunting down Raven.The movie that made Alan Ladd a star and the first to pair him with Veronica Lake. It's an exciting blend of film noir and WW2 espionage movies. Ladd's terrific as the killer with a soft spot for kittens and crippled kids who's stirred to do the right thing. Lake is very likable and cute. Although Ladd's not her love interest in this film, she has far more chemistry with him than bland Robert Preston. Laird Cregar is a wonderfully unsympathetic villain. He's just a slimeball through and through. Tully Marshall is fun as Cregar's boss. It's a great-looking movie with snappy and memorable dialogue, moody atmosphere, and even some nice humor here and there.",1
6,"A 7.7 rating at IMDb huh? The appeal of this film noir, the first pairing of Veronica Lake and Alan Ladd, largely escapes me.The movie is based on a thrilling Graham Greene novel called ""A Gun for Sale,"" but it's been reset in San Francisco during WWII and is more a sketch of the novel rather than a full-blown adaptation. Ladd is the hit man on the run, out to seek revenge for being double crossed. Lake is the blonde beauty who ends up as his sort-of accomplice. The film is sluggishly paced and feels much longer than its 80 minutes. Much of the local color and atmospherics that make Greene's novels so much fun is lost, and even set pieces taken from the novel, like a stakeout in a rail yard or a finale that evokes the eerie image of everyone wearing gas masks, aren't taken full advantage of. Ladd and Lake are always a sizzling pair, but their relationship isn't fleshed out by the screenplay, and we don't have much chance to invest anything in any of the characters.Maybe an important film in the development of so many film noir archetypes, but as a movie this one is completely overshadowed by so many better films that would come out later.Grade: B",1
7,"Alan Ladd stars as Philip Raven, who was hired by Willard Gates(played by Laird Cregar) to pay off two blackmailers. When they try to pull a fast one, Raven kills them both, which is just fine with Gates, except he double-crosses Raven by paying him with hot money. Now wanted by the police, he goes after Gates. Meanwhile, Gates is also wanted by the government, who enlist the aid of Nightclub singer/magician Ellen Graham(played by the sultry Veronica Lake) to ingratiate herself with Gates(who owns nightclubs) in order to gather evidence against him. She agrees, but cannot tell her fiancée, a police detective named Michael Crane(played by Robert Preston) who is after Raven, who manages to meet up with Ellen on a train, where they team up to not only take down Gates, but his traitorous employer Alvin Brewster(played by Tully Marshall).Involved story is still most entertaining and enjoyable, with a fine cast and efficient direction by Frank Tuttle. A Good old-fashioned patriotic film not made anymore, though as a cat lover, Raven isn't so bad at all!(He does redeem himself, and no cornball romance with Ellen either!)",1
8,"This Gun for Hire was one of the earlier films in the film noir cycle, and was clearly shot on a budget; but in spite of that, this is still an excellent little thriller and one that all fans of noir will surely enjoy! The film works because of its compelling plot and intriguing characters; and it's also surprisingly dark and atmospheric. The film features a breakout role for Alan Ladd, who would go on to star in a number of noir flicks throughout the forties; and it also features a role for the beautiful Veronica Lake. The film focuses on cat loving hit-man Philip Raven. Raven does a job which involves killing the chemist and gets paid for it, but is not happy when he realises that he's been paid in hot bills. The police are soon on his tail; but Raven is smart enough to give them the slip and decides to go after his former employers. Meanwhile, a policeman's girlfriend who works as a nightclub entertainer takes a job with the hit-man's employers; and their paths inevitably cross.The film is very short at only seventy eight minutes, but director Frank Tuttle makes good use of this time and the film remains captivating for its duration. The plot flows very well indeed and things are kept very tight which helps to keep things entertaining. The central performance courtesy of Alan Ladd is excellent and the actor really does a good job in creating the right atmosphere for his character and it does the film a lot of favours. Starring opposite him is Veronica Lake who is given less to do but is never the less impressive. The atmosphere is very dark and the film draws suspense from this which ensures that it's always satisfying. The lead character is the main source of interest, and he's certainly very interesting; but there's also plenty going on in terms of the plot. The film is not as complex as some other films in the noir cycle; but it's fun and entertaining to watch and I'm sure any noir fan that catches this film will enjoy it. Recommended.",1
8,"From the furious opening where Alan Ladd slaps the maid round the face and rips her dress to the slightly sentimental and patriotic ending as Veronica Lake asks the outclassed Robert Preston to 'Hold me', this is one amazingly creative and varied, noir ride. With decent dialogue, gutsy action, great indoor cabaret sequences and scintillating outdoor location shooting, this seems to have everything. The gas works and rail yard scenes are most impressive but so too are the earlier more ruthless ones with one on one action. Tremendous stuff and only slightly let down by Preston's seeming lacklustre performance and those now cloying but understandable references to the concurrent war. Indeed, the Pearl Harbour attack took place whilst this film was being made and it was perhaps rather inevitable a little anti-Japanese sentiment might creep in. A fine noir with a great start, a great finish, birth of the Ladd/Lake partnership and comprising fast moving, exciting and economical film making.",1
8,"This film launched the career of Alan Ladd as a great actor playing the role as Philip Raven who had a horrible childhood and developed a criminal mind that just wanted to kill and he became a hired killer. Laird Cregar, ""The Lodger"", (Willard Gates) hires Philip Raven to do away with a certain person but it becomes more than just a killing, it involves a spy operation in America dealing with Japan and secret chemical formulas. Veronica Lake, (Ellen Graham) is a night club performer who does magic tricks and gets herself involved with Willard Gates who also has a night club and hires her to perform there. Robert Preston, (Det. Lt. Michael Crane) gets involved with this case and his girlfriend is Ellen Graham. There is plenty of action involved in this film and it will keep you glued to your seat until the very end. A fantastic film with all outstanding actors and a classic that will be appreciated for many many years to come. Enjoy.",1
7,"""This Gun for Hire"" is based on the novel A Gun for Sale by Graham Greene, which was published in 1936, although it updates the action from pre-war Britain to wartime California. Philip Raven is a San Francisco hit man who is hired by Willard Gates, a senior executive of a chemical company, to kill a blackmailer. Raven carries out the killing, but is then double-crossed by Gates who pays him with marked banknotes, which have been reported to the police as having been stolen in a robbery. As in many films noirs, the plot is a complex one, but there are two main strands which gradually come together- Raven's pursuit of revenge against Gates, and the police investigation into the killing of the blackmailer, in the course of which they uncover a spy ring plotting to sell American military secrets to the Japanese. It turns out that the main figures in this plot are Gates and his company president Alvin Brewster.What sets the film apart from many wartime spy thrillers is the quality of the acting, with three performances in particular standing out, from Laird Cregar, Veronica Lake and Alan Ladd. Cregar is excellent as Gates, whom he plays with a cultivated British accent. (Cregar was born in Philadelphia but educated at Winchester College, one of England's beast-known public schools). Gates's soft-spoken voice, however, belies his vicious nature; he claims to dislike violence, by which he means that he is too cowardly to carry out killings in person, but has no compunction about using others to kill on his behalf.Films noirs often featured a sultry-looking, husky-voiced blonde, and that role is taken here by. Unlike, however, the sultry blondes played by other noir actresses such as Gloria Grahame and Lizabeth Scott, Lake's character Ellen Graham is not a seductive femme fatale but rather the detective-hero's girlfriend who plays an important role in bringing the villains to book.Officially, Robert Preston as the detective Michael Crane is the film's male lead, but it is Ladd, in his first major role, who is its real star, making Raven a compelling, charismatic figure for all his villainy. At first we simply see him as a cold-blooded killer, but later we learn of his tragic background in his youth, which influenced him towards a life of crime, and under Ellen's influence he reveals another side to his character; she is able to appeal to his patriotism and sense of honour to persuade him to help her and Crane frustrate the designs of Gates and Brewster. Someone was obviously impressed by the screen chemistry between Ladd and Lake, because they would later go on to star in several more films together. (Legend has it, however, that the reason they were teamed together is because the diminutive Ladd needed an even more diminutive screen partner; some other Hollywood goddesses would have towered above him).One of the defining characteristics of film noir is often said to be moral ambiguity, by which is normally meant that the heroes of such films are frequently flawed or less than unambiguously virtuous or heroic; a good example is Glenn Ford's detective in ""The Big Heat"". ""This Gun for Hire"" is not morally ambiguous in this sense; it is a patriotic wartime propaganda picture in which the hero, Crane, is a classic good-guy type on the trail of a despicable gang of traitors.The film does, however, make use of another type of moral ambiguity, in that it features a villain who is less than unambiguously villainous, and this is doubtless the reason why it is normally classified as film noir. (It also makes use of some typically dramatic noir photograph, with sharp contrasts of light and dark and many scenes taking place at night or in darkened rooms). The film critic for The New York Times described in 1942 as a ""fast and exciting melodrama"", and unlike some wartime thrillers this one remains watchable today. The modern film buff, however, is less likely to watch it for its melodrama than for its acting and for the disturbingly ambiguous characterisation of its anti-hero Raven. 7/10",1

5,"If your idea of a good time is watching some druggie rock star bonking a famous Playboy bunny then this ""movie"" will certainly fulfill you. It is, at least, leagues better than that awful Paris Hilton tape. However, in general, I just have a hard time of finding entertainment in watching two famous people going at it for an hour. Maybe it's just me.Let's give a rundown of what occurs in this film, though:Pamela Anderson has sex with Tommy Lee in a moving car - Pamela Anderson has sex with Tommy Lee on a private boat - Pamela Anderson has sex with Tommy Lee in her private trailerI'm sure it must have been hard for her to be ""cinematographer"" while having to perform the sexual acts. I also like how she's credited as ""Makeup Artist.""Makeup for what?Maybe I don't really want to know.",-1
10,"This video is hardly a sex-tape as we have much more than intimate moments. In addition, the watchers will be disappointed as we don't see a lot of things ! On the other hand, those who wonder how a Hollywood celebrity lives, this stolen private tape is extraordinary : we can see that Pamela had a poor wedding ceremony, that her house seems totally ordinary, that her vacations are really simple. Well, in a sense, she is like us ! As i don't have subtitles, i didn't really understand their discussions but i felt that the two were in love ! And what i keep in mind at the end is that Pam was clearly this down-to-earth and kind girl, very faraway of the divas ( without forgetting that she was indeed a true sexy vixen to have fun with ! )",1
2,"Your garden-variety professional porn flick consists of a variety of sex acts performed by attractive--to varying degrees--people. Your garden- variety ""amateur"" porn flick consists of a variety of sex acts performed by not particularly attractive--to varying degrees--people. This ""film"" is neither a professional porn flick nor is it really an ""amateur"" one. Pamela Anderson is, it is generally agreed, extremely attractive and extremely sexy. Her husband, musician Tommy Lee, is neither, but since he's the one using the camera, most of the focus of the film is on him, and it's' not a pretty sight. I can't think of too many people who are eager to gaze at his skinny, spindly, tattooed body--although he seems to be enamored of it, considering how much time he spends showing it--but the most revealing part of this tape isn't the sexual content of it. As many other posters have noted, the sex scenes are so poorly shot as to be barely visible at times, but Pam and Tommy Lee prove once and for all that pretty much every derogatory remark ever made about them is true--she's an inflated, room-temperature-IQ airhead (although she seems to have a bit more on the ball than he does, which should give you an idea of just how much of a wackjob he is) and he's a conceited, arrogant, obnoxious, bullying jackass. It's fairly evident from the start that Pam really didn't want to have sex on camera, but Tommy's constant badgering and whining finally made her give in. It's also evident--and pretty much confirmed near the end of this mess--that Tommy saw this more as a showcase for his sexual ""prowess"" than anything else, and it's also obvious that he really didn't give a rat's ass if Pam liked it or not. She doesn't really seem to be into it in the least. She reminds you of nothing more then a typical bored porn queen, just lying back and reciting, ""Oh yeah, baby, do me, you're great baby,"" blah, blah, blah. It's only at the end that you realize who was manipulating who: Tommy's preening, his smug, self-satisfied smirking, his ""Yeah, I'm the man!"" attitude contrasts with Pam's bemused ""OK, now that that's over, I can get back to doing something I actually enjoy"" expression.Don't get me wrong--even if Pam & Tommy Lee had a professional cinematographer shoot this it would still be worthless, because what you're seeing isn't a sex film as much as it is Tommy Lee's tribute to himself (and a pathetically undeserved one at that; his ""performance"" would get him laughed off the set of an actual porn film). Don't waste your time or your money on this loser.",-1
3,"Rented the movie because of all the hype surrounding it. Looked just like the kind of videos a vacationing couple would make on a trip, except this has too much of what you don't want others to see - sex. And the sex wasn't fantastic as well - I know this wasn't meant to be shown to the public. Pretty boring once you got past all the sex and their frolicking...Ever enjoyed watching your neighbours' home movies of their vacations? Thought not.",-1
1,"It's hard to review a tape that was never meant for public consumption. Neither Pamela Anderson nor Tommy Lee filmed this with the intent of releasing it to video -- although there are rumors to the opposite.I rented this during a dull weekend just for curiosity's sake -- thanks to all the media hype. It succeeded in making my weekend even duller.The gist of the matter is the sex takes up at most five minutes of the tape -- unless you get the truncated R-rated version where it's more like 30 seconds. The rest of the video consists of various home movie material -- the only difference between this and other people's home movies is it features two well-known people. Otherwise it's very dull stuff.Only a couple of moments stand out as interesting: the extremely poorly shot wedding footage (word to self: never point a video camera at people standing in front of the sun) which had an otherworldly feel to it, and a brief bit shot behind-the-scenes of Anderson's film Barb Wire.If you're in love with Anderson, you'll probably enjoy the tape. If you're renting this to see two celebrities having sex, you might get what you paid for, but don't expect much. Reportedly a much better ""naughty home video"" of Anderson exists, showing her having her jollies with Bret Michaels. Unfortunately (or fortunately), Anderson won a court case in the spring of 2001 that prevented this video from being released. Too bad she didn't have the same luck with her Tommy Lee opus.",-1
4,"A cinematic triumph. Pamela and Tommy Lee's Sex Video, supposedly stolen from the newlyweds' house, is nothing but buoyant fun. Pamela Anderson Lee, the internationally lusted-after Baywatch star, is positively unsinkable as she frolics in the buff off the Lees' Jacuzzi-equipped pleasure cruiser. Speaking of pleasure cruisers, Tommy's is cinema's real Titanic, although in this case it never founders. (Tommy Lee first made his name -- for what it's worth -- in the brainless 80s teen-rock band Motley Cru. You can certainly see where he got his self-confidence.)Even Pamela's famously plasticized accessories don't ring a false note. Who's to say what's real; they show up on videotape, right? Besides, there's no faking dialogue like:Pamela: ""Where's my cocktail?""Tommy: ""It's right here, baby."" (he pans downward) It's too bad the happy couple's dissolute pleasures are marred by excessive expressions of love and devotion.""You're the best f---ing husband in the world!"" Pamela squeals. Other than that bit of sentimentality, this is forty-five minutes worth of premium Americana -- show-biz success enjoyed the way God intended it: in a four-wheel-drive truck, rocking its shocks to pieces in the breakdown lane of the I-5.(Note: If IMDb doesn't want certain words included in reviews, even when those words are actual quotations from the film, then perhaps IMDb should not include films that contain such nasty words in its database.)",-1
3,"I don't see how anyone who sees this movie can seriously rate it a 10!  It was way too short on Pamela, and showed practically nothing interesting except for the scenery of Lake Mead.  It made me far more angry than aroused, and I don't think you could pay me to sit through it again.  Put it on at your party if you want everyone to leave!",-1
4,"The sexy side of this video caught my attention, but upon closer examination I noticed how revealing this home video sequence was and how normal these ""Pop Icons"" are.  There is explicit sex and nudity but it is brief or barely distinguishable.  The jittery hand held camera work or blurred lens will drive you nuts.  It took the couple a few days before they realized the camera lens was filthy.  Behind the scenes Pam seems more like a sweet modest girl than the sex pot her image portrays.  They live in luxury and freedom and this gives you a peak at ""how the other half lives"".  I reviewed the version with ""numerous scenes restored"".  But this may well have translated into many long, and boring sequences like their ""Alien Wedding"" where the bride and groom and various guests wear tin foil and spacesuits. The video reveals some wild and drunken behavior but also reveals two people that seem like fairly typical young adults that are in love.  They certainly never intended for this to be seen by the public, and their private craziness may not be too far from the lives of others of their age.  I would certainly pass on this one unless you are really thrilled by the voyeuristic aspects of it all.  The technical quality of the video is the lowest I've seen.",-1
1,"The reason I saw this film is that I just learned there is a celebrity named Pamela Anderson in the TV series ""Stacked"". And she is kind of sexy and charming. Therefore, curiosity kills the cat. Basically, from this film, I can have a peek of the life of the rich or the celebrity.Yeah, they can have fancy vacation and consume illegal drugs freely or so on. It is almost certain for me that the shooter of this film, either Pam or Tommy, was in a HIGH state. That should explains the shattered scenes and blurred out-of-focus views. The main attraction, the sex scene, is not at all exciting. You can't expect people to be impressed by some kind of large penis and shaved pussy. Come on, those Private stars can do more than these. Besides, there are only ordinary sex and oral sex. No orgy, no facial, no anal. Just boring. Too many F words in their daily conversations. So little real communication between these two newly married people. It is more like a reality show than a real honeymoon. It is not surprising at all, that their marriage did not last long although two kids were born. They are just two bored-to-earth person in this poor quality film. *Enough for the celebrity garbages.",-1
7,"I have watched this movie many times, and I think, despite the lack of characters and story line, this movie was decently done. I guess the biggest improvement this movie could make was to clean the dirty lens. Half the time the shots were blurry and the camera was shaking around. A major downside of this movie was the lack of emotion. I felt as emotional as I would watching paint dry. For a two-person made movie, however, I feel they did a decent job.Overall Opinion: If you can find it for a decent price, get it. Otherwise, it isn't worth your time.",1

The latter plays a man on a mission of revenge and gets sadly little screen time, but he does light up the screen whenever he appears.

10,"Bay Area educators and community folks volunteered and appeared in this student film that was meant to be for a class project at SFSU - 10 minutes was the requested project amount from the instructor. Well, the film-makers ended up making one of best intro to BDSM documentary movies that I have ever seen in my many years in this lifestyle. The film quality, lighting, editing and artistic approach quite exceptional. It is a great film for educators, mental health professionals, and other sex-educators. It is offers a sex-positive approach which takes the Newbie step-by-step in a PG-13 manner. The film has been on the film festival circuit and receiving rave reviews.This film is a classic and very much needed as an education tool. Every University and college that has a ethnic studies, social justice, counseling, psychology, and sociology departments should have this as part of their teaching tool presentation. All medical school should have this so that doctors can deal with a variety of lifestyles in a healthy manner. This will reduce the stigma and also redefine the various pathologies that are in the DSM-IV-TR books (American Psychology Association).If general, people should be exposed to various orientation and lifestyle that they are not familiar with. This one offers the real deal ( not from a research point of view) the people and educators involved in the topic of BDSM/Fetish/Kinky, alternative loving and adult play..About the documentary Quoted from their website: ""Topics of pain, abuse, stereotypes, race and community are broached in BDSM: Its Not What You Think! Mixing interviews, dramatizations and archival footage, this funny and educational film picks the brains of various Bay Area kinksters in order to debunk some of the myths surrounding BDSM play.""

9,"The first thing to note is the number of esteemed personalities involved in the film. Sybil Holiday, Janet Hardy and Nova & Atticus (of the Fetish Flame podcast) are just a few of those that shared their thoughts and experiences to this wonderfully informative and insightful film.Abuse, pain, slavery, feminism and more are touched on in this all too short documentary. This film explores the most often misunderstood aspects of what BDSM entails. It should be noted also that the term ""BDSM"" is used to reference all aspects of the community in the film. Whether you are Leather, Kink or Fetish and do not consider yourself a part of the BDSM community, this film addresses common questions and misunderstandings faced in all of the above lifestyles.While the film is short in length it is far from short on how relevant it is. Every question I have personally ever been asked or had myself is covered in the discussions that take place in the short 30 minutes. Of course this is not meant to answer all questions directed at someone in the BDSM lifestyle, that is a task no DVD is up to, it does cover the most important (safety, consent, abuse) and most frequent (who, why, what).Straight and to the point without a wasted moment, ""BDSM: It's Not What You Think!"" continues to be the best video resource for getting someone comfortable with the BDSM lifestyle, in my opinion. Wonderfully directed, unscripted answers to important questions and a wealth of information, this film is a must have for every household that wants to be understood and accepted by people close to them that question what BDSM is all about.My personal 3 favorite points in the film are: Janet Hardy's observation that people that love spicy food may be more kinky than they know, Janet Hardy's discussion on negotiations and the final scene; which ties together the entire intent of the film and adds the fun component.",1

It's tasteful, funny, well-informed and researched, based in experiential learning, and does not fall into the trap that so many films about sexuality and kink fall into - tokenism and exoticism. It is respectful of the bdsm community and gives novices a good taste of what safe, sane, consensual bdsm and kink are. My only complaint is that it is too short - I would have loved a full length hour version, I am sure there is enough material to fill that space. Thanks for the film!",1

They both have good reasons for being mad at each other - Ralph is a made guy, so he couldn't get hit just like that, but then again he totally crossed the line with Tracee - however circumstances dictate that a peaceful solution be found: firstly, their struggle might damage business with New York, which is why Johnny Sack urges Ralphie to apologize; secondly, one of Tony's captains suffers a fatal heart attack (sitting on the toilet, in case you were wondering), and there is only one person who seems to deserve a promotion. Clue: it ain't Paulie or Sil...In addition, He Is Risen opens up a new, risky path by having Meadow Soprano embark on a relationship with Jackie Aprile Jr. (Jason Cerbone). That kind of thing can't and won't end well, and the teleplay uses that blossoming romance well to contrast with the increasing hatred between the two lovers' ""fathers"" (Ralph is sleeping with Jackie's mom), but since there are still five shows to go all the cute stuff is kept to a minimum, the real core of the story being the metaphorical showdown between the boss and his hot-tempered captain. In the end it boils down to a duel between Gandolfini and Pantoliano, an old-school confrontation, involving two great thespians, to see who's the biggest bad-ass. Result: almost a tie, but eventually there's no doubt - good old Tony prevails, no matter what.",1
7,"Tony and Ralphie are at odds since Ralpie killed the stripper and Tony beat him in retaliation. Fearing a potential NYC/NJ gang skirmish, Johnny Sack convinces the crazier-than-ever Ralphie to apologize to Tony. In the middle of all this, a captain kicks the bucket Elvis-style and Tony ends up very reluctantly making Ralphie a captain. Ralphie meanwhile still talks about whacking Tony. Meadows gets it on with Jackie Jr, but manages to land herself in a world of hurt when she steals Jackie's car in a fit of pique. The tense interplay between Gandolfini and Joey P. is what makes the episode sing. Anything else in the episode is strictly filler.",1

And what happened in the first vs what happened in the end !Every thing what tony would to be .I like the scene in the restaurant between thim.And i like Mercedes tooo",1
2,"'Tycus' is almost as bad as a science fiction film can go.I can hardly find something good to say about this film. The premises are completely wrong. A comet is supposed to hit the Moon and cause catastrophic damage to Earth, but nobody believes the scientist who predicts this.A whole underground city plus a launching pad for nuclear armed rockets is build in the California mountains without anybody noticing. When the comet nears Earth the news make it to the TV and newspapers hardly a day before the event. And so on, and so on ...Neither does any kind of emotion make it to the screen. Is the genius who discovers the comet and builds the underground city a savior of humanity or a beast? The director or Dennis Hooper who is playing the role did not seem to decide until the film was done, and actually it does not make any difference because acting and directing is so confusing that you end by wondering what does this film try to say. The special effects are so cheap that not only that they cannot be convincing in the era of computer effects, but they could not have been convincing even in the 50s, four decades before this film was made.A total waste of time.",-1
1,"This movie is a science fiction about an asteroid hitting the moon and it's aftermath.The movie is one of the worst movie I have ever seen and this movie is bad in all the departments be it acting, direction, screenplay or script.The best thing is to ignore the movie",-1
5,"Not another ""comet hits the earth"" movie I hear you say.  Well, it's going to hit the moon, so I suppose it's slightly different this time.Dennis Hopper is probably the best actor on the planet at playing an egotistical maniac, and as the scientist building his ark in this film he does it well as ever.However, it's predictable and it's boring.  So don't see it!",-1
1,"Peter Crawford discovers a comet on a collision course with the moon. But when the government doesn't believe him (dumb fact #1). He builds a shelter in deep underground and is drawing lots to see who will go. Plus is willing to kill to save humanity (dumb fact #2). With millions of dollars of technology, how could a civilian see what NASA could not? Plus, the ends justifies the means moral of this story is just plain WRONG!!! This movie is improbable and totally unbelievable. What was running through these people minds, why the hell do crap piles like this get the green light? Some times I wonder who someone has to **** to get a movie made in this ****ing town.",-1
1,"Like many others, I counted on the appearance of Dennis Hopper to make this not a complete waste of time. I was sadly mistaken. Everything negative said about this flic is more than true. What takes the cake however, is the horrible, horrible storyline for the main character.Here's why: The planet might be destroyed, the ONLY way to recover from it, for the ENTIRE human race to be saved trough it, is to get as many smart, capable, nice, competent people into an underground hide-out. And Dennis Hopper is the lone seer/scientist with vision who was prepared for the worst, and who has realized this. But what's the main motivation of Stevens (Sonny D'Angelo)?? He's angry because Dennis has decided who is to be saved or to be doomed! While it clearly explained to Stevens that Dennis' character has done everything to warn people of the danger but that he was laughed at. The Hopper-character was the boy with the finger in the dike, and now Stevens is blaming him for 'picking and choosing'??? And if that isn't enough, he wants to stop everybody from entering this hideout, because ""it isn't fair!?"" AND.... he's responsible for the death of the one guy who is humanity's saviour! OH MY GOD, how stupid can you get?What's also maddening that IMDb forces one to write minimal ten lines about this piece of crap. I mean, TWO MILLION in budget, what could have been done with that? Think Clerks, Blair Witch, and lotsa other movies who have been made for under 100.000 dollars and were still better. AAAAARGH! I count myself lucky that I didn't pay one penny to see this crap, and to sit through the end of this utter, úber-crap, is one the most heroic things I've done this year. It's no wonder that the writers of this pile of dung had jobs as camera operator and title designer before ...",-1
2,"Unimpressive and extremely low budget sci-fi without any charm and appeal. Even the scenes related with the fall of the asteroids are stolen from other movies with the same plot. It's just a bad rip-off of ""Asteroid"" (with Annabela Sciora) and ""Deep Impact"" (with Morgan Freeman). Mr. Hopper seems to be anxious to slip away from this pointless and dull sci-fi entry.I give this a 2 (two). And don't say I'm not a good guy!",-1
3,"Oh, boy, it's another comet-hitting-the-earth film. Coming within a year or two of Deep Impact, Armageddon, Space Cowboys and various other stupid flicks with rap stars in them, you'd think people would be burned out on this concept. Apparently not, since I rented it, hoping it MIGHT not be awful: Dennis Hopper was in it, after all, and he's a good actor, right?I forgot something important: along with Peter O'Toole, Robert De Niro  and quite a few other esteemed actors, Hopper has a penchant for appearing in dreadful films. Not only that, but he seems to prepare for them by taking forget-how-to-act classes. His performance in Tychus is so awful that you expect Divine or Edith Massey to appear in some scenes.
I don't know what else to say about this rubbish, other than if you're into things crashing into the earth films, watch Deep Impact, and then Armageddon and Space Cowboys at a stretch. Forget the others altogether. This one really is bottom of the pile.",-1
1,"That's what one of the technicians who was tracking the asteroid shouted. Even though the asteroid was still behind the moon, on its collision course.Well, O.K. But I would think a movie script writer who flunked out of elementary school would know differently -- even on a low-budget $2 million movie.And then, when they launched the rocket inside the secret underground complex, it was in plain unobstructed view of the launch control panel and technicians. But there was no blow-back from the engines, which should have incinerated everybody.And the rocket engines were running the entire time from the Earth to the asteroid behind the moon.NASA would love to know how they did both.When the hero parachuted down to the area of the underground secret hideaway, the pilot was flying at only a few hundred feet to avoid radar in a remote mountain range, or so he said there was radar in the wilderness. So, the hero parachuted. He should have bounced two or three times before the parachute opened.And when the hero was in another gunfight with just about everybody, we knew he was out of ammo when he kept pulling the trigger on his automatic, and we heard ""click, click."" Automatics don't go ""click, click"" when they're out.When Hopper was asked how he was able to build a secret underground complex at a cost of several hundred million dollars, and get a rocket with a nuclear warhead, he simply said something along the lines that he avoided the government bureaucracy.Near the end, when Dennis Hopper and the main characters and their families approached the entrance to the elevator shaft leading to the sanctuary, there were around 40 ""extras"" who found the entrance and were waiting for something to happen. They all knew they were about to die.Hopper & company calmly approached the entrance. The ""extras"" did nothing but look. Maybe just one had a comment, but that's it. Hopper pulled out his remote and keyed in the code to open the elevator doors. The ""extras"" did nothing. Hopper & company got aboard and said their final lines. Only when the elevator doors began to close did the ""extras"" ran amok and rushed the doors to save themselves. Oh, get REAL! And at the end, there's a distant future peaceful Earth, with the storyteller telling the children how all this happened long ago, with a space view of the earth now surrounded with fragments of the moon.Well, without the moon, there goes the tides, which is how the oceans clean themselves. But that doesn't seem to matter to the plot line.And the list goes on.The storyline itself is just plain awful. Dennis Hopper, a fine and gifted actor, just must have had an overdue yacht payment to make, to get involved in this disaster of a disaster movie.This movie is ONLY worth watching if you're having a rotten day, and want to see something much worse to lift your spirits.",-1
2,Tycus is one of the worst films direct to video films that I see ever.I am not amazing that this product does not appearing at the cinema.Bad Visual effects (The start is dreadful)Bad actors (I don´t understand Why appear in this film the great Dennis Hopper)and Bad screen Without sense.My alternative:Armaggedon or Twister. SENTENCE FOR TYCUS:Do not watch this film.,-1
1,"Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. My lifetime was drastically wasted by this pile of stink. I would rather chew off my arm than watch this film again. Painful story line, painful characters and a painful two hours.The best way of describing this movie is a follows:- I would rather stick pins in my eyes and cut out my brain than watch another minute of this tripe.Advice is to stay well clear and let your local dustman do you a favour of removing this rubbish.Lin, you told me this was good!!!!Goodaleebyeload.",-1
7,"A £3.50 DVD can be a gamble and this was one that sort of paid off.A decent Saturday Night type movie that entertains if you gloss over the obvious plot flaws. Special effects are a bit few and far between with some repetition (and why does London always look as if it's in the 60's ?)If it had the budget of, say, Armageddon then I'm sure it would have performed better at the Box Office as the story is quite a good one.Overall, Tycus is consigned to B movie history but if you see it for £3.50 then it's worth buying.",1
5,"One must place aside the core of the story with the confines of the security mine in order to save a certain amount of people from the catastrophe yet to accur shorty in the chapter of their lives. We must, therefore, concentrate on the comet impact from striking the moon and delivering its payload of death on the earth. I wish to remark on the special affects on buildings and surroundings with the most horrifying devastation to humankind . If such a demonic occurrence from the cosmic depths actually happened, and I most certainly believe that it will, then the film, Tycus, will be excepted as a valuable asset to our knowledge.",-1
9,"Fans of apocalyptic movies will savor this well-made low-budget thriller that is essentially a remake of the 1951 George Pal classic ""When Worlds Collide."" A comet is headed for a near-collision with earth, and when his fellow scientists disregard his warnings of doom, eccentric scientist Peter Crawford (Dennis Hopper) gathers a group of private investors to secretly construct an underground sanctuary.The story unfolds through the eyes of muscle-bound Gulf-war veteran Jake Lowe (Peter Onorati)who inadvertently discovers Crawford's hidden sanctuary and then decides that Crawford is wrong for keeping his project hidden from the rest of humanity. As the comet approaches, the subject of who should live and who should die makes for interesting drama.While the special effects are not in the same league, I enjoyed the story more than I did Spielberg's War of the Worlds, because I feel this screenplay is better. Some suspension of scientific reality is required, but it's worthwhile for the development of a good story. I highly recommend this film to fans of the genre.",1
2,"I actually enjoyed Tycus, if not for much more than mocking the production values. Dennis Hopper was just fine, although I wonder if he would have signed on the project had he seen the special effects they used. And furthermore, what was with the scene with the ninja?? That was just completely out of pace. Perhaps someone came up with the bright idea mid-shooting. Oh well, This movie is great if you're drunk and need a good laugh. Cheers.",-1
3,"I have read all of the reviews for this direct to video movie. I can agree that the movie is not ""Armageddon"" or ""Deep Impact"" quality. Nevertheless, if you are looking for a way to pass ninety minutes or so, then this is a movie that is bearable.I started looking at the film early in the AM hours as I was doing some geek stuff. It was very nice, because I was able to switch back and forth between what I was doing and watching the movie, with out missing a beat. It is a predictable movie, and the acting is not up to par for some of the veteran actors (for instance, Dennis Hopper).But I should point out that I paid only $2 (US) and as the old adage goes: You get what you pay for! If you are looking for some deep meaning movie that will have you have to watching it over and over again, then this is definitely the long video. On the other hand, if you looking for something to pass the time, then there is nothing wrong with Tycus (Which incidentally was called ""Comet: Final Impact"" in Mexico where I found this video).",-1
10,"For a movie shot in 18 days and a budget less than 2 million, this little movie that could deserves a 'best we could' award.  Interesting premise (aside from the usual meteor stuff) with solid perfs by a cast of familiar faces.  2 thumbs up.  Advice to the other reviewer: Don't be afraid to say you liked something.",1
5,"Basic fun movie but don't go expecting to see great effects, great acting and a great story. The special effects are OK but not very realistic. The acting is OK but nothing special. The story is OK but predictable. All in all, an OK movie if you have a few hours to spare with nothing better to do.",-1
1,"Not only did the effects and acting in this movie bite, but the story was terrible.A scientist discovers that a comet fragment will hit the moon ... world leaders ignore him ... he builds a shelter ... then, everyone is upset that he is ""playing God"".How lame!  He built the thing, why is everyone ""entitled"" to access? Totally lame story, don't waste your time!",-1
3,"It's certainly a direct-to-video, but the story is not as bad as most of the other reviewers think. I quite like the fact the hero is doing the wrong thing most of the time.The hero's reactions and the reactions of the rebels are just human. The Hopper character is actually playing god. That might be the right thing to do, but one may not like that anyway.In the end, the god player is doomed to death, and the hero, who would have spent his own life, can live. Quite a morale. :-)The most unrealistic thing I saw, is that earth is doing so well with no moon stabilizing its rotation.",-1
5,"I just finished watching this two-part Australian mini-series about that '80s pop sensation known as ""INXS"", and while I liked a lot about it, I thought a lot about it fell a bit flat. I'm on the fence on this one overall. I mean I liked the actors who played the band members, and I liked the fact they used real INXS music. I HATE it when they make a rock biopic and the musician in question did not give consent to use the original music, so they end up using knockoff versions- that really bugs me. I was never a big fan of the group I must admit. I ""think"" i had their '85 LP (on audio-cassette!), ""Listen Like Thieves"", but other than that I recall their huge album ""Kick"", which came out around '87 I think-??- which spawned several hit singles. I do think though the film really down-played Hutchence's disorder- the idea of not being able to smell or taste food anymore (and I think his sex drive was affected as well-??)-?? I remember in my last year of college hearing about his late wife talking about how bad he had taken it all right after his suicide was aired all over the world media. But yeah, if you were a big fan of this group, I'd say check it out sometime, other than that, I would probably go catch any one of the other 1000 rock biopics out there. In fact, one I would recommend over this one, if you haven't seen it already, was the 2001 made-for-VH1 biopic about Def Leppard called ""Hysteria"", a much more absorbing piece IMHO...",-1
8,"The story behind the phenomenon that was INXS is certainly fascinating, particularly given their basic beginnings in a country that produces many great bands, but few that can reach such heights such as the Farriss Brothers and co. managed to ascend in the 1980's. Without going into any sort of plot detail, as it merely follows the band's journey, it does bring home a few interesting points. Having a charismatic front man unquestionably contributed to their success, but was not the sole reason behind it. It was the songs, consistently good, in most cases great, over many years. Most bands have a good album or two in them, few can brag as many as INXS did with a killer run, particularly with The Swing, Listen Like Thieves and Kick back to back.The other thing that is apparent is how much luck is a factor. Timing was crucial, as is the incredible hard work necessary. The Beatles perfected their live shows in Hamburg while INXS did it all throughout Australia in a similar fashion. Never Tear Us Apart also shows how much the diligence of Manager Chris Murphy got them to where they were. He apparently got a good deal but he was worth it. Others have noted how success is hard work, talent and luck and it's the case here. With middle age businessman running the show, you wonder how many accomplished bands have been overlooked (too many to name but Starky and Fourth Floor Collapse being recent-ish Australian examples).The actors do a great job, mostly not just looking the part, but sounding like their real life counterparts. I especially enjoyed Andrew Ryan and Ryan Johnson but you couldn't ask for a better Michael Hutchence than in Luke Arnold. Across the board, he's done a wonderful job. (Caught a glimpse of Kirk Pengilly in a cameo. Any more in there?)If there is any criticism it's the presence of the actual band hovering over the production. You get the feeling they wanted everyone to know how much of a good time they had rather than showing anything too negative. (No drug fallouts?) Plenty of that to come in Part Two no doubt. It's a lot of fun though and they narrow in on the humour. (No mention of Michael's extraordinary Dogs in Space role). The series is successful as it leaves you wanting more, not less, always a good thing in any drama. Though it's played fairly safe there is a healthy dose of archival footage, complete with actual vox pox which gives you a real insight into the feelings and opinions of the youth of the day, rather than simple crowd shots of Wembley. It's all woven together seamlessly and lovingly, no doubt sparking off a huge re- interest in a band who really do belong up there in the collective memory as one of the best pop/rock bands of all time. Ending the way they did, they were never able to fade away that lingering bands do, thus ensuring their longevity. Let's hope this series solidifies their rightful place in history so that millions more can enjoy their music in the years to come.",1
10,"Daina Reid who was also an actress in another classic flick, Love and Other Catastrophes has created a gem in Never Tear Us Apart: The Untold Story of INXS.Starring Luke Arnold who has been in another classic mini-series, The Pacific 2010, Black Sails 2014-17 and another classic flick, The Tunnel 2011.Also starring Damon Herriman who has also been other classic flicks, 100 Bloody Acres 2012, House of Wax 2005 and Praise 1998.I enjoyed the music and the warts and all story about the bands rise and fall.If you enjoyed this as much as I did then check out other classic mini-series, Dead Set 2008, Generation Kill 2008, Spartacus: Gods of the Arena 2011, The Pillars of the Earth 2010, The Incredible Journey of Mary Bryant 2005, The Night Of 2016, The Slap 2011, The Beautiful Lie 2015, Blue Murder: Killer Cop 2017, The State 2017, The Long Road Home 2017, Banished 2015, Blue Murder 1995, Underbelly Files: Chopper 2018, Chernobyl 2019 and Band of Brothers 2001.",1
10,The people have put bad reviews want the moon on a stick or they just expect the world to be there purely for them!!!!This is a really good portrayal of INXS and Luke Arnold is simply superb.,1
9,"INXS are arguably Australia's greatest music export. As such they hold a special place in the nation's psyche. Many Australian's can tell you exactly where they were when the news of Michael Hutchence' death was made public. So you can imagine that any film or television depiction of the band would have to be made with this at the fore front of the producers' minds.This is particularly true of those, such as myself, who grew up in the 80's, bought their albums, and saw them live when they were at their peak. I still consider the 'Australian Made' concert that I attended in January of 1987, to be probably the best I have seen. INXS headlined the show, as at that time they were the biggest act in Australia. Later that year they would release 'Kick', and become for a while, 'the biggest band in the world'.The show was promoted very heavily. Radio stations were playing INXS specials, Toyota started a new national advertising campaign using 'New Sensation' as the theme, and there were articles about the show and the band throughout the media.So did it live up to the hype? The answer is a resounding yes! Never Tear Us Apart: The Untold Story of INXS part one deals with the early years of INXS, up until, and just after the release of 'Kick' – their most successful album in 1987. Although a long-time fan, the show shed light on much I did not know about the band, particularly when it came to Chris Murphy - their manager.The show kicks off (pardon the pun) with INXS playing in front of a sold out crowd at Wembley Stadium in 1991. Footage from 'Live Baby Live' is interspersed with the actors, which perhaps surprisingly works extremely well.This leads into an interview with Tim Farriss played by Nick Masters talking about the Wembley gig, adding that it wasn't always this way. This interview is the introduction to the story which then goes back to 1979, when INXS were still the Farriss Brothers, and living in Perth.This technique, of an interview with a band member leading into another part of the story is used throughout the show, and works well. It allows for time to be skipped and shifted without confusing the viewer, even if they are unaware of the history of the band.The story then shifts to the bands' early years in Sydney, where they get their first manager in Gary Morris, and release their first album. After Morris becomes a born again Christian he introduces the band to Chris Murphy, who, after meeting them decides to give up a lucrative business to manage INXS full time.The remainder of Part One deals with the rise and rise of INXS, the extent they had to go to, and the risks Murphy was willing to take to make INXS 'the biggest band in the world'.Part two covers the later years of INXS, mostly concentrating on Michael Hutchence - his increasing isolation from the band, and the downward spiral he finds himself in after being assaulted by a cab driver.The final scenes depicting Hutchence's death are handled sensitively and extremely well. The day after Part Two was screened, message boards in Australia were filled with comments about how emotionally powerful these scenes were, and how they brought back the same feelings of grief, and or emptiness that were felt 15 odd years ago.Never Tear Us Apart: The Untold Story of INXS is fascinating viewing. The script is very solid, and the production values are high. It is very well directed by Daina Reid (Paper Giants: The birth of Cleo, and Howzat: The Kerry Packer Story), and as has already been mentioned, the use of archive footage interspersed throughout is done extremely well.The cast do an amazing job, particularly Damon Herriman (Justified, Vegas), who plays Chris Murphy, and Luke Arnold (Black Sails, Winners and Losers), is absolutely outstanding - in the most difficult role given the circumstances - as Michael Hutchence.And of course if you are an INXS fan the soundtrack is fantastic.I cannot recommend Never Tear Us Apart: The Untold Story of INXS highly enough, even if you are not a fan of the band. Perhaps the only negative I can say about it is that if, like me you grew up in the eighties, you will sadly be reminded of the amazingly horrendous fashion of what was otherwise an awesome decade.9/10",1
6,"I found this really enjoyable! Luke Arnold did a great job at channeling Michael's down to earth, gentle qualities, and the boy who played younger Michael did some brilliant scenes, though little words spoken, he really was very well cast with his demeanor and looks. I thought the actress playing Kylie in this was absolutely SPOT ON and seeing the blossoming love story between Michelle and Michael, Kylie and Michael and Andrew and his wife were all really sweet scenes. The guy who plays Andrew Farriss is in my opinion uncanny... amazing casting again. My favourite scene was when the band was just about to 'make it', when they heard Simple Simon come on the radio in the van. I thought that little scene accurately captured the beautiful, heady atmosphere of the time right before a band becomes famous, which many musicians will tell you is the best time of their career. 
 
Some of the extras cast were a little tackily presented/dressed. It wasn't quite true to the utter coolness of the underground 80's aesthetic that was going on in Melbourne and Sydney and many extras or smaller roles came across as more mainstream American-80's style in their dress sense and such.Lastly I will just say, I'm not sure how accurate it all is, and unless you were there we will never know. I'm sure that biopics like this are really difficult and touchy to watch for people close to the matter, especially family and such. But as a celebrating the public life of Michael and INXS, I think this is a really decent production which I would really enjoy seeing again and again.",1
9,"The brilliant display of talent, both of screenplay and writing was matched eloquently with the life of famous rock band INXS.In particular, it was refreshing to see a balance between the stories of the other band members entwined with the history of Michael Hutchence. The story was well considerate of all aspects of the bands rise to fame, and perfectly incorporated them into an intricate web of unmissable scenes that give the film substance and fluidity.In addition, Luke Arnold (as Michael Hutchence)was so convincing, it became difficult to separate him from the real thing. Samantha Jade (as Kylie Minogue) was another sensation to the cast, although not much in physical likeness to Kylie, her portrayal and vocal ability was remarkable. Jade was so professional in her portrayal that Kylie Minogue herself congratulated the young star (via Twitter) for her respectful depiction.A fantastic production worth watching again. Part 2 should be well worth the wait. 9 out of 10 stars.",1
9,"This movie shows the jourrney of INXS in a musical, comical, serious and touching way. From the careless beginning days to the massive succes and the tragic death of Michael. All the actors play their roll very well. One of the great additions in the movie is the fact that personal happenings get attention as well. That way you get an even better look inside the lifes of the member of the band and how the career of INXS came about.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1
8,"""Never Tear Us Apart: The Untold Story of INXS"" (2014)One of the greatest bands ever, and by far the best Aussie band, INXS changed music. But, every band goes through hard times. This two part TV/movie/miniseries is about the story of INXS. Straight up, this TV mini series is amazing. It will hook you from the first minute. And the splitting up into two parts is done surprisingly great. Part one is the band's start, and how successfully they become, and part two is about how it all came tumbling down. The acting is a highlight for this, especially Luke Arnold (The Tunnel) as Michael Hutchence. He played this role perfectly, almost Oscar worthy in my opinion. The rest of the cast played their roles exceptionally, Hugh Sheridan, Andrew Ryan, Alex Williams, Ido Drent, they all played their roles great. Samantha Jade played Kylie Minogue surprisingly well, and Damon Herriman felt like the real thing (as with the rest of the cast).This is easily the best live-action documentary with actors (is that what it's called?) that i have seen. See this when it comes out on BD and DVD. February 26 or 27 i believe it comes out. It easily gets a 9 out of ten.9/10 Review by Scarcey",1
6,"I get that they want to sensationalise the band, but what was really missing for me was the music.
They massively glossed over the bands biggest tour and barely acknowledged 'X' and 'Welcome To Wherever You Are'
Some of those songs stand the test of time but instead we get Paula Yates giving birth? Not for me.Worth a watch but I want more music!!",1
10,Loved and thoroughly enjoyed. Been waiting since I was a young girl for them to make a movie about INXS. Lucas Arnold did an amazing job as Michael. Totally cried at the end. :) Incorporating real footage was a brilliant idea. I loved watching the concert seen at the end. I thought all the actors did an wonderful job. It was nice to finally get an insight about the band and their beginning in Australia. I also noticed that a lot of this movie seemed like it was based on the INXS autobiography that came out a few years ago. I would definitely recommend this film to all INXS lovers. It truly makes you appreciate the band way more and everything they went through.,1
2,"I am really surprised at the high rating this is getting. The only redeeming thing about the show is the music, which of course is the work of the band INXS and not the work of the actors, writers and producers.Some of the acting is just awful. Ido Dent and Hugh Sherridan (John Fariss and Garry Gary Beers) is frighteningly bad and the scene where Michael's first serious partner ""Michelle"", is cringworthy.I'm a red blooded male but the ""T and A"" seems excessive to the story.In the end you realise the only reason you are watching is the music. I thought it was rather embarrassing for Australian TV.",-1
6,"I liked the band, and was eager to see the movie, which nevertheless turned out to be a bit soap-operaish. For a movie that went two parts, I left feeling like the whole story of the band hadn't been told. It was more like here are the big moments, First Big US Tour, Bang! Wembley, Bang! and at times it verged on being the Michael Hutchence Story.I know the band likes to play it up in their bio books, but I seriously doubt they were stealing Adam Ant's women. I was around for those shows back then, and believe me, for a while he was the biggest chick magnet going. Guess the guys feel compelled to create their own legends. Likewise I was amused at how the band apparently balked at opening for him, kind of arrogant considering they were nobodies then (at least in the U.S) and had a shot to play 5,000 seat arenas instead of 50 seat pubs. Still, I watched it once, I'd watch it again just for the music. This often replays late nights on cable, and it's a fun watch. Nice touch also including the acoustic ""Don't Change"" tribute version (if you haven't heard the original which also includes the haunting background vocals give it a listen.)",1
6,"Except for the beginning and end title sequences the song Feudin', Fussin', and A-Fightin' will not be heard at all in this western comedy with two musical numbers in it. The feud here involves a couple of western towns that have an annual footrace and one town has been running the pants off the other, so much so that with the money lost in bets, the town that Percy Kilbride and Marjorie Main reside in is practically in receivership to the other.So what to do, but try to find a fast runner even if it means kidnapping him. Which is what they do with traveling salesman Donald O'Connor. Of course later on Penny Edwards who is Marjorie's niece provides a more subtle inducement for him to stay.The film itself was created to take advantage of the hit song by Burton Lane and Al Dubin and popularized by Dorothy Shaye, billed as the Park Avenue hillbilly. She sings the song in the later Universal film with Abbott&Costello, Comin' Round the Mountain. It's a fun song and made Dorothy Shaye a one hit wonder in her time, but it was a big hit. I have a bootleg recording of it where she does a trio version with Bing Crosby and Groucho Marx on one of Crosby's radio broadcasts.The premise quite frankly is rather dopey, the best comedy in the film is provided by future stooge Joe Besser as the sheriff who condones kidnapping in his town for a good cause. But Donald O'Connor is given a couple of fine numbers. He sings and dances to Me And My Shadow in a nice number staged in barn. Very intricate almost Busby Berkely like in creativity. And he sings and dances with Penny Edwards to the song Sposin'.For those numbers which do show the ingenuity and talent of Donald O'Connor, I'd check out Feudin', Fussin', and A-Fightin'.",1
6,"""When I get a man, I want one that ain't afraid of anything, including me!"" So says boisterous Marjorie Main to her diminutive constant companion Percy Kilbride, in this, their follow-up to ""The Egg and I"", and a year before they started their series of ""Ma and Pa Kettle"" films. Here, they are residents of a small hayseed town searching for someone to represent them in the annual county race, and they find it in visiting salesman Donald O'Connor who literally just stepped off the stagecoach to make a pitch and step right back on. Fortunately, he misses the coach, and must run to get it, after which Main and Kilbride chase it to keep him in town to be their town representative in the race. Most of the film focuses on getting O'Connor ready for the race with various gags, and then comes the race, fast, furious and funny. Of course, O'Connor finds romance in the meantime with Main's niece (Penny Edwards) and performs a neat dance number to ""Me & My Shadow"" filled with special effects. Along with Edwards, O'Connor sings and dances to the sweet ""S'posin'"".This is a charming comedy made for the country folk that city slickers could enjoy too. Main and Kilbride make a cute couple. ""From now on, there's gonna be one person wearing pants in the family, and it ain't gonna be me"", Kilbride realizes at one point. O'Connor is one of those naively romantic heroes who could win the pretty girl just by his innocence over the more worldly hunk. It's all harmless fun. Some of the dance moves in ""Me and My Shadow"" O'Connor would later repeat in his famous ""Make Em' Laugh"" number in ""Singin' in the Rain"". The race sequence is very funny with some assistance for the hero thanks to some animal friends.",1

Cut to 70 minutes in Australia.SYNOPSIS: A slapstick comedy, with song and dance routines, about the annual foot race sponsored by two rival villages. Setting: the West, at the end of the 19th century. — Copyright summary.NOTES: Leonard Goldstein's inspired re-teaming of Marjorie Main with Percy Kilbride in an effort to cash in on their huge box-office success in ""The Egg and I"", was not seen as the potential bonanza by the Universal brass who didn't even bother to arrange a New York opening. In Sydney, the movie was booked as the Christmas attraction at Greater Union's third-string city cinema (after the State and the Lyceum), the Victory. In order to accommodate double-billing with ""The Saxon Charm"", it was cut from 78 to 70 minutes. To everyone's surprise, the movie proved a colossal hit, with Main and Kilbride eventually being advertised in larger letters than the film's actual star, Donald O'Connor. The ads linked Main and Kilbride as Ma and Pa Kettle of ""The Egg and I"". Despite its huge box-office take, you will not find this movie listed in any of the record books, because Universal split all receipts at least fifty-fifty and in some cases as much as ninety- ten in the film's disfavor. This amazing success was deliberately minimized because Marjorie Main was under contract to M-G-M. Formerly antipathetic, Universal executives were now ultra enthusiastic about a Kettle series, but if M-G-M got wind of just how much Main was really worth, her asking price would have risen at least 1,000%. COMMENT: Mild rustic comedy offering little more than passable entertainment. George Sherman's heavy-handed direction robs the script of whatever original sparkle it may have possessed. Were it not for the sterling efforts of Marjorie Main, Percy Kilbride and particularly Joe Besser, its entertainment potential would be even lower. Dance director Louis Da Pron has contributed one mildly imaginative touch with a shadow dance between Donald O'Connor and his alter ego, but the potentialities here are nowhere near fully realized. The title is a misnomer: the feud is limited to a foot-race, there is absolutely no fightin' and altogether too much fussin'.",1
9,"Maybe you didn't catch Don's(Wilber)spoof of Huey Long's 'share the wealth, every man a king, a chicken in every pot' political campaign of the '30s. Don substitutes a horse and a bottle of his snake oil hair tonic for Huey's promises in his acceptance speech, after having been unanimously decreed mayor of the tiny dusty hamlet of Rimrock, replacing restaurant owner Maribel(Marjorie Main)..This kidnapped former traveling salesman was awarded this honor for winning the annual Bench County marathon from its arch rival Big Bend, apparently the only two towns in this very sparsely populated county. Also, he was clearly knowledgeable of political history and legal matters(strange for a mere traveling salesman for snake oils).Universal reteamed Marjorie Main and Percy Kilbridge from the previous year's successful rural comedy ""The Egg and I"", with a new first-billed star:Donald O'Connor, and a new girlfriend for him in Penny Edwards, in a rural western romantic comedy. Universal would continue to pair Marjorie with Percy or his successors in a yearly series through '57, with future titles always beginning with Ma and Pa Kettle, resurrecting their character's names from ""The Egg and I"". In the present film, they are also essentially Ma and Pa Kettle in all but name, although they aren't officially married. Apparently, the decision to resurrect their Kettle identity wasn't made until after this film was finished.As another reviewer pointed out, Wilber's relationship with the horse Jasper, his 'roommate' in the town livery stable where Wilber was essentially incarcerated, looks like a precursor for Don's future popular series with Francis 'the talking mule'.This was my introduction to Penny Edwards(as Libby): a vivacious young blond with singing and dancing talent. She made winsome bait to help convince Wilber to stay a while in Rimrock and hopefully win the annual marathon for the town.(seems all the young men had left this dead end community!). Eventually, he takes the bait after considerable resistance against his captors.Their up and down relationship hits a high point when she follows him outside into a dark Main Street,following a low point at a party. She initiates a lengthy street song and dance routine with Wilber to the '20s hit ""Sposin"", demonstrating her excellent singing voice and stage dancing talent. She later engineered the stampede to have him replace her mother, Maribel, as town mayor, by spreading the rumor that rival Big Bend had offered him their mayorship. Penny was mostly cast in westerns, including the occasional musical comedy, in her Hollywood and TV careers, and was a popular TV pitch girl. Like Donald, seems like she should have had a much more prominent film career.Don(Wilber) has a lengthy dance sequence, including tap dancing, by himself,locked up in that livery stable, while singing the '20s hit ""Me and My Shadow"". At times, we see his inflated shadow dancing, and sometimes,clearly his shadow is dancing independently from Don's action. This spooks him, and he dives through the paper wall where his shadow is seen, foreshadowing his similar dive through the thin set wall in his notable solo ""Make 'Em Laugh""skit, in ""Singing in the Rain"".I disagree with several reviewers who say the humor in this film was flat, due to poor script and direction. We had a great primarily physical comedian in Don, and a great verbal comedian in Marjory, and they did their normal thing well. Actually, Don exhibited outstanding combined physical and verbal comedy in his failed attempt to interest the patrons of Maribel's restaurant in his hair tonic. His high point in physical comedy related to his marathon run, where he was barely conscious due to lack of sleep, staying up all night to tend his sick horse friend. He required the stimulus of a series of antagonistic animal encounters(rattlesnake, porcupine, skunk) to keep him interested in the race instead of sleeping, a chance reversal of a route arrow by a crow, and a topical dose of his hair tonic near the end to power him past his adversary at the last second: an extended slapstick performance worthy of Stan Laurel, Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Red Skelton or The Three Stooges, for example.Of course, the end result was quite predictable. Of course, the screen play is quite daffy, but that was normal for most musical comedies of this era. Burton Lane and Al Dubin composed the title song, heard at the beginning and end. One criticism I have is the title, which i feel suggested an unrealized level of violence and antagonism.""We Love Wilber"" would perhaps have been more appropriate, in line with Don's later MGM film: ""I Love Melvin"" You can currently view this film in its entirety on You Tube. I much enjoyed it and consider it one of Don's best post-Peggy Ryan films.",1
8,"Do you like musical comedies? Then this is your cup of tea. It has two really terrific musical entries. Donald O'Connor is a good dancer, but he is not particularly creative. Me and my shadow is terrific, but not entirely original.The plot has a lot of fluff. O'Connor plays the part of a fast talking salesman. He tries to sell his wares in a town of 275. When it's time to leave, Marjorie Main and Percy Kilbride see him run after a stagecoach. They desperately need someone to run against a good runner who is a resident of another nearby town. They arrest him. He meets a beautiful resident of the town, and that makes the place more appealing. There are many non essential threads that lead us away from the ""race"", but we are intended to be amused by all the going ons.Finally the day of the race arrives. O'Connor is not ready to race: he's been threatened by his girl friend's other boy friend, and he's been up all night baby sitting a sick horse.That essentially is the plot. The race itself is a variation on the story of the Tortoise and the Hare.It is a period piece: it is interesting as a part of the history of film, but one can watch much better films that O'Connor and Main and Kilbride have starred in. It is interesting to see once, but not worth more than a casual look when other better films are available.",1
5,"This is a very pleasant picture with a terrific cast. But it has one glaring problem - the comedy sequences are weak at best. D.D. Beauchamp wrote the story and screenplay. Beauchamp had previously written Universal's THE WISTFUL WIDOW OF WAGON GAP, but on that picture he had help from the excellent Bob Lees and Fred Rinaldo, as well as Abbott & Costello specialist John Grant. On FEUDIN', Beauchamp was all alone and the comedy sequences are flat as a pancake. In fact, the ""gimick"" that is employed in the race finale is also very weak. Nor was the director, George Sherman, particularly strong on comedy. His specialty was oaters (of which this is indeed one). The strength of the picture is to be found in the personalities of O'Connor, Main and Kilbride (not playing the Kettles). O'Connor's dance routines are a nice diversion and I'm sure nobody cared that ""Me and My Shadow"" was written long after this picture is supposed to take place. This could have been a very, very good picture if only there had been some comedy experts on the job. But Universal had recently changed hands and Messrs. Spitz and Goetz were miserly on their non-prestige products. Even Joe Besser has virtually nothing to do that exploited his many comic talents. If you enjoyed this picture, do yourself a favor and seek out THE WISTFUL WIDOW OF WAGON GAP. You'll have a really good time with that one.",-1
10,"I am a huge Donald O'Connor fan, and have seen most of movies.  This one however, is one of his best, right up there with ""Singin' in the Rain"" and ""Call Me Madam.""  This movie is about Wilbur McMurtry, played by O'Connor, and how he is kidnapped by a small western town, to run in their annual footrace.  It has two musical numbers, one being ""Me and My Shadow,"" a fast paced tap number, which has him dancing with shadows and running up walls, four years before he did in ""Singin' in the Rain.""  Then there is ""S'posin'"" which is more of a lyrical love song, where once again he shows his incredible dancing skills.  Not to mention that this movie is hilarious. Donald's comedic timing and physical comedy in this movie are outstanding, not to mention his dancing and singing, but that's no big surprise.  This movie is pretty hard to track down...it took me almost a year, but I would try getting a copy of it because it some of Donald O'Connor's best work, and is just an all-around great movie.  A hidden gem and a true musical treasure.",1
7,"I know not much should be expected in the way of story quality in this genera, but every film should be internally consistent. Shouldn't she-as-an-adult have remembered something of the visitation from the future-when-she-was-a-teen? The teen-she invites her future hubby up her ass...surely the adult-she would have remembered THAT! Back home after their adventure, she mentions having been had by both her dad and her mom...PLUS her own teen self...and I couldn't help but wonder why HE didn't get a shot at the mom, too. It would have been an obvious encounter to me.",1
10,"Ah, here we are in the glorious, notorious, mid-eighties incest porn boom. This film is one of the most innovative ones of the sub-genre. A small rundown of the scenes will help illustrate what I mean. Erica Boyer goes back in time, although it takes her a while to realize this. The first thing she does is hook up with a pretty young thing (Tammy White) and they have sex. In the next scene she realizes that this young woman she just slept with is a young version of herself! Well, wouldn't you know it. Next she meets her father as a young man and he basically performs oral sex on her until she finally stops objecting (on the grounds that it's incest and it's wrong) and starts enjoying it. From then on, she thinks everything must be a dream. Meanwhile, her husband (Randy West), the inventor of the time machine, has automatically recalled the machine and accidentally brought the young version of his wife forward through time. Needless to say, they have sex. Then we have a pointless ""normal"" sex scene with some friends of the family before finally getting to the real nitty-gritty: Erica has sex with her own mother (the amazing, unstoppable Sharon Mitchell.) This scene is so nasty, so energetic, it's nearly unprecedented in mother/daughter porn scenes. Definitely the highlight of the video. Then we have an orgy scene (never the high point of videos of this period,) before Erica and Randy go back to the future and reconcile by (guess what) having sex. An excellent porn film that's funny and really sexy. Worth seeing for the two lesbian scenes alone.",1
7,"Despite this being a circus film and I usually hate circus films, this one was pretty good. While it was far from perfect, the acting and writing were good. What I also liked was the seamless way the actors did the trapeze work. I realize some stunt people must have been used, but also know that Burt Lancaster was quite the athlete and was pretty competent on the trapeze, so the stunt-work was less extensive than it might have been with other actors. In some ways it seemed like a non-comedic version of the Crimson Pirate due to all the flips and tumbles. About the only short-coming, and it was minor, was that the romantic aspects of the film seemed to be the weakest link because the viewer ultimately KNOWS what MUST happen in the plot. But, it still somehow works out fine.",1
5,"In Trapeze Burt Lancaster finally realized an ambition to return to his roots as a circus acrobat and do a film under the big top. When he and Tony Curtis and Gina Lollobrigida are soaring through the air, Trapeze is a thing of beauty. Unfortunately on the ground it's firmly fixed to mediocrity with a very melodramatic triangle subplot.Lancaster plays a once promising aerial artist who perfected the triple somersault in the air. But doing it once too often shattered his career along with his leg. Lancaster now works as a rigger for Thomas Gomez's circus.But one day when young Tony Curtis, a would be Trapeze artist comes to the circus seeking out Lancaster, Burt recognizes the talent that is there after some initial misgivings. He agrees to become Curtis's catcher and teach him the tricks of Trapeze trade. What complicates things is goldigging Gina Lollobrigida a jack of all the circus trades who desperately wants to get to America. She's an old girl friend of Lancaster, but sees in Curtis her meal ticket. He's after all the one with the talent and the young reflexes. Lancaster's wise to her, but she does get the old hormones going in Burt.Seeing Lancaster doing his own trapeze stunts is quite a marvel, but in fact it was his old trade. I'm sure being the producer of Trapeze helped because if this had been a studio production the bean counters in the front office would have been going out of their minds at seeing their big star risking life and limb.Katy Jurado has a nice if somewhat undefined role as a bareback rider who also has an old time yen for Burt. Thomas Gomez is quite the schemer as the owner who naturally wants to keep the act intact and working for him and not going to a bigger show. That bigger show is Ringling Brothers,Barnum&Bailey circus in America and Minor Watson plays the real life John Ringling North.Unfortunately for Trapeze, Cecil B. DeMille's The Greatest Show On Earth set an impossible standard for circus pictures. Maybe if it had concentrated on the aerial and left the romance alone, Trapeze would be better thought of today.Next year Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis teamed for Sweet Smell of Success. Now that's the film the two will be better remembered by far.",-1
7,"Trapeze artist Mike Ribble (Burt Lancaster) has a bad fall and ends up with a bad leg. In Paris, Mike is working only as a rigger. Tino Orsini (Tony Curtis) has come from Brooklyn to train under him for the near-impossible triple somersault. He gets a job as a flier and convinces Mike to be his catcher. Ambitious Lola insinuates herself into the act and ends in a triangle.Burt returns to his former life and that's what I love the most about this movie. I love the physicality from both Lancaster and Curtis. The climatic performance is intense and perfectly staged. The main issue is the love triangle. It needs some cleaning up. I don't want Lola to talk to the owner about the act. She should simply inject herself into the act. That would keep the triangle purer. It gets a little messy. Overall, I love the real physical work and the triangle at its cleanest.",1
7,"A stranger came to my door one night to give me mail that had been misdelivered. He was wearing a jacket with a circus logo and when I asked what he did he said he'd been part of a trapeze act. ""Catcher or flier?"" A flier, he replied, and left without further comment. That isn't what I expected at all. I wanted him to ask how the hell I knew the difference. If he HAD asked I would have said I learned it from this movie.Had he pursued the matter I would have asked him questions like which was more difficult, the ""bird's nest"" or the simple ""pirouette"". I was dying to show off but never got the chance. Well, we probably wouldn't have become friends anyway. I hate self-contained people. Most are snooty.I wish some night a geometrician would bring me some misdelivered mail, though, since I can't understand how the word ""trapeze"" comes from the Latin ""trapezium"" and ""trapezoid"" because I learned in high school that a trapezoid was a two dimensional figure with no parallel sides, like a befouled rectangle, whereas a ""trapeze"", well, it cuts an ordinary rectangle and -- Where was I? Yes, this movie. Thank you.Tony Curtis is an outstanding flier (he's the guy that does all the spinning) who comes to a Paris circus to look up the famous ex-catcher, Burt Lancaster. Curtis wants to learn how to do a triple somersault. Lancaster is a bitter gimp who advises Curtis to go back to Brooklyn, but is finally, reluctantly, won over by Curtis's enthusiasm and youthful talent.The two of them begin working on a circus act at the Cirque d'Hiver in Paris. Then -- cherchez la femme. Gina Lollobrigida dressed in brief spangles and a dazzling smile worms her way into the act. First she seduces Curtis. Then she seduces Lancaster. Conflict ensues. Lancaster winds up with Lollobrigida, Curtis with the triple somersault he craves.I'm not sure who got the better deal. Gina Lollobrigida is stunning in her 1950s way. Her features are so even, so conventionally organized, and so thoroughly covered with make up that her head would look completely comfortable atop a mannequin's body in some high-end boutique. (That doesn't make her ugly.) And the triple somersault is supposed to be so difficult that Lancaster is only one of some three or four people to have ever mastered it. Actually I read somewhere that it's not that tough.This is a better movie than Cecil B. DeMille's ""The Greatest Show on Earth."" DeMille seemed to assume that no one in his audience had ever seen a circus and everyone longed to see one, so the screen time is filled with parades of Disney characters and other extraneous bombast. ""Trapeze"" avoids most of that or brushes it off as inconsequential except as it directly affects the plot. In other words the director, Carol Reed (""The Third Man,"" et al) feels that the audience is more interested in the characters than in seeing half a dozen Indian elephants trundle past us wearing clown hats. Reed gives us credit for having seen a circus and for having the intelligence to buy tickets if we want to see Mickey Mouse strut his stuff on the sawdust. DeMille's movie is full of reaction shots, the audience of nuclear families cheering and clapping orgasmically at the ongoing nonsense. Reed shows us virtually nothing of the audience during the trapeze act except during crises, when we see only the circus cadre staring tensely upwards.In 1956, when this was released, Tony Curtis was still in the heart throb phase of his career, but Reed has subdued him and he turns in a believable and thoughtful performance, the kind he later showed he was capable of in movies like ""The Outsider"" and ""The Boston Strangler."" He did some splendid comedies too, and that's nothing to be sneezed at. Lancaster is his reliable self in this serious role. What a physical specimen he was. Lollobrigida is beautiful but, for whatever reason, perhaps the script, she's only bland and beautiful.I'm giving this movie a bonus point for demonstrating what a real circus is like, without the flamboyance and the condescension. For instance, Lancaster begins the film as a rigger. He checks knots and so forth upstairs. Now, is that a glamor occupation or what?",1
4,"Visually-exciting Big Top melodrama from director Carol Reed, here staging some incredible trapeze sequences for an otherwise mundane soap opera concerning crippled ex-trapeze artist who is lured back into the air by a young upstart, only to squabble with him over a sexy lady who wants her share of the spotlight. Fantastic aerial photography gives the viewer a dizzying sense of vertigo, but what goes on after the show is over is strictly a wheeze. Burt Lancaster (himself an ex-circus performer) spearheaded this project, and he has seldom looked more robustly handsome; his moody character (angry and brooding, with a chip on his shoulder) is, however, a drag on the action. Tony Curtis and Gina Lollobrigida fare much better with somewhat warmer roles--Curtis, in particular, gets a grand opportunity here to shine and show off--though this triangle isn't fresh and the plot of ""Trapeze"" isn't very intriguing. ** from ****",-1
8,"Burt Lancaster, Tony Curtis and Gina Lollabrigida star in ""Trapeze,"" a 1956 film directed by Carol Reed and also starring Katy Jurado, Thomas Gomez and Johnny Puleo. Lancaster plays a former trapeze artist turned rigger, Mike Ribble, working in a Paris circus. A once great artist, he is grounded due to a permanent injury while doing his famous triple. He is approached by Tino Orsini (Tony Curtis), a talented aerialist who wants to learn the triple. Ribble sees the man's talent immediately, takes him on, and agrees to be his ""grabber,"" the man who catches him mid-air. Problem arise when the beautiful, seductive user Lola (Gina Lollabrigida) who plays both men in order to be part of the act.Director Reed gives the viewer the vivid experience of working in the circus and the resulting pressure cooker of relationships. The trapeze work is glorious, and there is plenty of it.Lancaster has the major role, and he gives an excellent performance as a man with no illusions who, through Tino, dares to dream again. His muscular build is shown to great advantage as well. Curtis is excellent as the young, ambitious Tino who falls hard for Lola. Lollabrigida is gorgeous and sexy as the alluring Lola - she does a good job, but really, all she has to do is stand there and she IS the role. The supporting cast is solid, including Katy Jurado as an ex-girlfriend of Mike's and Thomas Gomez as the owner of the circus.I don't have any figures, but I suspect this film was a big hit. It led to another Lancaster-Curtis collaboration, Sweet Smell of Success, so for that reason alone, it would be worth it. However, Trapeze flies on its own merits.",1
9,"It's mighty hard to fit a three-ring circus within the confines of a postage-stamp screen. Cecil B. De Mille tried it with ""The Greatest Show On Earth"". I always had the feeling that something far more exciting was happening in the out-of-focus background or in the out- of-sight wings than the tin-pot drama unfolding within view.I was right. It took CinemaScope to fully uncover the thrills and excitement a circus has to offer. Mind you, CinemaScope in the eyes of an unimaginative director has little impact (don't see ""Ring of Fear""). But in the hands of a great storyteller like Carol Reed, and with the talents of superb stylists like photographer Robert Krasker, composer Malcolm Arnold, and art director Rino Mondellini fully utilized, CinemaScope delivers a mighty punch. In the main, I thought the actors handled their chores engagingly and with charismatic aplomb. With one exception, they all made the script — clichéd though it may have been — come alive for me. That exception was Gina Lollobrigida who played the silly dialogue with far more seriousness than it deserved. But aside from her soap opera posturings, the acting was generally well-judged. Both Lancaster and Curtis, who often seemed to be doing their own stunts, came across appealingly, and there were some attractive portrayals from the support cast — from Thomas Gomez, Katy Jurado, even Minor Watson, and most notably from Johnny Puleo as the dwarf.",1
6,"Burt Lancaster (as Mike Ribble), Tony Curtis (as Tino Orsini) and Gina Lollobrigida (as Lola) form a love triangle under the big top. Mr. Lancaster is the older trapeze artist, who continues to fly high, despite suffering from a chronic injury sustained performing the film's famed ""triple somersault"". Mr. Curtis is Lancaster's brash young protégée; of course, he wants to perform the dangerous ""triple somersault"". When Ms. Lollobrigida arrives on the circus scene, things understandably heat up for the tightly costumed trio. ""Trapeze"" is too cliché-ridden to take very seriously. Still, director Carol Reed and cinematographer Robert Krasker create some lovely, colorful, and atmospheric circus scenes. And the performers, particularly Lollobrigida, are in fine form. ****** Trapeze (5/30/56) Carol Reed ~ Burt Lancaster, Tony Curtis, Gina Lollobrigida",1
6,"Great curio piece with Burt Lancaster being a former circus performer, the film was something of a big success on its initial release. It's not hard to see why either, because it's a solid enough story backed up by great aerial sequences set to the backdrop of circus life. The love triangle between the three leads (our intrepid trapeze artists) that threatens to envelope them with disastrous consequences, is never less than intriguing, and of course we get led into a breath holding finale that achieves the desired effect.Sadly for me the acting here lets the film down, Lancaster does ""OK"" and holds the film together, and I really liked Thomas Gomez as the money orientated Bouglione, but it is here is where the Tony Curtis detractors get their ammunition from. Curtis is very wooden and it's hard to believe this is the same actor from The Defiant Ones & The Boston Strangler. Katy Jurado is reduced to being a bit part player, and as the female lead, Gina Lollobrigida looks gorgeous but delivers her lines in unconvincing fashion.This is good honest entertainment, with some exuberant set-pieces that raise the pulses, but ultimately it becomes bogged down by some less than memorable acting. 6/10",1
8,"Mike Ribble (Burt Lancaster) is a great trapeze artist who becomes injured one day during an act and ends up just being a rigger. Years later young naive Tino Orsini (Tony Curtis) seeks him out to learn how to become a great trapeze artist. They get along fantastic but sexy Lola (Gina Lollobrigida) joins the act and plays them against one another.The story and dialogue are pretty terrible but everything else is great. The trapeze acts themselves are VERY impressive and the wonderful direction by Carol Reed makes you feel like you're right there watching the acts. It's even more impressive when you realize Lancaster did most of his own stunts (he worked in a circus before he started acting). Curtis and Lollobrigida must have used doubles but it's so well edited and directed you can't tell. Wait till you see Lancaster and Curtis (or more precisely their doubles) walking down the street on their hands! The basic love story here is boring and has been done countless times before this movie (and since) but there IS a subtle but strong homosexual subtext going on here. The sexual chemistry between Curtis and Lancaster comes through. Lancaster gets REALLY upset when Lollobrigida wants to join the act and mentions more than once than he can only work with Tino. But this isn't explored (they couldn't in 1956) and it just settles down to a conventional lovers triangle. It ends with an ending that I didn't buy for one second and I think Lollobrigida's character got off WAY too easy...but you have to take into account when this was made. Also Lancaster gives out one of his best performances. Incredibly handsome and sexy but you see his pain and bitterness. Curtis is good too but not as good as Lancaster. Lollobrigida is as good as she can be with the evil sexy woman role. So the terrible story and dialogue hurt but the acting, directing, fast pace and incredible aerial acts more than compensate. I give this an 8.",1
5,"Remember Cornel Wilde's accident from The Greatest Show on Earth? Remember that Burt Lancaster turned down that role? There was really no reason to make Trapeze, except to give Burt a second chance and to give United Artists a shot at getting as much money as Paramount Studios did four years earlier. It's a shameless copy, so if your principles are greater than your desire to see Burt Lancaster in a tight leotard performing almost all his own stunts, you can stick with the original and give Cornel Wilde his due.In case your love of Burt wins out and you decide to rent Trapeze, you can expect a semi-sequel of the 1952 movie plot that he turned down. In a circus doing a European tour, a crippled former trapeze artist gets sucked back into the limelight when a young upstart, Tony Curtis, promises to be his greatest pupil. Meanwhile, a beautiful ladder-climber, Gina Lollobrigida, tries to steal the limelight from them. She doesn't have much experience on the trapeze, but when she finds out they'll get more attention than she will, she sets out to seduce Burt to get him to include her in the act. Burt is older and wiser, and he sees right through her. He turns her offer down, so she moves on to Tony.
Gina's character is a horrible person, and Tony's youthful enthusiasm is quite irritating. You're really only watching this movie for Burt, not only for the leotard and the stunts, but also because his character is the only one with any brains or heart. Gina is transparent, cruel, and selfish, but a love triangle is still interesting when it involves someone who isn't worth it. This movie may have a slow start, but you'll get sucked into it in spite of yourself.I still maintain that Trapeze didn't need to be made, but it was entertaining. And the one aspect it succeeded where The Greatest Show on Earth failed was the seediness of the profession. In 1952, most of the characters were made out to be good people with morals and high enthusiasm for their craft. Anyone who's been to the circus knows that's not an accurate depiction.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. The camera swings to and fro in many of the trapeze scenes, and that will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""",-1
8,"I've always had a soft spot for this film and am not absolutely sure what it is because it is not the sort of film that I usually have such feelings for. It is just possible I saw it in the cinema in my childhood in the late 50s but whatever it is, seeing it again is always a pleasure. Burt Lancaster, of course, is great and Gina Lollobrigida but there is something about the spectacle. Also whenever there is a circus sequence or some conversation, always in the background there is something else happening. There is a wonderful sense of being in a really busy, exciting place where almost anything might happen and that there is no rigid direction, although ironically there must have been to get it all so right. The actual trapeze sequences are fine and never overlong, these could easily have become boring but there is always just enough drama and conflict mixed in with the endeavour. The exterior scenes of mainly backstreet Paris are also wonderful and if created in the studio they are very well done. I stayed in the Rue Amelot in Paris some years ago and part of the circus building had been retained as a bar. It being August it was closed but always a pleasant reminder.",1
7,"Enjoyed this great 1956 Classic film starring Burt Lancaster, (Mike Riddle) who gave an outstanding performance as an experienced trapeze artist. In real life, Burt left Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois in his second year and decided to join a circus and traveled all around performing on the high wires. As Burt's movie career became successful, he had the opportunity to make this picture which he had longed to do for many years. Burt teams up with Tony Curtis, (Tino Orsini) who gave a great supporting role along with the beautiful Gina Lollobrigida, (Lola) who added her great charm to this picture and had two men fighting over her for her love. Thomas Gomez,(Bouglione) was the circus manager and gave an outstanding performance to his role as a man who ran his circus with an iron fist. This is a great picture with great veteran actors, enjoy.",1
7,"Burt Lancaster started his career as a circus acrobat, and in ""Trapeze"" he gets to play a circus acrobat. This was one of a number of circus- themed films released in the fifties and sixties; others include ""The Greatest Show on Earth"", ""The Big Circus"" and ""The Magnificent Showman"". Lancaster plays Mike Ribble, a former ""flyer"". This does not mean he is a retired pilot; ""flyer"" is the name by which trapeze artistes refer to themselves. In his youth Ribble, only the sixth man to have performed the triple somersault, was a major star, but retired after being injured in an accident and now works as a rigger at a circus in Paris.Ribble is tracked down by Tino Orsini, an ambitious, up-and-coming young flyer who believes that he can become the seventh man to achieve the triple and asks Ribble to train him. Ribble, impressed by the young man's potential, agrees, and the two men form an act together, with Ribble acting as Orsini's catcher. Trouble arises, however, when the circus owner wants to add a third member, a young woman named Lola, to their act. Lola is less skilled as a trapeze artiste than either Ribble or Orsini, but she looks good in a skimpy costume so the owner thinks she will be good box-office. When both men fall in love with Lola the resulting tensions threaten to destroy both their act and their friendship.The film did well at the box office, but was not always popular with the critics; Bosley Crowther of the New York Times, for example, called the story ""dismally obvious and monotonous"" and said that Gina Lollobrigida as Lola ""had only her looks to show"". There is perhaps some justice in these criticisms. The love-triangle plot is trite and clichéd, and although that circus manager was undoubtedly right that Lollobrigida does indeed look stunning, she is all too obviously struggling with the difficulties of acting in a language not her own. (This was her first American film).In other respects, however, the film is a lot better than Crowther thought it was. Carol Reed is perhaps best remembered today for serious black-and-white dramas, especially films noirs like ""The Third Man"" and ""The Man Between"", but he shows there that he was also capable of handling more spectacular, crowd-pleasing entertainment. This is not Burt Lancaster's greatest film, but he gives a very competent performance and even performed some of his own stunts. (The studio, however, insisted on a stunt man for the more dangerous ones). There is a good contrast between the ageing Ribble and Tony Curtis's brash newcomer Orsini. The aerial action sequences remain thrilling nearly sixty years after they were filmed. The circus genre may have declined in popularity in recent decades, but ""Trapeze"" shows well why such films were popular in their heyday. 7/10",1
7,"Before ""The Greatest Showman"", there was ""Trapeze"", okay, and ""The Greatest Show On Earth"" but this three-hander, starring Burt Lancaster, Tony Curtis and Gina Lollobrigida more than wipes the sawdust with its better-known rivals.Sure it too employs every big top cliche going and for good measure throws in a scarcely credible love triangle covering every angle among the three principals, i.e. Burt's character clearly loves Tony's character in a tough-love fatherly way, which is reciprocated adoringly by the new young protege, until Gina comes between the two men, not only threatening to break their bond of masculine friendship but also their professional relationship, just when they're on the verge of completing an almost legendary triple somersault trick which could see them recruited by a big-name circus for better big-top fame and fortune.Evocatively and colourfully set in Paris, director Carol Reed does a good job managing the silly to-ing and fro-ing plot and especially the filming of the highwire stunts. Of course it helps that Lancaster worked as a circus acrobat in his youth but with clever editing and camera-positioning, you almost believe Curtis and Lollobrigida were trapezists too.Lancaster dominates the screen as the central character Mike Ribble, around whom the whole film revolves and unsurprisingly he carries off this responsibility with no little aplomb or panache. Curtis is fit and handsome as the adoring but still ambitious protege and while Lollobrigida is typecast as the feisty Latino heartbreaker, she does at least convince the viewer of her ability to bewitch any man she meets.So roll up roll up and hurry hurry to watch this wonderfully daft and over-the-big-top feature, a splendid time is guaranteed for all.",1
8,"Almost a great circus movie, (if such a thing could exist), ""Trapeze"" comes closer than most to capturing the tawdry excitement of the milieu. While most circus pictures are aimed at kids this is aimed, if not quite at adults, then at least at older kids. It's sexy and it makes the whole business of being a trapeze artist seem like the sexiest, most exciting thing in the world.It's about the rivalry that can develop, both professionally and romantically, between artists and the director, Carol Reed, gives the film a charge that his more famous and infinitely more civilized films don't have. As the trio of artists who are almost consumed by their passions Burt Lancaster, Tony Curtis and Gina Lolobrigida have an instinctive rapport. Lancaster and Curtis' performances here seem like a dry run for their work a year later in ""Sweet Smell of Success"" and Lolobrigida never looked or acted better. Although Lancaster wasn't young when he made this, he's like the biggest kid in the playground and seems to be having a hell of a time while Lolobrigida is a dynamic tease.",1
5,"TrapezeThe best thing about being a trapeze artist is you're safe when the circus elephants stampede below.But, as this drama demonstrates, there are plenty more dangers under the big top.Aspirant high wire aerialist Tino Orsini (Tony Curtis) heads off in search of an injured trapeze legend Mike Ribble (Burt Lancaster) so that Mike can teach him the deadly triple-somersault routine that nearly ruined him.But Tino is not the only performer interested in Mike's attention as an attractive tumbler (Gina Lollobrigida) joins the ranks and drives a jealous wedge between Tino and his mentor.Needles to say, this love triangle begins to affect their precarious performance.Despite its capable male leads, exciting backdrop and array of aerial feats, this sluggish melodrama never gets off the ground thanks to its lacklustre script and amoral leading lady.Furthermore, I always thought injured circus performers were fed to the clowns.Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",-1
10,"Burt Lancaster is the most impressing character here, although both Tony Curtis and Gina Lollobrigida are almost equal to him and many of the other actors as well. The circus world is admirably caught on screen with all its chaotic ingredients of loose ends and relationships, cynical direction bordering on cruelty, elephants and horses, lions breaking loose and of course no limits to intrigue, as there are constant threats of artists quitting. But this is actually a film about the problems of relationships in matters of artistic perfection - they just can't mix. Burt and Tony find each other, but then there is Gina, and Burt, with his greater experience, immediately sees Gina as a mortal threat to the artistry, and so she is, no matter how clever and endearing she appears as she enforces her ambitions at the cost of others. The end is arguable - what actually happens? Will they be able to continue, or will they not? The end is typically abstruse and ambiguous for Carol Reed - he ended a number of his films in the same way with a remaining unanswerable question mark.Above all, the film is a feast to the eyes, after his first colour film ""A Kid for Two Farthings"" the year before he has considerably developed his artistry for utilizing colours and cinemascope to the full - the film is from beginning to end sparkling with colourful life and actually fathoms the whole circus life completely in all human, animal and artistic aspects. There are some scenes that hit the roof in excellence and unsurpassable top ratings, all the trapeze scenes above all, but also minor scenes, like when Burt and Tony walk on their hands on the street together out of the scene. It's probably the best circus film ever made.",1
7,"Mike Ribble is a crippled trapeze aerialist who sees potential in the young Tino Orsini.But between them comes a woman named Lola.A love triangle is ready.Trapeze (1956) is directed by Carol Reed.Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis both do solid work as the leading duo.And I can't find anything wrong in Gina Lollobrigida's performance.The movie has many faults, it doesn't rise to the level it oughta rise.During the end it gets a little better, like what's happening at the hotel.Tino finds out what's going on between Mike and Lola, and it gets all nasty.And when they give it a go for the triple somersault, and the safety net is taken off.This isn't a top-notch pic when it comes to circus movies, but it's OK anyway.",1
7,"Carol Reed was one of Britain's most interesting directors, and perhaps most intriguing about his work is his unique brand of stylised realism, the two conflicting moods astutely and unforgettably blended: the handsome, dream-like snow-storm in 'Odd Man Out (1947)'; the woozy war-torn streets of Vienna in 'The Third Man (1949)'; the blending of fantasy against a working-class London background in 'A Kid for Two Farthings (1955).' With 'Trapeze (1956),' Reed deliberately contrasts his use of fantasy and realism. The circus had long held an element of prestige, having spawned a tidy sub-genre of its own, encompassing everything from Lind's 'The Flying Circus (1912)' to DeMille's 'The Greatest Show on Earth (1952).' For decades, the circus has entertained the masses with daring acts of strength and bravery, dangerous animals and extraordinary human performers. But behind this glamour is a less enchanting side of the circus – endless practice sessions, money-hungry managers, and scheming performers who'd place their own interests before those whose lives are being placed in their hands nightly. 'Trapeze' deals with the collision of these two conflicting worlds.Mike Ribble (Burt Lancaster) was once a great ""flyer"" of the trapeze, one of the few men who could execute a triple somersault. However, a tragic accident left him with a permanent limp, and Mike has since lost all interest in the sport he once dominated. That, at least, is until Tino Orsino (Tony Curtis) arrives in Paris, a keen acrobat who seeks Mike's expert instruction. That Ribble eventually agrees to the partnership is, of course, a given, and their ultimate accomplishments are never in any doubt, but the interplay between Lancaster and Curtis is authentic and entertaining. Reed depicts the indomitable circus prestige through audience applause and the cheerful melody of the ""Blue Danube"" waltz. When the antagonism being played out behind-the-scenes inexorably spills out into the performing arena, both the applause and the music comes to a standstill. Thus, interjecting into this fantasy world comes the realisation that the circus performers are only human. The reality suddenly becomes clear: one mistake will spell almost certain death.Though Mike and Tino make a formidable team, a romantic complication arises in Lola (Gina Lollobrigida), an ambitious acrobat who'd betray her friends and promise love to anybody whom she thought could aid her career. Lola's exploits are contemptible throughout the film, garnering little sympathy from the audience; one might even suggest that the beating she receives at the hands of her former partners is almost justified by her actions. In any case, the film's conclusion is far too kind to her. Lola chases Mike down a quiet Paris street, perhaps a complementary allusion to Holly Martin's shameful snubbing in the final moments of 'The Third Man (1949).' Maintaining the optimism that Reed displayed previously in 'A Kid for Two Farthings,' this ending offers redemption rather than disgrace to Lola, who is seen to have betrayed her companions, much as Martins betrayed Harry Lime and Anna Schmidt. Most impressive of all is Robert Krasker's creative photography, frequently offering the audience a breathtaking ""birds-eye"" view of the trapeze routines, like leaning over a precipice into open space.",1
8,"**SPOILERS** Yeah, ""Trapeze"" is gonna be playing on Turner Movie Classics this afternoon, and I'm gonna watch it again. Wowee, gee, whiz.. Burt who? Tony what? Circus? The movie IS Gina Lolobrigida. When it played on our local station's broadcast of whatever national corporation's directors told them to, I, and my cohorts sat as close to the set as possible for one reason. NOT Tony Curtis. NOT Burt Lancanster, just Gina. Everything else in the movie fades to obscurity next to her.I worked for a small circus for a short time, and from what I could tell, Flying (Trap work) is about timing, precision, and strength. None of the Flyers I briefly knew were anything like Gina. Then again, none of them ever kept me awake at night, either.",1
4,"I'm not sure I really understood this movie. I admired the acrobatics, which were often very impressive. Orsini's conflict between his love for Lollabrigida and his desire to be a great trapeze artist was never really developed, and since Lollabrigida's character is so scheming, it's hard to sympathize with his feelings for her. Lancaster's desire to have a ""pure"" act, a line repeated over and over in opposition to having a woman in the act, seems strange. (Though never homo erotic. There are lines that, coming from other actors directed differently, could have suggested some sort of homo erotic attraction on Lancaster's character's part, but in this movie there is just no hint of that at all.) As I said, I enjoyed the acrobatics, but the story and the characters left me flat, even though Lancaster is one of my favorite actors.",-1
8,"Burt Lancaster, Tony Curtis, and Gina Lollbrigida star in ""Trapeze,"" which depicts the life of trapeze artists in a circus. Tony Curtis wants to be a great trapeze artist and thinks he's ready for it, except for one thing, the triple somersault. And, he needs Burt Lancaster to teach him. But, Burt has quit the spotlight since he tried the triple and fell. But, when he sees Tony and what he can do, he thinks Tony can do a triple. But, he won't tell him so, at first. Enter Gina. She has a wire act of her own, and she want to get in on the main attraction. And, of course, love enters the picture.This may have a why should I care? feel to it, as it may not interest some people at all. But for those who will be watching for the stars, the rewards are many. This is a more personal and realistic (of course how should I know) story and treatment of what goes on beyond the high wire act than Cecil B. DeMille's ""The Greatest Show on Earth."" We are allowed to see beyond the glamorous lifestyle and see them as people who are trying to express themselves while existing here on this earth. This has a deep respect for its subject matter and its characters and shows how they have to work together in order for the act to work, and not just because of the obvious physical risks involved but because they are supposed to be a team and not looking out only for themselves.Plus, Lancaster apparently had some experience in this and performed most of his stunts, and, after Tony and Gina practiced a lot, they did as much as they could. So you do get the real thing and some really good and sincere performances.If you want less DeMille-like glitz and more substance, then this is the circus for you.",1
7,"I remember seeing ""Trapeze"" as a youngster in the mid-1950's. But watching it recently, many decades later, I was surprised at how well it has held up.Set in a circus in Paris, Mike Ribble (Burt Lancaster), a famous trapeze artist crippled in a fall, trains a promising young aerialist, Tino Orsini (Tony Curtis).They form a strong bond and aim for Tino to complete a dangerous triple somersault. However, beautiful, ambitious Lola (Gina Lollobrigida) manipulates her way into the act, and the ensuing love triangle proves more dangerous than any somersault.In the novel that the film was based on, ""The Killing Frost"" by Max Catto, Mike Ripple's feelings towards Tino Orsini are beyond mere friendship, and he resents the arrival of the woman not just because she is interrupting their training schedule. His jealously leads to murder at the end of the book. Now a gay theme was never going to get past the censor in a 1956 movie so the ending plays out differently, but there is an undercurrent.It was shot for the most part in the Cirque d'Hiver in Paris. The director Carol Reed and Photographer Robert Krasner, who worked together on ""The Third Man"", caught the high-flying trapeze work just as brilliantly as they had captured Harry Lime scurrying down those Viennese sewers.Burt Lancaster with his circus background did many of his own stunts, but Tony Curtis and Gina Lollobrigida also did some: climbing tricky rope ladders and swinging from the platform - enough for you to believe they are really up there.Kate Buford in her book ""Burt Lancaster: An American Life"" relates how Burt Lancaster and Gina Lollobrigida did not get on, however it gave their performances bite. Lancaster looks amazing in this film; muscles, teeth and intensity. Curtis really was a star on the rise; he and Lancaster hit it off and starred together again in the brilliant ""Sweet Smell of Success"". But 'La Lollo' more than holds her own. She looks sensational with a full figure and a waist you could close your hands around.If I have a criticism, it is with the Malcolm Arnold's score. Arnold scored many British films in the 50's and 60's, and most of them sounded the same - he didn't change gears much for this one.Uninspired score aside, ""Trapeze"", with its powerhouse trio of stars and its authentic look, is a film I can happily revisit.",1
7,"Harry Broderick (Andy Griffith) is a junk dealer who is willing to buy and sell just about anything across the globe. He sees a TV news report and comes up with an idea. He would fly to the moon and retrieve the various scraps left behind by the Apollo missions. He recruits former NASA astronaut Skip Carmichael (Joel Higgins) and rocket fuel scientist Melanie Slozar (Trish Stewart) to create a revolutionary private rocket ship out of a cement mixer. The government would give it the call sign Salvage 1. There's the perfunctory black worker in the group. In the second season, the interfering government agent Klinger goes away and Melanie starts mentoring young orphan Michelle Ryan.The pilot is a fun movie. The science is crap but the movie is actually good. Andy Griffith is a great TV leading man. The premise is a little silly but good enough for a fun caper. The issue with the show is that it should stay much close to the rocket idea. This should be a series about the trio making a space travel service. They could retrieve valuable asteroids and have tourists go to the moon. The possibilities are endless. A rich benefactor could push for a trip to Mars. NASA should try harder to end the competition from their business. Industrial espionage would definitely try to steal Mel's formula. Instead, the show goes all over the place. The plot gets rather random. The gang literally rescues different horses in two different episodes in two different stories. They're seeding clouds, mining diamonds, and moving an iceberg. There is an alien episode and a robot episode. Granted, I like the robot. The show needs to stay with their revolutionary rocket. It's like somebody invented and owns the internet. Then we watch him do nothing about the internet. Nevertheless, everybody likes Andy and this is a fun short-lived series.",1
7,"Originally airing on January 20, 1979, the pilot called Salvage debuted to high ratings. It was an intriguing start to a series. Harry Broderick (Andy Griffith) and his Jettison Scrap and Salvage Co. have a dream, as stated in the show's opening words: ""I want to build a spaceship, go to the moon, salvage all the junk that's up there, bring it back and sell it.""Along with former astronaut Addison ""Skip"" Carmichael and NASA fuel expert Melanie ""Mel"" Slozar (who have a past history), they create The Vulture, a spaceship made entirely from reclaimed salvage and powered by monohydrazine (Isaac Asimov was the science consultant for this program).The TV movie was followed by 15 episodes (20 were produced), with the last 4 shows only running decades later. Despite the initial success, ABC put this show up against WKRP in Cincinnati and Little House on the Prarie. That explains why it died a quick death.I remember loving the initial TV movie and this was discussed often in our home as a series that had so much potential and was stopped too quickly. Luckily, CBS Late Night would replay the original pilot and the two-part episodes ""Golden Orbit"" and ""Hard Water"" as movies. CBS Late Night was an amazing, wonderful way to spend the summer as a kid in the 1970's and 80's, as in the pre-digital (and even VCR era) it was the only way to see shows like Kolchak: The Night Stalker, The Avengers, Return of the Saint, Thriller and The Prisoner. That said, a 60-minute show would be stretched out and padded with commercials. But we didn't have many options back then!The CBS Late Night movie also played some really incredible films, like The Fearless Vampire Killers, Trog, Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed, The World, The Flesh and the Devil, Dracula Has Risen from the Grave, Frankenstein Created Woman, Dracula, Prince of Darkness, THX 1138, Gargoyles, She Waits, The Bad Seed, Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?, Count Yorga, The Victim, The Abominable Dr. Phibes, Dr. Phibes Rises Again!, The Bat People, Frogs, edited movies of Columbo, Cannon, Kojak, McMillan and Wife and Banacek, Necromancy, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, House of 1,000 Dolls (""quite possibly the sleaziest AIP movie ever made""), The Bird with the Crystal Plumage (!), Rowan and Martin's The Maltese Bippy, Killdozer, Ruby, Beyond the Door, The Devil's Rain!, the Dr. Strange TV movie, Mitchell, The Initiation of Sarah, Patrick, Ator: The Fighting Eagle, KISS Meets the Phantom of the Park, The Apple (!), It's Alive, It Lives Again, Q: The Winged Serpent, Fulci's The Psychic (!), even supposedly the legendary lost movie The Astrologer (although this list doesn't have that). These ran on free TV, folks. Where anyone could find them. I'm still just freaked out that this was available, way into the late 1980's.Just watch this and try not to be sad that the world is not as perfect as it once was.",1
8,"Salvage 1 and Buck Rogers in the 25th Century were two sci-fi series released in the same year, 1979. The USA was still in the grip of Jimmy ""malaise"" Carter and his presidency and they were probably hoping that the space race would resume under someone like Ronald Reagan who would make American strong again or something like that.Good thing about Salvage 1 was it didn't take itself very seriously. It knew its limitations, and the viewers knew that. I think Salvage 1 is in need of a reboot, and you can picture it along the lines of going to Mars, although the Mars One mission is covering this with their reality TV style program.",1
9,"I purchased a set of Salvage 1 about a year ago. The quality is not great, but the show is really good. I like the 3 main leads Andy Griffith, Joel Higgins(right before he Silver Spoons), and Trish Stewart. The pilot has them building a rocket to fly to the moon to pick up salvage. From that point on they salvage different things on the Earth. It's a show I never heard of, but I liked the concept and also Harve Bennett was in charge of the show. He was responsible for the Six Million Dollar Man and some the Star Trek movies. I highly recommend the show.",1
7,"The movie-length pilot of ""Salvage 1"" concerns a salvage man, an ex-astronaut and a few friends who build a rocket out of junk and launch it to the moon to retrieve gear from one of the Apollo sites to pay off a tax debt. Despite obviously cheap special effects, it does a great job of capturing the excitement of spaceflight, and also has some wonderfully funny moments, such as Harry Broderick (Andy Griffith) phoning the FAA to lodge their flight plan. Highly recommended for space buffs. The weekly series, in which Broderick attempts other salvage operations, was watchable but never re-captured the highs of the pilot telemovie.",1
10,"Too bad it was so short lived, another great one bites the dust, along with My world & welcome to it. I guess, most people just didn't get the humor.

Andy's soft, wise and yet accessible personae is alive and well in this show. Truly he made the show.But the premise was great too. A home made rocket ship to salvage space junk. What a great idea. The show worked too. I watched this show with my family (I was in Jr HS a the time) and it proved to be a show that we all enjoyed equally. We were, as a family, very disappointed when this show was canceled.I imagine that it had more to do with budget or keeping main cast members in place than popularity. While the show did not pull down top rating honors...it was the show that my friends and I would always get together and talk about in school.",1

I guess this one was for the Science types.And Back then the science types were the called nerds.Great Show,1
2,"I looked forward to this game when I heard of its release. I so wanted to buy it, but my dad insisted I rent it first. I have to say he was right as this had to be one of the most disappointing games I have ever played. I was a huge Spider-man and X-Men fan and this game promised to give me my favorite heroes in one game going against the insane Arcade. The premise was good, the opening story was good, the game not so much. First, it is insanely hard...I don't think I was able to complete but a couple of levels. I think the Spider-man levels were the ones I could actually do. Wolverine was in it as well...someone had a swimming level I think Storm. Other than that I can not clearly remember other X-men used. Maybe Cyclops and NightCrawler. All in all thanks to the hard and relatively short gameplay this game would be the typical X-men game released during this time. They had many games released and they all were usually really hard or short or both. Spidey had a couple of better games, but his greatness did not really start till that game for the playstation one came out. So if you want a game that really sucks and is to hard featuring the x-men and Spidey then go for this pile of crap.",-1
1,"What a disgrace to Marvel! Neither Spidey nor the X-Men come out of this with integrity left. It's seriously one of the worst games I have ever played on the Genesis. Terrible graphics, worse gameplay and awful music. For what it's worth it's a platformer (like the previous Spiderman game on the Genesis, only nowhere near as competent) in which you play different characters but start out as Spidey himself. I honestly didn't stick around too much to play as anyone else as it really did begin so badly and I can only imagine that it got worse.Don't be like me and assume that it must be good coz Spidey is involved. It would be a total waste of money. I guess I should have researched it first coz it seriously is a bad, bad game. Stay away!",-1
8,"The 16-bit era. A golden age for video games and I'm very grateful for having the opportunity to savor the great aspects of the decade which had the best to offer in movies, cartoons, comics, the works. Since I have been an avid gamer (and still is) I thought I take a trip down memory lane and alas this one popped up. This was an very difficult but fun game; no mistake about it. I heard of the Genesis version, but lucky for me I got the SNES version which is by far the best one out there with solid gameplay and graphics and fun, innovative level design. Not only do you play as everyone's favorite web slinger, but you also get a crack at the X-Men. What I really liked the most about this game is the different play styles from the characters. The music rocks, even until this day and age of more advanced hardware. Oh the memories of playing this game makes me very sentimental; a game featuring some of your favorite heroes and villains from the Marvel universe. What's not to like? One of the best games to come out on the system at the time and quite a cult classic.Here's a piece of trivia: Believe it or not this game is actually a sequel to X-Men: Madness in Murderworld that was released on the Commodore in 1989!!! Betcha never guessed that one.",1
9,"Owning a SNES, and being a fan of Spider-man, I just had to find a good game for it. I looked at others on the same system, but this one beat them all. It has our friendly neighborhood Spider-man plus 4 members of the X-men (Wolverine, Storm, Gambit, and Cyclops) in an action-packed romp! This game really does each hero justice with their powers (other games that feature Wolverine don't feature his healing ability) and the simple control scheme rather than complex button maneuvers make the gameplay a breeze. The music flat out rocks and the graphics have a good old time comic book flavor to it. My only complaints? The difficulty is sky high, and there is no option mode. Even worse you have to complete each level on a life and there are no checkpoints or a password feature. Very frustrating, but even so, I like a good challenge and this game is a lot of fun to play, even today.",1
7,"OK, so maybe this game's graphics sucked. SEGA GENESIS DOESN'T HAVE TOP OF THE LINE GRAPHICS FOR THE SECOND TIME! Sometimes, you just have to give the game a chance. Play more than 4 levels.In this game, you start out as Spidey and work your way up to helping Wolverine, Cyclops, Storm, and Gambit escape from Syberiad. Of course, Marvel doesn't offer many obstacles, but for it's time, it is a fairly decent game. Wolverine has a fairly decent stage to start out with, and Cyclops' is a little better. Gambit's stage is probably the best, but I have to admit that Storm's stage lacked everything.I give this game a ""C"" for taking a crack at ""The X-Men Adventure"" T.V. episode. Give this game a chance, people!",1
5,"Spider-Man/X-Men is basically a bad game. There are a million like it: sidescrolling platformers from the 16 and 8-bit eras starring licensed comic book, movie, and television characters. It's not innovative, it's incredibly difficult, there's not much about it that's really entertaining, the story sucks, etc.But the music rocks. It just rocks, it's like putting ELO, every 80s hair band ever, and the Spider-Man TV show from the 60s into a cement mixer. Out comes love with very good compression strength. Okay, so some of the tracks aren't that good, but most are at least fun, and a few of them will make you want to go outside and eat gravel, because it's the closest you'll ever come to feeling the rock inside you.Also, Spider-Man's swinging mechanic is actually pretty fun, considering when this game was made. The webline actually attaches at a specific point, and the swing speed and trajectory is based on the length of the webline and how soon you jump from it. Nothing to get excited about, but it's there.The best music is actually in the title screen and the first stage, and you start off as Spider-Man, so you don't have to play the game for very long to get the most you can out of it. Give it a try, if only for a few minutes.PS: You can find a rip of the game's music in SPC700 format. SNESmusic.org has more information on SPC700 and should have a rip of this particular game's.",-1
3,"I do have some history with this one; I never played the videogame myself, but I watched someone else playing it multiple times and I was hugely impressed by the quality of both graphics and gameplay. Given the Chinese interest in historical war epics, a big screen adaptation was inevitable, but sadly this is another missed opportunity. The film is bogged down in tiresome plotting and entry-level politics, while stars like Lam Suet and Louis Koo are wasted in the usual shouty and unsubtle roles. As for the plentiful and copious action sequences, let's just say the graphics in the videogame are better - yes, even in an old Playstation 2 version. It's just the usual onslaught of CGI with no attention to the laws of physics, realism or plausibility. You'd be better off playing the game!",-1
6,"Being based on a video game helped me understand things like weapon leveling. Three warriors experts in martial arts (and anti-gravity stuff) are gifted with weapons from the gods, or goddess in this case. The Han Dynasty has fallen into anarchy and is ruled by the evil Dong Zhuo who has locked away the young prince and is doing the nasty with his mother and other girls dressed in typical European Middle Age garments. In fact a lot of stuff looked European and not Chinese. One of the good guys looks almost like a Klingon. The scene where the good guy kills his family by mistake I thought was funny. It appears the Chinese do not have a word for ""uncle"" or ""nephew."" It was my ""father's blood brother"". Okay, anything wrong with saying ""uncle"" in the English version? The film seems to be the first in a series. Might want to watch it with a slight legal buzz.",1
6,"First of all, this is a movie without an actual story. It starts with a coup d'état and some people who don't take kindly to it, but it ends in the middle of the campaign. At most it's the first part of something. Then there are the characters, way too many and probably taken directly from the game, which are like superheroes in a world of feudal bureaucracy and intrigue. They fight for the sake of fighting while the world continues to turn the same way. And while the fight scenes were interesting, they weren't inspiring in any way. A lot of CGI wire-fu and elemental special effects on the weapons. Why a hero could easily destroy an entire army, but they let the armies fight first, for example, is completely weird.Second of all, I am sure there was a lot lost in translation. A lot of the politics and back stabbing and the dynamic between people is something that I feel Chinese people would understand at a glance, while I feel that everything is alien to me.Bottom line: It was not an engaging movie and while very long it didn't keep up the tension and it ended without any closure. I liked the mechanics of the fights, but I feel they could have been used a lot better to further the story.",1
6,"Its like watching a game, not movie style. It is too exaggerated with less story based. I will not pay to watch such a movie because it is only good for passing time.I gave it 6 stars for the above average special effects compared to other Chinese movies. Since its quality in movie is lacking, I cannot increase it to 7 stars.",1
8,"What most people won't appreciate is that this film is meant to be bad, the video games were over the top and ridiculous and of course this would be too.As a friend of mine said ""It's not good, but it is fun!"". If you watched this film for anything other than comical a-historical madness, I feel bad for you. Go watch a serious film like Red Cliff and feel better.Because this right here was for the fans.",1
7,"I have a feeling many of the bad reviews are from people that never played the game and were expecting a quality oscar winning movie. Or they played the game and someone had the same view that the movie would be some masterpiece. The movie is a PEFFECT match of what the game is. Fun, unadulterated action. It has many of the characters from the game, some of the weapons...etc. The movie is in now way mind blowing, deep and oscar worthy. Heck even most of the subtitles don't even match what the charecters are saying (if you decide to watch it in english with english subs). But I enjoyed the sillyness of the movie and over the top action.",1
7,"I enjoy the Dynasty Warriors games, and I was hoping this movie would be just as over-the-top and silly. I was not disappointed!This is silly, and cheesey, and the effects are purposefully laughable, and it was pretty much like watching one of the games.I think it was well-cast, and everyone had just the right amount of melodrama and seriousness in their performances.No, it's not a historical piece. No, it's not some serious drama-action like Hero. No, it's probably not even that good. But it IS very entertaining and a riot, and puts a smile on your face if you let it.",1
8,"Starting off it was just like the video game if you have played it, the yellow turbans rebellion was a perfect feel to it matching the game in many ways.While some have complained things got slower in the middle but lets honestly not forget its still a movie and not only a video game.They has to spend effort to build up some storyline and background so the viewers can understand briefly and effectively. The ones downvoting this movie probably never played the game or they just expected it to be the video game.I for one enjoyed how this movie progressed, i mean cmon they even had the Musou attacks and each warrior had their own distinct style, special effects, fighting Stance, weapons, their outfits matching their game counterparts. Hey even the electricity sparks for the weapons pays homage to the game.Lu Bu was well acted by Louis Koo who although had few lines but his facial expressions and gestures were very on point with how Lu Bu was portrayed in the games.Though the movie could have been better if they had made it much longer but i feel like they probably will make a sequel to continue the storyline so for all the people out there that complained about the ending they should really consider this :
Do you really want them to squeeze everything in the game into 1 movie causing it to be out of the place and overloaded???Cause theirs way to much characters and stories to discuss to even make a successful movie without dividing it into sequels.I have even seen complaints that certain characters are missing from the game but cmon this is the prequel story leading into the early battles of the game. They payed homages to many characters already and even the best part for me was the armies defensive formation changes which was reminiscent of the game as well.Overall i really loved this movie and i hope the sequel will pick up where it left off and be green lit! Finally the fans have their 1st live action video game adaptation done correctly and Amazingly!",1
6,The fight scenes are just as crazy as the.video game series and brought back great memories!The story is solid - has to be as the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is considered a national treasure in China and has been told and retold for hundred years.Overall I enjoyed the visual effects and storytelling.,1
2,"What was this? Is it part 1? What happened to the marriage and Lu? Did they run out of money, did they make it to long so they had to cut it off. This was a waist of 2 hours.",-1
3,"Didnt play the game so coming from a movie perspective the story is all over the place, amateur CGI, not even the huge amount of top notch hong kong veteran actors are able to save this mess. P.s the english dubbing on netflix is a nightmare/insult to asians.",-1
8,"The action, costumes and music fit very well. Of course it only uses the story of the Romance of the three Kingdoms as a background, as did the games. And of course the special actions in battle look quite unrealistic - not to say silly at times. But this is the same as the game and it fits as a movie version quite well.Also the cast is mostly fitting, only CaoCao seems very young.So for any fans of the video games (and maybe even for RoTK fans) enjoy this fun action movie for what it is.",1
4,"I play games and am very addicted, I don't know what's going on with Chinese movies now, I watch classic Chinese movies though without good CGI but they have story quality, this movie doesn't have good CGI makes the worst movies, story itself.",-1
4,"I'm ok with big action flicks with little plot and heroes wading their way through mooks. This movie takes it to a new level, and having played one version of the game it was 'accurate' in that the Heroes do ALL of the work. There is literally no reason for anyone else to fight when one dude can destroy 50+ opponents with a mighty power swing of energy doom. If I was one of those troops, I'd look at the hero on my side and say ""Go get em' tiger.""
Lu Bu's courting skills are amazing. 10 seconds to a successful marriage proposal.Many of the fight scenes were to outdated 1980's heavy metal solos which I wanted to appreciate but it became tired after a while.Costumes were good.CGI was often shameful. I miss the days when China would actually costume 500 extras. I also miss wires so it is time to re-watch Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.",-1
4,"Three Kingdoms is a very well known and rich story, and it is surprising to me it has not translated to much big screen success.Firstly casting here is a bit off the mark for me. These people don't look like warriors to me. More like office people attending a cosplay convention. Guan Yu for example looks like my IT support friend sticking on a fake beard. Hard to believe he is the fearsome warrior of legend. Actually, it's hard to believe he can even grow a beard.The fight scenes, granted this is from a video game, is a bit too much. Especially the final fight. It's like a bunch of 12-year olds made it up.The fight with Guan Yu and Hua Xiong is cooler. The lines were badass.",-1
8,I never expect greatness out of video game to movie adaptions and this was no exception. In the end that didnt necesarily make this a bad movie. In fact I kind of enjoyed it. If you are a fan of the video game the I would recommend a look.,1
5,"The story wasn't bad. The acting wasn't terrible, and the music and setting were fantastic. The problem here is that they took a highly unrealistic Magic approach that amounted to more of a Dragon ball: Evolution than a Chinese War Epic. The video game was fantastic. It used magic to represent the immense talent of these legendary historical figures. However just because that approach worked well in a game doesn't mean it would in a movie. It COULD, with the right budget, but sadly it didn't here and rather than demonstrating the heroes talent with a blade they had then flinging fireballs and flailing weapons around in extremely unrealistic and silly ways that detracted from the historical plot.A fair to mediocre effort ultimately ruined by bad CG and corny directing.",-1
7,"Dont get the low reviews,this is way better than mulan that's for sure. Captured the games perfectly.",1
5,"If you are familiar with the game , or the Chinese history, this is not your cup of tea. And where is Xing Cai ?",-1
4,"It's sort of a Chinese Kung Fu version of Avengers, but it's just not up to par.The special effects are way overboard, and the storyline is a bit silly.I'm not sure why I watched it to the end. I guess I'd already invested over an hour by the time I realised it was not going to get any better.Don't bother.",-1
8,I like this movie... CaoCao make mistake killing his bloodline by having bad dream.. the fight still not yet end.,1
10,"Really cool and amazing and specially if u dedicated to the game , some said they played the game and didn't like the movie , well trust me its a lies 100% , so such these people liked marvel movies but not dynasty warriors !!! Fantasy fights not only for marvel movies and the rest can do that it is not prohibited and legal !!!",1
10,"PlayStation ran a series of these tiltes throughout its history.Packed with the same over the top action and huge fictional combat hits as the game.The story appears to follow the game in various parts. If you have played the game then you will find many similarities. Then when they debuted Lu Bu (the most awesome and feared character in the game taking down droves of enemies), it was as I imagined.Entertaining.",1
10,"When the Earth explodes, tons and tons of junk finds its way into space. The Alientologists gather up anything they can: color crayons, lamps, a bra, and, finally, a working jukebox. But when the music starts and a bevy of tap shoes are brought on board--well use your imagination. I found the utter joy that ensues from these stark, bored scavengers after their discovery to be one of the great delights I've known.",1
10,NO SPOILERS - I can get a little jaded rolling through video after video looking for something worth sharing with my friends. But THIS!!?? This wonderfully happy little piece of joy is going to EVERYBODY!! Thank you so much to everyone involved for making the hunt for video treasures worth the time and effort.,1
10,"It has chills, it has thrills, it's heartwarming, a tearjerker, and it's a musical! What more can you ask for. This film is so clever and so surprising, and the acting is stellar. Clever bits throughout, including using a song called ""After You're Gone."" I've watched it twice so far, and it doesn't disappoint. The alien language was also very clever! Wow, thank you so much DUST for sending us such good work.",1
10,"Don't want to give spoilers, but since in the summary it says Earth no longer exists I'll go only so far.This is quite simply an amazing and heartfelt story about the joys of discovery, and on the whole we as humans leaving behind a wonderful gift which represents one of our best and not worst qualities. I can watch it over and over and the thinking is way outside the box on a sci fi short.",1
9,No expensive sets required for this great storytelling. A phenomenal short film that had me appreciate an art form I had never really enjoyed! The actors communicative skills are awsome.,1
8,"The cartoon does start off a tad too slow, and the story is on the predictable side. But Jerry and Jumbo is a rock-solid Tom and Jerry cartoon, that is both hilarious and cute. The animation is really nice and colourful as these cartoons usually are, and the music is delightful. The sight gags serve their purpose well too, the best being the running gag of Jumbo sucking things with his trunk with such powerful force, and the ending is very unexpected in a good way. The pacing is in general brisk and efficient, and the characters are great, the best actually being the very cute elephant Jumbo. Overall, a rock-solid cartoon with a lot going for it. 8/10 Bethany Cox",1
8,"Boy, they really stretch credibility here, right from the start....but it's a cartoon and, as we all know, ""anything goes"" in animated shorts. Here, a baby elephant on a circus train falls out of a compartment, rolls down a hill, tumbles through the front door, over furniture and lands in Tom's sleeping basket! Yeah, right!The story centers around the elephant being painted to look a big version of Jerry and you know who is going to get the short end of the stick regarding violence and pain. There are good sight gags in here, different things, mainly with the little mouse/big mouse theme. Another major element is the incredible sucking power of the elephant's trunk. It's a solid entry in the Tom & Jerry collection with a good mix of comedy and cuteness. One wonders, though, during all the commotion, where were the people who own the house?",1
8,"A baby elephant falls from a moving circus train and rolls into a house, landing in Tom's basket. Jerry befriends the new arrival, disguising it to look like a giant mouse in order to terrorise Tom.In the world of Tom and Jerry, a painted pachyderm (its trunk rolled up and coloured black) looks just like a giant mouse; if you can swallow such a silly concept, then Jerry and Jumbo should deliver lots of laughs, the highlight for me being the classic 'mirror' routine whereby Tom runs to and fro past a gap in the wall, the mouse and the elephant taking it in turns to mimic the cat's movements.There are lots of laughs to be had as Tom tries to figure out what is happening, before the baby elephant's mother arrives and joins in on the fun, becoming an even larger 'mouse', all of which sends the poor cat completely off his rocker.",1
8,"This Tom & Jerry cartoon I just found and watched on the DVD of Billy Rose's Jumbo. It has a baby elephant stumble from a moving train to the house where the cat and mouse live. That elephant first goes in Tom's bed under his blanket before that cat goes there for his rest. I'll stop here and just say what happens after that is quite hilarious especially the way it all ends, that's for sure! So on that note, I highly recommend Jerry and Jumbo.",1
8,Because baby elephant Jumbo masquerading as an overgrown Jerry is pretty much my spirit animal. Classic T&J short. Great ending,1
8,"This ""Tom and Jerry"" short from 1953 called ""Jerry and Jumbo"" is one fun entertaining one where a baby elephant falls off a traveling show train only to end up in Tom and Jerry's home! However Jerry plays clever with his new friend in the form of paint and art as it's like bigger and new elephants are created try a trio! The episode is fun full of chase and Tom once again is outsmarted plus it 's memorable for it fun little cute elephant.",1
8,"This is a short in the Tom and Jerry series from MGM. There will be spoilers ahead:The short begins with two elephants in an open train car-Mama elephant and her baby. The baby is inexplicably sleeping in the open doorway when he rolls right out of the car, down a slope and right into the home and bed of Tom the cat. The elephant hides and the fun begins, fun being the elephant spooking the daylights out of Tom.First, Tom climbs into bed on top of the elephant, now under Tom's blanket. Tom's startled by the elephant's trunk and while Tom is distracted, the elephant makes a hasty getaway. Hungry, the unknown house guest inhales Tom's milk from his bowl, further disturbing Tom.Tom goes investigating, finds Jerry and blames him for the disappearing milk. Just as Tom is about to bash Jerry, he's rescued by elephant suction power and the two join forces. There's a nice bit with a bag of peanuts which scatters on the floor which Jumbo makes march under the closet door, which tells Tom where they are.The meat of the cartoon is here. Jerry gets the bright idea to paint Jumbo up to look like a large mouse and Tom's nightmare begins. Tom gets pummeled, whacked, squashed and is put upon in general, all while trying to figure out just what's happening. Then Tom starts shooting at Jumbo and Jerry.Mama finds her baby and the stage is set for a beautiful ending. I actually felt sorry for Tom. There's just so much any cat can take!This short is available on DVD and is well worth finding. Recommended.",1
7,"A little circus elephant ends up in the home of Tom and Jerry. When some strange things happen Tom thinks it is Jerry who causes them, but in fact it is the elephant. When Tom gets mad at Jerry the elephant helps the little mouse and they start working together.The short starts a little boring but once the elephant dresses up as a mouse to give Tom a hard time it gets hilarious and I had a very good time.",1
7,"Not a bad cartoon, and it does pick up after the setup. I'm surprised though that no one has commented on the unoriginality of using exactly the same plot device as the several Sylvester the cat and Hippety Hopper cartoons, where Sylvester mistakes a baby kangaroo for a giant mouse, gets beat up, goes crazy, etcetra, etcetera. I guess there's only so many ideas to be had for cat-mouse battles, so you gotta get 'em where you can? Then there's also that Tom and Jerry cartoon that copies another Looney Tunes even more precisely - Bugs Bunny as concert pianist fighting a mouse sleeping inside the piano, leading to chaos vs a proper formal recital. Tom and Jerry did the same thing a little later - even used the same piece of classical music! Makes me wonder what other ideas were ""borrowed"" from Looney Tunes. No matter. If it's done well, still a worthy short.",1
10,"And that includes almost all cartoons animated in the years 1944-1952.
Jerry and Jumbo was animated in 1951, but released in 1953.
These cartoons had the best look/animation, still Tom & Jerry developed in that era few times: I would say 1944/45, next 1946/47, then the ""classic"" look 1947-1950, and 1951/52.
Gags were great, not too cute like in later years and not too slow just like in the early years. The cartoons from first 3 years were with more than 8 minutes a little bit too long and not that fresh and naughty like the cartoons from 1944-52 with the great ideas.Ps.: Rhapsody Rabbit was made the same year The Cat Concerto was made (1946):
From Wikipedia ""Both MGM and Warner Bros. accused each other of plagiarism, after both films were shown in the 1947 Academy Awards Ceremony. Technicolor was accused of sending a print of either cartoon to a competing studio, who then plagiarized their rival's work. This remains uncertain even today: though Rhapsody Rabbit has an earlier MPAA approval number and release date, MGM's cartoons took longer to make.""
That one goes to an early review by another user.",1

Meanwhile the boy next door gives a few mixed signals.There's nothing terribly new here but this situation is always interesting. However its a bad sign when you start checking how much time is left in the short.",1
6,"Okay, so this wasn't the best short film. I just wanted to see it because it starred Tom Lenk (one of the best actors around).I don't know if it's a good thing or not that he can play a gay character so well, but he did a good job (another example of this is his character on 'BtVS'). I found his portrayal amusing if anything. I found the sister character really annoying and I was rooting for Tom the whole way.The plot was rather basic and we've seen similar things a million times before, but hey, it's something to watch when you're bored. All in all, I'd give it 6 out of 10 just for Tom Lenk's performance.",1
7,"An amiable and amusing mockumentary, 18 FINGERS OF DEATH stands roughly in the same relation to Kung Fu movies as SPINAL TAP does to rock music. Low rent action star Buford Lee (James Lew, familiar from supporting roles BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA, THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS and TRAFFIC), sporting a certifiable Bruce Lee accent, is trying to get his new martial arts film 18 FINGERS.. off the ground. His travails are recorded by first time documentary maker, ever enthusiastic fan Ronald Mack (Maurice Patten). Along the way there are gentle parodies of martial arts heroes 'Stephen Seafood' 'Chuck Snorris' and most memorably, 'Antonio Bandana' etc, extracts from Buford's previous releases and scenes of the rehearsal and shooting of his latest one. Much of the acting on offer here is fine and the cinematography is excellent too (my DVD box claims the ratio is 4:3 but it is actually 1.85:1). The relationship between Lee and Mack is what gives the film its gravity  one especially relishes the scene when the star proudly shows him his collection of treasured Kung Fu memorabilia, including 'the actual socks worn by Bruce Lee in Enter the Dragon' (sadly unwashed) - and the obvious affection shown the genre by the principals shines through constantly. It's a shame that the film somewhat runs out of steam at the end, especially once Mack has left the story. Occasionally too, jokes could have been sharper, a fact especially true of the late, extended fight scene between Bandana and Lee which plays out the old farting routine for too long, its introduction a sure sign that invention is flagging. One misses the insane surreality which appeared in KUNG POW its absence due, perhaps wisely, to 18 FINGERS' recognition that such elements would appear somewhat jarring in the context of a supposed factual format. But the buoyant Patten is a real find, one of the best things in the picture in fact, clearly a talent to watch, Lew's more restrained performance allowing his co star his head. On my copy some of the action scenes seemed a bit dark, but this is not too much of a distraction. All in all, this is worth watching, with no real slow patches, although as one might expect martial arts fans  and lovers of straight-to-video chock socky - will laugh the most.",1
2,"Do not spend your money on this movie. I love mockumentaries and potty humor but I did not even crack a smile during this entire film. I gave it 2 stars 'cuz Pat Morita was in it. I am still baffled at how this kind of crap gets backing and then money is spent to promote it, and then it's distributed, etc. I'm all for up and coming talent but keep the small budget crap on the shelf for art's sake. Release it later if the director or an actor/actress makes it big later on. Why do I keep falling for this crap. Those who wrote positive reviews must be very very brainless or a part of the film in some way.If your friend spends his/her money on this move...kung fu his butt and don't watch this. My eyes still burn. Help me.",-1
1,"I went into seeing this with no idea of the concept & no notion of what I would be watching.It was 4 house-mates & friends, along with myself. Total 5 people, all with vastly differing movie tastes to say the least. However there is one thing were were all unified on for once, it took us less than 30 minutes to decide to turn this movie off & save what few braincells we had that either thankfully slept thru this torture or didn't succeed at committing suicide in a rage against me for forcing them to acknowledge this trash.Since I cant submit a rating of 0 for the movie, I was forced to give it a rating of 1, which in my opinion is 2 more than it deserves.Save yourself the time wasted & the mental anguish & AVOID this movie!",-1
1,"This movie is absolutely horrible. Let me clarify, the first 20 minutes that I forced down were absolutely horrible. This movie is about as interesting as air. It's sad that it compares itself with Kung Fu Hustle. Using the same font and graphics layout as the Kung Fu Hustle DVD did. Don't be fooled. This is just a wanna-be decent movie hiding beneath a decent cover and some huge martial artists who aren't even given decent rolls. If you want to see a good funny martial arts movie check out: Kung Fu Hustle, Shaolin Soccer, or any other Stephen Chow film. This movie doesn't even compare to Kung Pow: Enter the Fist. I like stupid movies, but the movie still needs to be entertaining.",-1
1,"This movie supposed to be funny ??? it ain't even near to the definition of the word ! it is by far the worst comedy i've ever seen !! at first i thought that it can't be that bad, just that the start is just lame, and later on the movie will be funny,,,, but hey, my mistake...it even got worse !!I couldn't even bare to watch it till the end, it got so boring, and stupid !!If you like to sleep in front of the TV , then go out and buy or rent this movie, and you are guaranteed to have a goodnight sleep !I guess they didn't know what to do with the money, so they made this, to annoy the movie fans, and to laugh at those who find this junk hilarious !",-1
3,"I really couldn't see it all at once, toked me 3 days...the thing that kept me seeing it was that at times humor was kinda nice and made me laugh but the fart things and some childish humor just toked it all away...and left me wonder why is Pat Morita there, was sad to see him in the movie...Lorenzo Lamas made me laugh imitating ""Antonio Bandanas"". Most are bad actors, the images are like a pure home made video...and by GOD the gayness of some jokes are really bad! O.o I can never(i think) give 1 out of 10 to a movie cause there's always some effort and some money and time spent doing one. So i give it 3/10 for the jokes that actually made me laugh.",-1
9,"I would only recommend seeing this show if you have a liking for kung-fu movies. The point is that it makes fun of low budget, classic kung fu shows. If you don't laugh and enjoy the bad acting and cheapness of martial arts movies, you won't enjoy this show. In the first 15 minutes of the movie, I was starting to wonder about where James Lew was going with this show, and if he could pull it off successfully. Once you figure out his style of humour, it's enjoyable. Maybe it's just because I have a big kung fu movie collection and I'm of Chinese descent... If you're a true martial arts movie lover, rent this movie.",1
1,"Going by the previous comment here I thought this movie would be comical exploration into the kung-fu world. What a mistake that was! The only laughs I got were at the expense of the acting and the script (if there even was a script, often it felt as though the entire movie was being ad-libbed by a first-year college movie class). Although there are numerous references to classic kung-fu movies, they don't come across as a tongue-in-cheek homage, but rather a pathetic attempt to legitimise the meaningless content. There are plenty of low brow jokes which only serve reinforce the weak script and poorly written characters, with nothing original or witty as a saving grace. A waste of time & money.",-1
1,"One of the worst movie I ever seen. Very bad acting, horrible script and the comedy is not funny. ""Fart fight"" that was awful. If you want to see a good KUNG FU comedy like ""Kung paw"" or ""KUNG FU hustle"" don't see this movie because is pathetic. I don't know why they did this movie. I rent it because Pat Morita and Lorenzo Lamas are in this movie but this actors don't help the movie, because is very bad. Maurice Patton was very non-original because he was imitating the good actor Chris Tucker. Maurice Patton was trying to talk, walk, move and express like Chris tucker, but was very non-original and pathetic. And James Lew is not funny very bad performance. Please don't waste your money buying it or rent it.",-1
3,"The idea of a mockumentary on creating a stereotypical low-budget martial arts movie is great. This movie definitely had some potential - some of Lew's lines on the aspects of these martial arts movies are great! But the whole thing is just too corny to be genuinely funny. Silly celebrity sound-alike names really take away from the celebrity impersonators (""Steven Seafood""? Why not just like, ""Steven Seagull,"" or just use his real name? I think laws on parody would have had them covered). Add to that very poor editing, with lines obviously recorded afterwards and edited in (they even overlap what the on screen character is saying) and a ""fart fight"" scene, and the whole thing just goes down the chutes.It's really unfortunate that some of the best scenes are in the trailer! It opened promisingly enough (""I'm Deadly Thug #1!"") but just couldn't keep up. Worth a rent maybe, but that's about it.",-1
1,"First off, I recorded this because the title and info given on the cable guide made this movie sound interesting--if not for a few laughs. I've never heard of this movie so I put it on in the background as I did some stationary chores. 20 minutes later, I deleted the stupid thing. This movie is horrible. The main character seemed like a washed out, more annoying Chris Tucker. At least Chris Tucker has some character. I'm Chinese, and I find some jokes about Chinese culture funny. The jokes in this movie were so bad it was offensive. I don't hate much in life, but I hate this movie and am somewhat shamed that I had recorded it.",-1
10,"This is one of those movies where the title does not give much information about the movie. I picked this up because the title seemed inane. I absolutely fell in love with the movie. I loved this movie from start to finish. Every once in a while, you need to watch a stupid movie just for the heck of it. This fits the bill. The Flatulence scene is one of the peak moments in this movie. I had to replay the scene two to three times just to catch it all because of how hard I was laughing. In fact, each time I watch this movie I repeat that scene several times, for the fact that laughing so hard I miss things, and because of how hilarious it is in the first place. This is a must view, if you love inane movies, or just need to relax!",1
8,"Now let me start out by saying this movie by no stretch of the imagination is a masterpiece, but it is much better than people seem to give it credit for. This is not a movie for the unobservant, if you need the joke to come up and smack you in the face you'll be bored. Some may wonder how anyone can say a movie with a ten minute fart joke could have subtle humor, but it does. The man that owns the Fortune Cookie company having a stereotypically Jewish name and later Ronald Mack(Maurice Patton) asking Mr. Lee(Pat Morita) if there's any Chinese Jews that bit was great and would have received huge laughs if it would have been slipped into an episode of Family Guy. But an example of the most subtle jokes and semi-racial(but they took shots at everyone so who cares) was placing Maurice Patton(who is African-American) directly in front of a Watermelon during the training scenes and makes you feel semi-guilty about laughing at it. Political correctness was very much the enemy of this film.James Lew did a great job poking fun at his career and the fact that despite being a huge cornerstone figure in martial arts cinema being practically unknown by fans of his work and the fact that a fair amount of his contributions have been uncredited. The jokes run the gambit from subtle to direct, a great movie for fans of Kung-Fu or for the highly observant who are not above laughing at a fart joke.",1
1,"This movie was so horrible I could barely even watch it all. I do not recommend this movie at all. The plot was horrible and the acting was just as bad. I really think they could have put more much needed time and effort into this movie. I think that if it was more of a movie and less of a documentary it would have gotten a better review from me. I seriously think this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. I try to watch movies that are not popular just to see what they are like, and most of them are not so great but this one was truly horrible. 1 out of 10.-",-1
1,"I really, really wanted to enjoy this movie but it just didn't seem to gel. A movie spoof is supposed to be funny, not make you sorry for the people appearing in it. Not to mention sorry for the people who financed it because you pray they can somehow make their money back and yet you know they probably won't. A movie lives and dies by it's script and for a comedy spoof this just wasn't very funny at all. And I agree with the 2 other people who said the ""fart fight"" featuring Lorenzo Lamas was the definite low point. Flatulence on film was funny when Mel Brooks did it in the classic ""Blazing Saddles"" but that was a long, long time ago. And how disappointing to see a film with the smoking hot Robin Shou and veteran Don ""The Dragon"" Wilson and neither one of them fights?? Just much too brief cameos for both, truly a shame. Might have helped things a bit here, at least there would have been some great fighting to make up for the lack of great comedy.",-1
5,"So the movie tries to give us an insight into the life (or after-life?) of those who have done porn movies. Depending on your viewing habbits, you may be able to recognize people involved here. But even if you never heard of them, the documentary tells you what they've done and where they went from there. A nice touch is the ending bit, where you get a ""where are they now""/""what are they doing now?"".Some of it seems a bit negative, but it just may have to do with the people that got selected. I do wonder if Jenna Jameson was asked to do that. Arguably one of the most famous ones, who also has retired (although she has shown privately that she has gone off the rails). Well if you don't count Pamela Anderson, who might have (unwillingly?) pioneered the celebrity Sex tape thing. So if you are interested what people go through, after their career this is the first one to watch ...",-1
5,"Let's be honest, most of us (blokes especially) have watched or been curious about pornography at least once (or many times). I remember seeing this documentary film, or one or two of its sequels, listed on Netflix, and I was interested to watch it, especially seeing adult stars I may recognise. Basically, the film explores what happens to the actresses and actors who have been in the adult industry, how and why they got into it, their experiences after leaving the industry, and whether it is possible to live a normal life following their exposure (fame, being nude, having sex onscreen, and everything else). Interviewed and sharing their experiences before, during and after being in porn are: Amber Lynn, Asia Carrera, Bobby Slayton, Crissy Moran, Houston, Mary Carey, Nina Hartley, Randy West, Raylene, Seka and Tyffany Million. Most of the stars left the industry to concentrate on a marriage or having children, turning to religion or politics (especially campaigning about the negative aspects of the industry), or just wanting to find themselves and do other things. All the stars talk about the positive aspects of the industry, from the fame (hanging out with other adult stars and celebrities), the fortune, and the experiences (sexual or not), including the changes that came in each decade (from softcore to hardcore magazines, cinema screenings, home video, the internet, and attitudes towards body types, ethnicities, tattoos, etc). They are also open about the negative things that come with being in pornography, including negative press, troubles with personal and public relationships, friendships, health problems, finding other employment, and knowing that whatever they do next, they cannot fully escape their past. You may be fascinated if you recognise the former adult stars talking about themselves, and even if you don't, this is a part of the multi-million business that perhaps not thought of as much, and it makes for some interesting stories. There are obviously parts of the film that will cause distress when they discuss the bad things that can happen going into an industry built around being naked and having sex onscreen, but it gives you a good insight into the people behind the flesh you have seen on video and on the internet, a reasonable documentary. Worth watching!",-1
7,"After Porn ends is an insightful and often poignant documentary that not only reveals the different paths chosen by those who have retired from the adult movie industry, but which also delves into their reasons for entering that particular career in the first place.Amongst those interviewed for the film:Tiffany Millions, the bounty hunter/investigator, who has gone from sucking dick to being a private dick. Raylene, the estate agent, who turned to selling houses instead of her body. Crissy Moran, the religious convert, who is still to be found on her knees, only now it's while praying to God. Randy West, the golfer, who went from shaving his balls to hitting them. Amber Lynn, the counsellor, who now gives advice instead of head. John Leslie, the artist—less vinegar strokes, more brush strokes. Houston, the nursing student, who swapped ATM for A&E.It's a wildly varying set of stories: some of the ex-pornstars seem to be thankful to the adult video industry for the money and opportunities that it afforded them, while others are clearly embarrassed or regretful about their past. Some of them entered the business out of choice, as a means of earning an easy wage, while others gravitated towards porn as the result of a difficult or abusive childhood. Some successfully stay out of porn, but others find it hard to say no forever. Whatever the case, it's interesting to see these people laying bare their souls instead of their bodies.6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.",1

5,"I have a love/hate relationship with the sex industry. I really don't get how screwing for money on video is legal, while screwing for money is illegal. It's very hypocrite type society law. It's weird that pornstar are sub-culture celebrities and prostitutes & johns are ostracized criminals in the US. In a country that support freedom, it's very weird in its limited in the definitions of those sexual freedoms. I think it's a man or woman right if she wants to get into the sex industry. Still, I don't think it's should be celebrated or people should be punish for it. Indeed, sex is healthy for adults, but too much sex or lack of it, isn't good for you. I really don't like the sex industry; when people are forced to join the sex industry against their will, acts upon violence, misandry & misogyny attitudes, careless of diseases, or target children. I just can't bared to watch it. Like it or not pornography is still a billion dollar industry. Sex sells. Like other modern media entertaining industry, it's slowly dying due to piracy and over market saturation. Its reasons like this, why a great deal of ex-pornstars at leaving the industry. Directed by Bryce Wagoner, the movie showcase a number of ex-pornstars after their own climax. Like any other type of work, retiring has its ups and downs. For these porn-stars, most of them, had a horrible job of adapting to life after porn due to the stigma of being the porn-industry. After all, it's rare that pornstar would be taken seriously in a serious job field. This is why no one looks seem acting in pornography as a legitimate career choice to put on a resume. While others, just cause their lives to get worst, by getting into drug or alcohol problem. If anything is to blame, it's their bad judgment and falling into vices. Yes, some of them were taking advantage of, but for the most of them. It was their call to go into it. There is few found any sense of success. The movie is not out to preach in either its favor or condemnation of having a porn industry, but it does tend to sway on focusing on the dark side of porn. The stories we hear varied from way depressing to watch, to just curiously. None of them were really that fun to hear talking. The only one that seem interesting was the pornstar that turn into a bounty hunter. The others interviewers lives are just too gloomy, mediocre, annoying or mundane. For a movie, that is supposed to be a movie after porn. They talk a great depth about how they got into porn, and what they did. The film-makers even need to overlay the audio from the interviews with some nude footage during the subjects' careers as if its fanfare so people wouldn't get bored. It's hard to take what they are saying about what they currently doing seriously, when the nude footage like the Houston 500 world-record breaking gangbang featuring 500 men making you spaced out when one of them are talking about her life with cancer. Are we really supposed to take the women that went to political activists or found God seriously after watching footage of her past fooling around? It's really hard to. Some of the footage seems really out of place, and the camera-work was lousy at times. Overall: Most of the interview felt like underdeveloped disorganized stories. It even dragged at times. Had the movie focused on, one direction, maybe the film could had work. Honestly, the movie does have a good compelling personal story if only it really dig deep and ask the tough questions. You really don't see that. The movie really needed a narrative. Some sense of storytelling with merit. Something to get us from point A to point B. It should be something like 2008's MTV documentary True Life: I'm addicted to porn about Jayden James or 2005's Inside Deep Throat about Linda Lovelace. Truly, indeed this is not a movie you could watch with your kids or parents. I was deeply surprised how much they didn't focus on. Like gay ex pornstars. Honestly, this movie would had at less, have one interview with one of them. Another one is more ethic ex- pornstars! I would had love to see how a black person or Hispanic is dealing with leaving porn. The movie could had also feature, life as an ex-pornstar while living in other countries. There are countless ex-pornstars in Italy, and Japan, alone. It would nice to see how strict, or sexual freedom, the politics are in those countries. The movie didn't even mention some of the biggest stars that the industry had. No mention of John Holmes, Traci Lords, Jenna Jameson, Linda Lovelace, Ron Jeremy and others was a letdown. In my opinion, the movie could had been told better.",-1
1,"Despite the provocative poster and provocative title, there's very little provocative material in here. For what you were actually expecting, I'd recommend Louis Theroux's documentaries on the subject. After Porn Ends seems content with the fact that porn stars have to exist after the cameras stop rolling, and after they retire; and as such, it meanders. There's no great sense of purpose or depth to any of the questions. Its more than a bit depressing, but not in a fascinating way like in Theroux's works. Having said all that, some of the stars are quite likable in small doses so I got some enjoyment out of that. Just not very much. 1/5",-1
5,"Before we start, a quick nit - why the ""Ends"" in the title, it doesn't add any understand-ability and it sounds more dramatic without it. Anyway, the documentary which covers precisely the material as advertised could easily have been a NPR ""Frontline"" installment except for the spliced in footage of the subjects' past lives. Kudos to Bryce Wagoner for using that footage both sparingly and as archival material rather than wallowing in it to raise the titillation factor of the film. Also kudos for a balanced presentation between ""actors"" who suffered from their prior involvement with those who profited from it and those for whom it was just something they did for a living in the past like selling insurance or bookkeeping. Of course, this does take some of heat out of the proceedings and the film does allow the audience's minds to wonder on several occasions particularly during extended interviews. Also, the subject is limited: of course, most former stars will go on to some of a normal life while others will hang on to the industry given a lack of other employment options. In short, a tidy but limited documentary.",-1
7,"If you've ever wondered what becomes of a porn actress once she is put out to pasture, AFTER PORN ENDS examines that very curiosity, and more than satisfactorily so.Moreover, the documentary helps to explain how it is some women end up working in the porn industry. For a few it's the fame that attracts them to the business; for the majority, however, it is strictly the money. I'm guessing none feel they are divinely called to this line of work, and with good reason.One learns that even the most popular of porn stars work only a few years in the biz. The industry simply isn't kind to cellulite, double chins, crow's-feet, liver spots, and the like. Rare is the actress who's over the hill and still performing. By thirty, most female porn stars have hung up their panties and have moved on to other attire.You may be wondering, what previous job skills and experience do these ladies possess that would look good on a resume or be impressive to one conducting a job interview? The good news is is that for most of these women they somehow manage to ease their way into the workforce and make the transition effortlessly, and are not entirely stigmatized for the remainder of their lives, if at all.Here we meet a former porn actress turned Christian activist. Three of the eleven subjects which the movie spotlights are men. One of them talks about the decision he made to become a porn actor over the life of a rabbi. Another among the eight, following her retirement from the industry, ended up running for governor of California and finished in tenth place. These are for the most part post-smut success stories. Far from landing up in the gutter, we're introduced to still other former porn actresses who would go onto become counselors, or real estate agents, or private detectives. No joke! (So much for their not being cut out for the daily grind.)AFTER PORN ENDS is tastefully presented (i.e. Non-explicit) and does not glamorize what is essentially in the eyes of many a degrading, loathsome industry. We learn, for instance, about the dysfunctional backgrounds a lot of these women had prior to their starring in pornos and how some of them were runaways. It is interesting that some of these women were discovered and approached by industry recruiters while at one time enrolled in modeling school or as contestants in beauty pageants. So sad that these women were brought down to the level of the demeaning sleazeball. Fortunately, their time spent in the industry was brief and for some was a regrettable experience. As with the one former actress who, upon exiting, started a foundation that helps to rescue women from the industry. 'Tis a case, in a sense, of what goes around.",1
6,"Changing careers is never easy, but it's even harder when your previous job includes starring in movies with titles like ""Sorority Sex Kittens 3"" and ""Backstage Sluts,"" and doing anal is listed as a special skill. Bryce Wagoner's documentary, ""After Porn Ends,"" interviews a variety of ex-porn stars to find out how they transitioned from adult video stardom to more mainstream lives. Real estate seems to be the preferred profession for a lot of them, though none of the women who went into that field—Houston, Raylene, Amber Lynn—stayed in it. Asia Carrera became a stay-at-home mom, while Crissy Moran and Shelley Lubben became born-again-Christians, renouncing their porn pasts. Self-employment is the easier path to building a life outside of porn: Randy West became a semi-pro golfer; the late John Leslie was a musician and painter (a pretty good one, too); and, perhaps the most interesting career switch, Tyffany Million (a.k.a. Sandra Margot) became a P.I. and bounty hunter. Seka is self-employed, but earns money from her website, capitalizing on her porn fame. Mary Carey used her porn notoriety to get some D-list recognition on reality shows and a couple publicity-grabbing runs for governor of California.Though ""After Porn Ends"" is fascinating, many of the stories start to sound alike. For the women, the narrative usually involves running away from an abusive family and battling drug and alcohol problems. For the men it's often a less complicated ""Can you believe they PAY ME to have sex with all these women?"" (Richard Pacheco recounts how he was contemplating studying to become a Rabbi when he was offered a part in a porn film. ""It wasn't a tough decision,"" he says.) Though a good number of the former sex stars are fairly well-grounded – notably Pacheco, Leslie, Seka, Million – there is, predictably, a lot of sadness here. The pain is not always explicitly detailed and seldom explored, but it's usually visible. Just look at the eyes. Lubben, whose videography is so scant it barely justifies her inclusion in this documentary, and Moran seem to have psychological scars that go beyond their porn careers—scars that a devotion to God hasn't fully healed. As porn legend Nina Hartley observes: ""A lot of people who are in porn have no business being in it."" Besides the always enjoyable Hartley (I regret that her response to suggestions she enter politics can't be quoted here), former porn blogger Luke Ford and adult industry fixture William Margold offer insight to the pitfalls of life after porn. One of those pitfalls, it seems, is dealing with men like Ford and Margold, both of whom make it clear they don't have a high opinion of women in the industry (men in the X-biz are cool, though). Ford refers to women in porn as ""prostitutes"" and ""hookers,"" and while starring in porn is similar, Ford's disdain is disingenuous. Margold at least acknowledges the hypocrisy of porn consumers looking down on adult video stars, but otherwise he's a Hawaiian shirt-wearing stereotype of a sleazy flesh peddler.Director Wagoner himself offers little insight, letting his subjects speak for themselves. On the surface this hands-off approach is a positive thing, preventing any moralizing or self-conscious sniggering, but there are several instances where I wished he'd asked follow-up questions, like when Lubben talks about how she and the man she eventually married got high on meth and discussed the bible(!), or when Mary Carey, the most vapid of the ex-porn stars, mentions that if she returned to porn she would, eventually, do a scene with a black man, seemingly implying an interracial scene is only a notch above gonzo porn.As other reviewers have mentioned, making a documentary about the lives of retired porn stars is so obvious it's amazing it hasn't been done before. Though Wagoner does a respectable job with ""After Porn Ends,"" it's hardly definitive. There's room for this subject to be done again.",1
4,"""After Porn Ends"" is a good example of, ""well it looked good on paper."" The idea of a documentary about former porn A-listers trying to survive in the real world after retirement from the industry is an excellent idea. In fact, that's the exact reason why I watched this doc from 2012. However, in reality, I'm disappointed that it didn't really tell me anything I didn't already know. That's just one of many issues I have with this doc.""After Porn Ends"" interviews the likes of Amber Lynn, Asia Carrera, Houston, Raylene, and also trail blazers Nina Hartley and Randy West, and many more ex-porn-industry A-listers (but no Ron Jeremy? WTF?). They tell their story in the first person, revealing their admiration's and hesitations about their past and current lives. They explain how and why they entered the industry and the feelings they experienced along they way. Take your best guess on how they answered these questions and you'll probably be right.Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Boogie Nights"" (1997) pretty much hits the nail right on the head about what it's like before, during and after the on-camera sex. What I learned from that movie already confirmed what I guessed to be true about the real porn world, making this documentary moot. Many porn stars made a lot of money when times were good, but a lot of them blew the money on drugs and alcohol, ended up broke and/or in trouble, had a hard time keeping a stable home life, and eventually returned to porn to make ends meet. Some of the women were tricked into it, and some were sexually abused as children, and some felt that sex was the same as love and that's why they stayed. Some have no employable skills at all, could never work a 9-to-5 job, and/or are avoided like the plague because of their porn industry dealings. That's pretty much the gist of this doc....and Boogie Nights: art imitating life imitating art. ""Boogie Nights"" is more entertaining, though. Watch that instead.""After Porn Ends"" has the look and feel of a quickly-put-together-film-school-project. Swish-pans and quick-zooms that look like the editor forgot to cover them up with B-roll. Actually, considering the amount of material these porn stars shot in their lifetime, I was expecting a lot more B-roll and less talking-head. If you need to have a 45-second clip of someone talking, fine, just make sure you have 40-seconds of interesting visuals to cover that. You learn that in your first year of film school.What I found the most interesting were the scholars talking about the psychological affect the industry has on both porn-stars and viewers, and how being an adult film star (current or former) will follow you everywhere until your death. Like the mafia, ""you are never really out."" Although, even that, I pretty much knew already because whether you're a porn star or not, thanks to the internet, your history is never really history. I know, right, tell you something you didn't already know.",-1
7,"This documentary is a great look at the effects of working in the porn industry , but you do need to take some of what is said with a certain amount of salt.Shelley Lubben, for example, is clearly unhinged and almost everything that she says in this (and in interviews in other places) is at best a distortion of the truth. She was severely mentally ill and worked as a prostitute for several years before working in porn, but somehow the porn industry ruined her life. Yeah...Anyway, it's a great look at the industry, and one thing that really stuck with me is that it's difficult to tell in some cases whether or not the person was damaged by the industry or if they were already carrying scars from earlier events in their lives.",1
1,"Ok I watched 20 minutes of it and turn it off, Netflix has another show on porn documentary called ""Hot girls wanted"" this is great this After porn ends will show you women past their prime and old guys, I mean I am sure guys want to see women only but is not an interesting story who cares what this people do after porn, I am sure they will make a sequel called After porn Ends elderly porn stars, skip this one is horrible, director go for the hot young chicks next time far more interesting.",-1
7,"The stories are the stories of people. People being people living their lives and making choices. Porn, a variation on the ancient profession, was their vehicle. Even confirmed more by historian, Margold, of the trend toward escort today. Nina shed the most wisdom about actors in the industry. Rightly so, since she of anyone would know. Dr. Malamuth shared some facts of what little air time he had. Ford, the writer, explained them as broken and turbulent souls twisting and turning. I didn't find them to be all broken. Who isn't a turbulent soul twisting and turning in life? Worth a view if you wish to know the person behind the illusion.",1
5,"I am fascinated by this topic. We have seen the impact of the porn industry on people portrayed in fiction (Boogie Nights, Orgazmo, Lovelace) as well as in other documentary works by Louis Theroux and trashy, exploitative British TV docos. How people interact with the most popular and sought after taboo in the world is always interesting. ""Life After Porn"", however, doesn't capitalise on its' premise as well as it should. Positives: The biggest issue when tackling a controversial subject is the potential biases of the film-makers, yet in ""After Porn Ends"", the people behind the scenes never use their movie as propaganda, or a political tool on either end of the partisan spectrum. I wouldn't be surprised either way if the director and producers were pro or anti-porn. It offers an impartial glimpse into the motivations of a smorgasbord of characters from different aspects and eras of the pornography industry. There are subjects who had positive childhoods, negative childhoods, good parents and bad, loved the work, and those who hated it. By being objective and showing such a wide selection of experiences, the film is showing us that this industry is just like any other in many respects, that your attitude is the key factor in determining your outlook. The equitable framing of all opinions allows audiences to make up their own minds and while you, the viewer, will find your own opinions represented in this doco, maybe you'll see a story that changes your mind, or challenges your previous misconceptions. So it is a film I would recommend on that basis, to contemplate all sides of this complicated commercial enterprise. Negatives: Most of the flaws are technical. The cinematography is flat-out dull and ugly most of the time, there is no visual flair, and the shots are often shaky and incorporate unnecessary snap-zooms. The music is also completely forgettable, to the point it feels like stock, free-from-YouTube material. There is however a nice little cover of 'The Velvet Undergrounds's ""Sweet Jane"" during the credits. Easily the worst technical shortcoming was the editing. They clearly needed to shoot with another camera in order to cut away the awkward jump cuts, awkward zoom ins, and to allow the interviews to flow better. There are moments where one person will be interviewed sitting down, CUT to them answering another question in a different location, then CUTting straight back to the initial interview location. It's jarring and makes the production feel so cheap and cookie-cutter. ""After Porn Ends"" only truly examines the life of a retired pornstar in the last act, which comes off a little like false advertising. I wish the film-makers had followed a newly retired star on their journey to reconnect with the outside world. However, we simply receive a standard, talking heads documentary with no distinguishing features that makes it remarkable. Conclusion: You can make up your own mind about whether you want to see this based on my review. It's a good starting point for anyone keen to learn about the business and its' varying effects on individuals. I was never bored, and it's pretty short with one or two sobering moments, and a few compelling interviewees. You can find it on Netflix, or on other internet platforms.Thanks for reading :) 5/10",-1
7,"I think 'After Porn Ends' brings to light a prudent question: what those who make their living in the porn business do after... after... they finish it? Well, the movie tells us that not everybody in this field really stops for good; even the actresses, who are most requested in their early twenties or so, they can continue working in parallel or do something-porn-related when they get older. The main thing, according to the film, is that these people live in their own world when they are into this. The parties, the drugs, the trips, they're all consequences of this chosen life. You might raise the question: 'But why did they choose this kind of life?' a psychologist says that most of them see this as an only opportunity to be somebody, somehow; to escape from their own lives, usually a life of struggles, with financial difficulties; not to mention that some of them (I guess a small part, since the movie didn't delve into that much) were molested by parents or adults when kids. It's interesting to see some ex-porn stars doing something far different now. What seems they cannot run away is from being, to some extent, judged by other people in a moment somebody finds out on the Internet that this very person used to make a living by sucking a bunch of cocks, for example. I don't know,but those who left this industry behind seem to resent that they were part of it someday. The feeling is normally of shame and what's worse, they didn't get rich as they guessed. The film does a good job showing these people expressing their opinions. I just thought that it could go further on the psychological analysis - the psychologist speaks for less than a minute or two in the whole movie, while some ex-stars don't have, let's say, something too enlightening to say.",1
2,"The subject could be interesting if they knew how to direct, edit and film. It's hard to see such a miserable image, with focused background and out of focus people talking to the camera.",-1
2,"This is a laughable attempt at a documentary covering life after the porn business. You have only to look at the list of actors featured to realise that very little room is given to those who were okay with the porn business, and lots of room was given to those who hated it. Nina Hartley, who should have been the centre of this documentary, hardly gets a word in, while the anti-porn crusaders Shelley Lubben and Crissy Moran together cover approximately a third of this ""documentary"". Of course, their lives were ruined long before porn, but that is basically passed over here, and all the attention is given to how they suffered while making porn, or after they were done with it.Religion is heavily featured here, and presented as the saviour. Even Asia Carrera, who did not complain about her time, and who is an atheist, still decided to live in Mormon Country, but it was not religion who helped her when her husband died and she had a ton of bills to pay; it was her porn fans.The person basically telling the story here, narrating the documentary, is Luke Ford, who made his living for many years writing for gossip columns and making up stories for a living. He was sued more than most tabloid journalists of his age, and yet, he is the storyteller granted the most time in this documentary, even though he has no connections whatsoever with the adult industry. For that reason alone, this ""documentary"" should be disqualified from that genre.",-1
9,"Well, the title of my review already says it. Nothing much to add. I just don't understand why people would rate this badly. This movies just hears the people involved and tell their story. The person that rated this badly most probably has issues, conflicts, hipocrisies and certainly a lot of prejudices. This is certainly a terapeutic movie, for our sexuality and our preconceived (and mostly wrong) notions about sex, sexuality and pornography in our society and in our behaviour/interaction with those matters.",1
3,"I understand why these women did porn. They are boring as poop otherwise. I feel it isn't fair. Tell the other side of the story. How porn creates jobs. This was probably the least interesting documentary I've ever seen. It did, however, motivate me to go back to watching porn hub. #sad.",-1
10,"Entertaining presentation and an interesting topic, I wonder why this movie wasn't made 20 years ago.I'm not a consumer of mainstream adult content, so I did not recognize the interviewees, however I was surprised at how easy it was to identify with them and understand the challenges that they face after they move on.I'm a fan of documentaries, so I'm biased toward the format, but Exxxit held my interest from beginning to end. In fact, I would like to see more work analyzing this industry, exactly because it is so unique and interesting.Two thumbs up.",1
6,"I found the topic interesting and think it was great that someone finally did a somewhat better job at the topic. It was very passive voice, no questions were asked, there were no interviews, just subjects talking, telling the story. Which was very humanizing but not as informative. I wonder why all the men subjects had been out of porn for so long. Surely there are younger men who have left porn. The industry has changed a lot. Thought their experiences weren't quite as relevant. Of course the bottom line is.....can you ever get a handle on how porn performers really feel about what they do or did? Would they tell the whole truth even if they could?",1
1,"The plot was lousy and the persons talking seemed stilted and didn't know the subject. If some proper actors were used instead of amateurs it might have been enjoyable to watch. A low budget hard to watch documentary about a subject that has been done before by better producers. Is very similar to after and before prostitution and would have been better with a little more research.As other reviewers have mentioned, making a documentary about the lives of retired porn stars is so obvious it's amazing it hasn't been done before. Though Wagoner does a respectable job with ""After Porn Ends,"" it's hardly definitive. There's room for this subject to be done again.",-1
8,"Here is a very unique story that had all the makings of a fine mystery novel but was played as a western theme making for an entertaining watch for the series.It starts as Jeff and Kate Kinsman are in town to pick up supplies. We then see a fairly handsome man, Dolliver, enter the General Store. Kate gets off the wagon and goes inside the store only to return and tell her husband that the handsome Dolliver was coming on to her. A near fight breaks out between Jeff and Dolliver before Marshal Dillon is able to break it up and send the people on their own way.A day later, Kate comes into town and advises that her husband has been shot and killed by the sweet talking Dolliver. Matt goes out to investigate but does not have enough evidence to arrest. Now Kate feels bad for the murder since it was her fault the two men were fighting. But Matt believes there is more to this murder than meets the eye.This was an interesting story when someone thinks more of themselves than is really possible. Florence MacMichael was a nice pick to play the homely Ms Kinsman and of course John Anderson, as Dolliver, always plays his character to perfection. A wonderful acted episode that was a entertaining to watch.",1
7,"Not much suspense on who the killer is in this one, but Florence MacMichael as Kate, in her only Gunsmoke appearance, plays a very manipulative woman who must have guys fight over her. She plays the role well. The title of the episode also gives away who the killer is but it was a nice journey on how Dillon figured it out and caught her. I wonder if she got hung? Highlights of the episode:Chester getting himself all hot and bothered talking about food. Just hilarious!Dillon, not known for making jokes, good ones anyway, had a good one telling Miss Kitty she gets confused on cloudy days when drinking before nighttime.How was Dillon so sure Kate would not shoot him in the end? Chester was not armed and she could've killed both of them and got away with it. Who would've believed she could get the better of the Marshal? It annoys me when I see Dillon act so careless like that, because in real life he would've never survived 20 years letting someone point a loaded rifle at him without his gun drawn.",1
10,"I love Disney and do like good disco music that you can dance and tap your feet to. Seeing the super 8mm film on Youtube, I was blown away, I do remember having an audio CD of the songs and other ones too(which has been since lost), but watching this brought back so many memories. The animation, made up of clips from the likes of Symphony Hour and Mickey's Birthday Party, while not the best in terms of picture quality, is nonetheless colourful and fluid and edited very well in the five songs. Mickey Mouse Disco and Macho Duck are especially good in this regard. The music is irresistibly catchy, the exuberant melodies and enthusiastic vocals really do make you want to get up and dance and if not that it is certainly toe/foot-tapping-stuff. Welcome to Rio is full of that carnival celebratory feeling. The characters are a delight to see, Mickey, Donald and Goofy are all here and shine in their segments, as do Daisy in Macho Duck and Clara Cluck in Welcome to Rio. Overall, if you love Disney and disco Mickey Mouse Disco is a dream come true. 10/10 Bethany Cox",1
10,"It might sound strange to you, whether you're old or young it doesn't matter (the older ones will get this reference while any kids reading this will be like 'huh, what'?) but as a kid I a) remember watching this (and possibly blocked it out, sort of), and b) confused it with ""Disco Duck."" Remember that horrible novelty song that somehow became a hit single? It was like the planets aligned and some weird God appeared and said 'Let there be DISCO DUCK, and people will listen to it, briefly, and then torch it and put it in the giant dumpster fire that the rest of disco will go into.' But the point is, for the longest time I actually thought THIS was what people meant when they brought up the song 'Disco Duck' because I never actually heard the song, only this clip-show of songs.But why am I going on this tangent? Oh, because there's not too much to say here: Disco finally seeped in to the walls of Walt Disney animation studios and, as I suppose any of the remaining Nine Old Men from the classic era were working on The Black Cauldron or Fox and the Hound or whichever, there needed to be something quick and slapped together to appease the (then waning) craze for disco, so this was made. This is a CLIP SHOW, not anything newly animated, and the credited directors somehow include people who had already either retired or died by 1980 (Jack King, Ben Sharpsteen for example) from classic cartoons (it's hard not to recognize Thru the Mirror since it's one of the greatest shorts of all time, nevermind Disney).In other words, this 10/10 is mostly meant as a kind of ironic rating; this is a trashy little piece of product that was thrown out there for some reason or another, and yet I'm sure it lit up many fans (as it probably did for me) when it was out there with copies of The Black Hole on VHS in the 80's. You can now see it on YouTube in all its cocaine-drenched glory.",1

4,"""Polaroid"" is a Norwegian 16-minute live action short film from 2015, so almost 5 years old now and this one was directed and written by Lars Klevberg and it was his final work before he, after a break of several years, moved on to full feature filmmaking. Actually, this transition also includes a recently released long version of this short or at least a long movie that is based on this short film. Still, this is not the main reason why Klevberg and this short are getting some attention now. the key reason is that he is the man in charge of directing the newest Child's Play. I hope he improved a bit over the years as I found this one we got here fairly generic and unimpressive. There is one key aspect that is of course closely linked to photography and that you may see very scary and unexpected things on photographs that weren't there when you took the photo or at least you thought so. They are also making use of the idea that it takes a little while for a photo to develop and the gray color to disappear, so they build up a bit of suspense there. Also there is a lot of shadow (and light) play in here. Nonetheless, I felt that this film dragged a bit, way more than it should given the already rather low running time. And I am not sure if it was the bestg idea to turn this into a full feature film. I think from the quick glimpse I had at the imdb rating, the reception was not too strong. Anyway, back to this one here: It is the story of two young women who are best friends and the scary events happening to them one night. No need to go much deeper into detail as all you see is pretty predictable and expected. No fresh glimpses or moments really. Good thing is there is virtually no dialogue in here, so even if you aren't speaking Norwegian, then no need to look for subtitles. But my suggestion is to skip the watch altogether unless you are a huge fan of the actress who is almost named Loch Ness (haha what's up with that) and who enjoyed also a bit of an international breakthrough recently, the other one not so much. Thumbs-down. Watch something else instead.",-1

Big Worm wants his $200 and threatens to kill both Craig and Smokey. Deebo is the giant bully of the neighborhood.This is a fun slice of ghetto life. It's a cross of ridiculous and hard. The movie is a fun watch with Tucker joking around. Then the movie takes another step up. When Craig's father catches him with a gun, he tells him that his fists are all he ever needs. That's a big scene. It's also surprising since the father is played as a joke at the beginning. That scene makes this a better movie than a simple weed comedy.",1

9,"The movie that introduced me to Chris Tucker casts him and Ice Cube as a pair of ghetto guys trying to bum their way through life. ""Friday"" manages to keep the perfect balance of serious look at the grimness of a ghetto existence, and hilarious gag-fest. Much of the movie has the two friends getting high while trying to think of how to pay a drug dealer $200 by 10 pm. But there's just a lot of really funny stuff every step of the way. You're sure to love it. Because I'm not just f**king with you.Also starring Nia Long, Tommy Lister Jr, John Witherspoon, Anna Maria Horsford, Regina King, Tony Cox, Bernie Mac, Lawanda Page (Aunt Esther on ""Sanford and Son"") and a brief appearance by Michael Clarke Duncan.

8,"(Re-review in 2015): It's interesting to see how this has been labeled the first ""Hood"" comedy. I'm sure there have been others - though written by, of all people, Joel Schumacher, I've always thought of 1976's Car Wash as the grand-daddy of them. It's also become a benchmark for stoners; for the 20th anniversary, it was screened for a special event on 4/20. Sadly, I couldn't attend full of the green stuff, but it was still an enjoyable experience seeing it again. Not great, but good.For all of the comparisons to it being Boyz N tha Hood as a crude comedy, that it is in part. But it's also like the Watts equivalent of something closer Clerks, also by first-time filmmakers: it's mostly about two guys who don't have much going on with their lives or prospects or action, but they're surrounded by so many 'lively' personalities and moments that are meant to get BIG laughs, regardless of a story structure that is super-strong outside of the Day-In-The-Life thing. And both borrow of course from Do the Right Thing, though Cube actually goes for his own version of the violent climax with a fight. The lack of any cops shows this is a fairly insulated world. Works for me.If it doesn't really have the same existential heft as Clerks, well, it's not fully trying to be that anyway. What we get here also, of course, is the breakthrough for Chris Tucker - an opportunity he'd only really pursue for another few years before spending his life, it appears, on Rush Hour checks (and a surprise guest spot in Silver Linings Playbook, of all things). His work here is still electrifying and high-charged, though maybe this time I saw more of the obvious ""tics"" of the character (like, we get it, the Angel Dust bit is one of the major highlights of the movie, but can't you move on?) And Cube is good as straight man for Tucker's foole, and has a few moments too.This is one of those movies I watched a LOT 'back in the day' as one might say. It's really a movie, despite being rated R, for 13 year olds, black or white, and seeing it at 13 made as big an impression as seeing Clerks or Pulp Fiction or whatever. At the time I thought it was that good on the level. But some things do last better than others, and the seams in Friday show much more over time. Some bits don't work - the crackhead (?) hustler is hit or miss, mostly great in the ""HEY, SMOKY BACk HERE TAKING A S***!"" bit - though Tony Lister, DEEBO of course in capital letters, is still amazing. And I found myself laughing often through the film, in part due to things still working, like anything with Bernie Mac (and Tony Cox!), and sometimes just nostalgia. It surprised me just how much I remembered in terms of dialog - if only I remembered everything from school like this, I'd be probably a smarter man today... oh well.Bottom line, enough of it holds up to recommend as a fun comedy, but the effect of 20 years of stoner/hood/black comedies have diluted some of its effectiveness; any time Craig narrated, or that quick montage of 'things that happened today' right before the fight, drag the movie down. And why do they go OUTSIDE knowing that the drive-by is going to happen? That they might shoot the houses whether or not they're there? Doesn't make sense.Maybe I'm putting too much thought into it here. But, for what it was, and is, it's fun, dirty stuff.",1
7,"Here, co-writer / co-executive producer / star Ice Cube does an ingratiating job of portraying the lighter side of life in the 'hood. He plays Craig Jones, a tough but amiable youth who spends an eventful Friday with his best bud Smokey (Chris Tucker). Craig has just been fired from his job (on his day off, no less), and his old man (John Witherspoon) pressures him to find another one. Craig and Smokey must deal with a neighbourhood bully named Deebo (Tommy 'Tiny' Lister), and when Smokey lives up to his name and uses up all of the product of a local dealer (Faizon Love), he will have to cough up $200 to the man, or *else*.Lots of bright and engaging characters bring life to these proceedings. Cube is good in the lead role (it's a comic highlight when he smokes some weed and trips), and comedian Tucker shines in one of his better movie roles. Witherspoon is hilarious, and also poignant as he attempts to teach Craig about being a man without resorting to the use of a firearm. The dialogue has some great lines, without falling back on an over-abundance of F-bombs, and the movie does get fairly serious but never gets particularly grim. The viewer does feel a certain satisfaction when Craig stands up to Deebo at the end, solving more than one problem in the process. A bunch of familiar faces play area residents: Nia Long (radiant as always), Anna Maria Horsford, Bernie Mac, Regina King, Paula Jai Parker, Tony Cox, etc. That's co-writer DJ Pooh as the character Red, recipient of a memorable shiner.A pleasant movie to watch on any day of the week, this was followed by ""Next Friday"" and ""Friday After Next"".Seven out of 10.",1
7,"It is Friday and Craig Jones (Ice Cube) is unemployed, having, yesterday, been fired. He is lounging around his house with his friend Smokey (Chris Tucker), a rather incompetent weed dealer. Smokey's problem is that he tends to smoke, rather than sell, his product. This has lead to trouble with Smokey's supplier, Big Worm, who now wants his money, or his product back, or Smokey is a dead man. Then there's Deebo, the local bully, plus Craig's jealous, psychotic girlfriend, Joi, and Debbie, the neighbour Craig has a crush on. A lot can happen while lounging around your house on a Friday.Good fun. The first movie written by Ice Cube, of NWA fame, and the first movie directed by F Gary Gray, who would go on to direct Straight Outta Compton, the movie on NWA. Pretty funny, with a nice relaxed sort of feel.Some good themes towards the end, especially the anti-gun violence stance.Solid performances all round. Ice Cube and Chris Tucker make a good combination - Tucker as the over-the-top, extroverted Smokey and Ice Cube as the more straight-playing Craig.",1

9,"F. Gary Gray has made a sweet touching hood film if that makes any sense. A comedy-drama take on the life of two jobless African Americans who basically sit on the porch all day and discuss modern day tactics. My kinda movie.The film is about Craig Jones (Ice Cube) a crabby jobless ""two cool for school"" type kid and his drug-dealing best friend Smokey (Chris Tucker) sit on the porch all day, thinking it will be an easy day in the hood. When really it will be a life or death type day.The neighborhood bully Debo (Tom Lister, Jr.) harasses them and says they have to pay him $200 by nightfall or they ""will not live to see Saturday."" Friday is a sweet movie, it his hilarious in most parts. And is loaded with dialogue. Its the kinda movie you watch and chill out too. The dialogue is actually pretty well written. Ice Cube and DJ Pooh provided a script. From two small names in the film industry at the time, they didn't do bad.I too like the sequels of Friday, and find them true to the original. Mainly ""Friday After Next"" is my favorite of the franchise. I hope F. Gary Gray and Chris Tucker return to do one last Friday. Maybe this time they will move on to Saturday.Starring: Ice Cube, Chris Tucker, Tommy Lister Jr., Nia Long, Bernie Mac, and John Witherspoon. Directed by: F. Gary Gray.",1
7,"My sister lent me this movie and told me how funny it was. I even told her that I'm not really into those ghetto type of comedies, that it's a bit racist or stereotype, she's the same way too, but she said that I simply had to see this movie. If I loved Chris Tucker that I should definitely enjoy this movie.Well, I have to admit that I got more than a few laughs during this film. Especially from Chris Tucker and Ice Cube, they made a great comedic team. Basically, they owe a drug dealer $200.00 and they owe it by Saturday. The problem is that Ice Cube just lost his job and Chris never really had a job. Ice Cube also has a girl who has a major crush on him and he likes her back, but he also has a bit of a jealous girl who is after any girl who likes her man. The funniest scene in this movie, even though it is kind of insulting, is Chris's blind date with ""Janet Jackson"". His reaction is priceless.You'll have to see the movie to understand what I'm saying. So actually I would recommend this movie, unless you are highly sensitive. But still, just let go and have fun, you can do that easily with Chris Tucker's brilliant comedy.7/10",1

7,"'Friday (1995)', a classic hang-out comedy, hits many of the same beats as Singleton's 'Boyz n The Hood (1991)' but does so in a much more laid-back, generally affable way. Its underlying social issues are still explored but they're viewed through a comedic lens, acting as somewhat sobering counterpoints to the picture's prevalent absurdity. With wacky characters, strange situations and a tangible sense of place, the piece keeps you engaged with its simple story of a couple of dudes just trying to make it to the weekend. It isn't overly complex; Cube's recently wrongfully-fired Craig and Tucker's whiny, weed-obsessed Smokey more-or-less spend the entire movie on the former's front porch. Regardless of this, the flick remains compelling throughout. More importantly, it's often funny. It doesn't have a ton of staying power, but its best jokes do stick in your memory after its credits have rolled. Despite a few outdated attitudes, it's a fun time throughout. 7/10",1

There are others but that is only in the first 8 minutes.The cast is perfect, and they even have some oldies from Sanford and Sons. It really is an all star cast.Most of the movie takes place in one house, on one porch, or within the neighbors front lawn, making the movie compact and quick paced. There is a lot of violence, suggestive sex, drugs, shooting, fist fights, and other bad things so this isn't for your average family, no children.",1
10,"1995's ""Friday"" is one of the best comedies to feature an entirely black cast of actors from the '90s. ""Friday"" has been a long-time personal favorite of mine since about 1999 - four years after this film's original 1995 theatrical release and just one year before the release of its sequel ""Next Friday"" (2000).Following in the footsteps of neo-blaxploitation 'hood movies from the early '90s, ""Friday"" is somewhat of a parody of films such as ""Boyz N the Hood"" (1991) and ""Menace II Society"" (1993), but with a Cheech & Chong-styled, urban stoner twist. It comes in between the seriousness of ""Boyz"" and ""Menace"" (but before the 'hood-movie silliness of 1996's ""Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood"") and the PC 21st-century preachiness of Tyler Perry. But that doesn't mean that ""Friday"" still isn't saying SOMETHING meaningful. In its own unique, un-preachy way, ""Friday"" critiques the (still-relevant) epidemic of unemployment in the black community while also throwing wickedly pointed barbs at U.S. drug laws (particularly as they pertain to marijuana).A Lot Can And Does Go Down Between Thursday And Saturday in ""Friday,"" which marked the big-screen debut of former music video director F. Gary Gray. On one particularly eventful Friday in South Central Los Angeles, recently unemployed Craig Jones (rapper Ice Cube) wakes up with no job, nowhere to go, and nothing to do. The plot is pretty thin as he and best bud Smokey (hilarious Chris Tucker) observe the goings-on in their neighborhood and all of the film's colorful cast of neighborhood characters. Things get really going when Smokey suddenly becomes indebted to local drug dealer Big Worm (Faizon Love) for $200 after smoking up the same merchandise that he was supposed to be selling, which also leads to a violent ending confrontation with towering neighborhood bully Deebo (Tiny ""Zeus"" Lister, Jr.).""Friday"" really does breeze through its plot and characters and does so with a funny, laugh-a-minute script penned by none other than Ice Cube himself and co-screenwriter DJ Pooh (who also appears in the film as Craig's co-worker Red). Chris Tucker's Smokey seems to get the best laughs and one-liners here. With his nasal, high-pitched voice and manic mannerisms, he proves to be a reliable comic foil to Ice Cube's more level-headed Everyman Craig and is the film's comedic centerpiece. John Witherspoon brings a seasoned maturity to his role as Craig's Dad, a hilarious cameo by the late Bernic Mac as Pastor Clever is perfectly timed, and Nia Long livens up any scene she appears as the girl next door Debbie.Since F. Gary Gray is a former music video director making his big debut here, the movie does also have a wonderful hip-hop/'70s soul soundtrack that features Ice Cube himself, Dr. Dre (still riding high at the time on the popularity of his trademarked ""G""-funk sound), Cypress Hill, Scarface (of Geto Boys), Mack 10 and 2 Live Crew, plus old-school funk/R & B talents such as the late Rick James, Bootsy Collins & Bernie Worrell, and The Isley Brothers. Such a selection of artists proves he knows his black music very well.10/10",1
7,"It was only a matter of time before I saw this considering my recent obsession with anything that has that Ghetto zeitgeist. NWA helped during a tough period in my life and this got mentioned in ""The Boondocks"" a lot so of course, see it I did.Well that local color (no pun intended) is there in buckets and so far as this white boy can tell it feels pretty authentic of the quite desperation a certain socioeconomic community lives in where violence always lies somewhere beneath the surface and it's hard to not just give into the herb.Ice Cube has all the sass and vigor of his rap videos while still commanding a lot of empathy. A lot of the dialogue exchanges radiate subtle frustration and antagonism from that of a father and son and also of between the sexes. Seriously, even the smart girl says sexist stuff but that's the culture (I guess).It's an episodic and breezy story in limited time and space that serves as a microcosm of the lives that so many must live but which we usually only glimpse through the glamorous haze of a rap video.One curious thing about it is the bizarre lack of urgency. Maybe that's the point, I don't know but even with impending death they're pretty chill about everything.Also I noticed that there are no white people in it. That made me feel a lot less guilty for a bit.",1
6,"Chris Tucker pretty much makes this movie. Ice Cube is literally a block of wood for an hour and a half, so nothing new there. But this film has a cult following, mainly thanks to Tucker. What I find ironic is how this film has an anti-gun message when Ice Cube made his money off of glorifying gun violence. Ice Cube must have been indirectly connected to thousands of murders by helping to originate and popularize gangster rap. Not that I don't enjoy listening to it but let us be real here, gangster rappers could have rapped about doing their income tax as long as they sounded good and kept sampling beats from the 60s/70s but whatever. Ice Cube sold out his own people for a paycheck. Yeah sure, you can play devil's advocate and claim they rap about inner city life and extra; but soul music did that back in the 70s without glorifying killing people, selling drugs and disrespecting women. And we all know Dr Dre was as much of a gangster as Mickey Mouse. Some goes for Ice Cube, I'm guessing. The only semi-gangster out of their lot was Easy-E and he was a second rate dealer. But I do have to say this about Ice Cube and his friends, they gave a lot back to their old neighborhoods, oh wait they didn't. And look at the movies Ice Cube makes, they all su&k. But I'm reviewing a cult classic here and I have to say it is okay. Chris Tucker makes the film. Ice Cube shouldn't be allowed in front of a camera but Hollywood loves a sellout so we keep getting him. I can just imagine some evil Hollywood big wigs getting off on the fact Ice Cube is their little whatever. I'm over it.",1

He got beat up at the end!  That was actaully a very dramatic fight scene.  All in all, I loved this movie so much that I bought it!  Next Friday was funny to!  But it didn't have Chris Tucker.  This movie is one of my all time favorites!",1
3,"So, let me get this straight, this classic 90s comedy that I've heard people talk about for decades is literally just two stoners sitting on a porch for 90 minutes? Boy, I did not get Friday at all. I suppose there's a semblance of a plot, because Chris Tucker has smoked too much of the weed he was meant to sell so they need to gather $200 before the end of the day. I also recognize that I'm exaggerating about the whole movie being planted on that porch, but there doesn't feel like much movement in the story, and they are constantly coming back to that porch as a sort of homebase. I think my big problem was that I didn't care about any of the things that they were doing. These idiots get themselves into a stupid situation, so it's hard for me to sympathize with the journey they take to get out of it.Perhaps I could get over my disinterest in the plot if I was laughing, but the humor also fell flat for me. Occasionally there would be a line delivery or a reaction shot that would get me to chuckle, but by and large, I wasn't even cracking a smile. I suppose there must be some disconnect since I'm not in the ""target demographic,"" but I think true comedy should work no matter your age, race, gender, or any other factor like that. However, comedy is ridiculously subjective, so I'm sure there are plenty of people who find this stuff hilarious and would scoff at what I consider ""true comedy."" I wasn't a huge fan of the way Friday casually handles violence, because it doesn't seem like something that should be taken lightly. There were minor moments or scenes in Friday that I found engaging, but most of the way through it felt like a colossal waste of time.",-1
10,"When I was 14, I first saw Friday and almost choked from laughter. The script by Ice Cube and DJ Pooh is right on target with it's ghetto humor. Another plus point for the film is it doesn't stereotype. But it's Chris Tucker as Smokey who makes this film. His high pitched voice and mannerisms are classic.Hard-core rapper Ice Cube, after appearing in such hard-hitting films as Boyz 'N the Hood and Higher Learning, played his first comic role in this picture he co-wrote with frequent musical collaborator DJ Pooh. Craig (Ice Cube) manages to get fired on his day off (though he claims it's through no fault of his own) and spends the day hanging out with his buddy Smokey (Chris Tucker) and trying to avoid his father (John Witherspoon), who wants him to find another job immediately. Smokey (whose name might have something to do with his tremendous fondness for marijuana) has even more serious problems; he was given $200 worth of weed to sell by Big Worm (Faizon Love), but he ended up smoking it instead, and if he can't come up with the money by the end of the day, he'll be in a world of hurt (and will put Craig in the same place just for being his friend). And Deebo (Tom ""Tiny"" Lister, Jr.), a gargantuan bully who roams the neighborhood on his bicycle, has it in for Craig, while Craig tries his best just to stay out of his way. As one would expect, Friday features a strong hip-hop soundtrack, featuring tracks by such artists as Dr. Dre, Cypress Hill, Mack 10, and Funkdoobiest, as well as old-school R&B selections from The Isley Brothers, Roger, and Rose Royce",1
7,"I'm glad this movie received a cult following, because it really is a very funny comedy that simply shouldn't be analyzed.  A plot doesn't exist, nor is this a character-driven vehicle, but it's a wild ride from start to finish.  Most of the help comes from the supporting characters.  Of course, Chris Tucker steals the show with his landmark role as ultra-pothead Smokey. Tucker has that unrelenting comic energy that only a comedian of supreme talent can possess.  Even when the film falls flat, he picks you back up.  I also have to commend John Witherspoon, as Ice Cube's father.  I loved him on ""The Wayans Bros."" and I loved him in this movie.  Though I was laughing most of the time, the gags are indeed crude--very crude.  And sometimes that crudeness just wears out.  Luckily, it's not too often, and there are some memorable lines and memorable moments in ""Friday.""  I have this movie in my video collection, and I can always fish it out when in search for a good laugh.",1
7,"My first exposure to the Hardy Boys came courtesy of this serial from the Mickey Mouse Club. It was after seeing this that I bought a load of the Hardy Boys kids novels to read. Those two certainly did have some adventuresome lives.No doubt that later incarnations of the boys with Parker Stevenson and Shaun Cassidy in the Seventies and later for Canadian television Paul Popowich and Colin K. Gray in the Nineties were good in their day, but Tommy Kirk and Tim Considine will be the quintessential Hardy Boys for this former devoted Mouskaviewer.The film is based on the very first of the Franklin K. Dixon novels which came out in the Roaring Twenties, The Tower Treasure. The Disney Studio nicely updated the story to fit into the Fifties. The boys get wind of a secret treasure hidden in the dark secluded mansion of miser Applegate. Somebody's taking very seriously the legend that pirate gold is hidden there. And miser Applegate, played by Florenz Ames isn't a guy to ask for help.In the books the Hardy Boys did have a living mother who was not a really memorable character, just your average good mom. Their father is Fenton Hardy, formerly of the NYPD and now a famous private detective. In this serial, he's played by Russ Conway. But the show made Fenton a widower and had Sarah Selby as their constantly interfering Aunt Gertrude. She was in the books as well, but here she was the female of the house. Half the time Kirk and Considine were trying to outfox her to get to their sleuthing business. Selby was memorable I have to say.However what you will remember best is that Treasure Island pirate theme song of the serial about 'gold doubloons and pieces of eight' that is guaranteed to rattle around in your brain for weeks upon hearing it. The Disney channel used to run all these old shows, but around 2000 just surrendered and now run their new shows on the cable network. Hopefully stuff like this will see the light of day again.",1
9,"Finally! After 30 some odd years, I finally got the chance to see The Hardy Boys: The Mystery of the Applegate Treasure in its entirety. In the early 70s, one of the local UHF channels ran repeats of the Mickey Mouse Club from the 50s. Included was the daily serial The Mystery of the Applegate Treasure. For whatever reason, I never got to see the whole thing. So for over 30 years I was left wondering about the show and what happened and how the mystery was resolved. And for 30 years, I've had the theme song stuck in my head. I'm very happy Disney released this series.So was it worth the wait? You betcha! While The Mystery of the Applegate Treasure may not have been as ""spooky"" as I remembered, it was a lot of fun reliving this moment of my childhood. The story is solid in that innocent, child-friendly, 50s sort of way. Remember, this is a serial designed for kids and made more than 50 years ago. The acting is actually quite good. While neither Tommy Kirk nor Tim Considine is what I would call a world-class actor, both give it their all and are a joy to watch. The supporting players are just as good (if not better in some cases) with Arthur Shields, Florenz Ames, and Carole Ann Campbell really shining. The sets are much better than I remembered. Sure, it's all stage-bound, but the Applegate Tower looked as good as I remembered. The direction is capable at a minimum with the usually dependable Charles Haas at the helm. Overall, it's a good show.Disney has released The Hardy Boys: The Mystery of the Applegate Treasure as part of their Walt Disney Treasures line. While I didn't really care about seeing the Mickey Mouse Club stuff or some of the other extras, the overall package is very nice. It makes for a very welcome addition to my DVD library.",1
8,"They simply just don't make family adventure/mystery films like this anymore. I, like many other fans of Walt Disney's superior magic could only wish that a new generation of film makers could bring back Disney's magic but the only one who has come even close on a constant basis is film director/producer/writer Steven Spielberg with films such as Jaws (1975), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), E.T. (1982), Hook (1991), Jurassic Park (1993), and The BFG (2016).The Hardy Boys adventures were good clean fun in the mid 1950's and they are still good clean fun some sixty (60) plus years later. The two stars of this mini TV mystery series are Tim Considine, and Tommy Kirk who play brothers Frank and Joe Hardy. The Hardy boys father is a real detective who the boys try and emulate with their wild imagination about some bury gold doubloons in their neighbors Mr Applegate's backyard somewhere.The boys two friends are neighbor Iola Morton (Carole Ann Campbell) who is sweet on Joe Hardy and a troubled youth named Perry Robinson (Donald MacDonald) who seems to get blamed for a bunch of stolen property until the Hardy boys get involved and start their own little investigation and surreptitiously look for the gold doubloons, and the real thief.Ahhh, to be a pre-teen once again and watch the Hardy Boys adventure for the very first time brings back so many good memories. Now that I own a copy of this hard to find DVD TV mini series my grandchildren will also get to enjoy the pure joy of the Hardy Boys adventures.I give this IMDB title a solid 8 out of 10 IMDB rating.",1
6,"Even though these good-natured Hardy Boys' episodes (which were regularly featured on TV's ""Mickey Mouse Club"") are somewhat silly and strictly juvenile in their story-lines, they are still sure to be of some interest to anyone who might be a nostalgia-buff for 1950's television programs, especially light-hearted ones of mystery and comedy.Set in the small, middle-class town of Bayport, N.Y. - Join 13 year-old Frank Hardy and his gung-ho, 12 year-old bro', Joe, as the suspense and drama unfolds and our 2 amateur detectives (along with their friends and family) search for vital clues that will reveal the truth behind ""The Mystery Of The Applegate Treasure"". (Wow! It sure sounds exciting, eh!) So, sit back, relax, and see just why this highly-popular kiddies' show thrilled television's first generation of children and still continues to thrill audiences to this very day.Filmed in b&w, each of these 19 episodes (dating from 1956-1957) has a running time of approx. 12 minutes. This 2-DVD set also contains some interesting bonus material.",1
9,"Disney's 16-episode serial ""The Hardy Boys"": ""The Mystery of the Applegate Treasure"" (1956) is based on Franklin W. Dixon's (aka Edward Stratemeyer) ""The Tower Treasure""- the first of many ""Hardy Boys"" books. It was the first of two ""Hardy Boy"" serials produced by Disney (originally broadcast during October 1956) for its ""Mickey Mouse Club"" show; which was broadcast from 5PM-6PM each weekday. The one-hour show was broken into four segments with this sort of serial taking up one of these 15-minute segments The ""Spin and Marty"" serials were also used for this purpose. As in the books, Frank (Tim Considine) and Joe (Tommy Kirk) are the teenage sons of Fenton Hardy (Russ Conway), a private detective. Following in their father's footsteps the two boys are looking for a pirate's treasure supposedly hidden in the Applegate Mansion in their neighborhood. The series has a cool theme song (see below). Despite the song there are no pieces of eight. They were one ounce Spanish silver coins, worth 8 reales, or half of a gold dubloon. Frank and Joe are assisted by Joe's girlfriend Iola (Carole Ann Campbell) and hindered by their Aunt Gertrude who is looking after them while their father is out of town. The Applegate mansion is a spooky looking house and when the boys finally meet the owner he confirms that there really is a treasure, given to his grandfather by LaFitte the pirate as repayment for when he burned the Applegate plantation. His grandfather hid the treasure and no one has been able to find it since. The story has gold doubloons and crooks, and Iola gets a lot of scream queen moments. ""Applegate's Treasure"" was my personal favorite of all the MMC serials. The only drawback is that it was a rather complex mystery with a lot of misdirection, and having to watch it in a cliffhanger serial format was extremely frustrating. No sooner had they cleared up the suspense from the last episode than something would happen and they would break off- telling you tune in for the next episode. But we were hooked and faithfully tuned in day after day. A lot of family plans were altered during this time so as to not interfere with daily viewing. Watching it now I was pleasantly surprised by the high quality of the performances by the child actors; especially Campbell and Kirk. The serial is definitely several notches above ""Spin & Marty"" in what was demanded of the cast, and for the most part they come through. The DVD has some nice special features including a 2006 interview with Considine and Kirk in the Disney Studio where the serial was filmed. Also included is the entire (hour-long) MMC episode in which it premiered. It was a Monday, which was ""Fun With Music Day"", and Darlene does a lengthy song and dance number with Bobby. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child. ""Gold dubloons and pieces of eight, handed down to Applegate? From buccaneers who fought for years for gold dubloons and pieces of eight. Handed down in a pirate chest, the gold they sailed for east and west. The treasure bright that made men fight, till none were left to bury the chest. So now the gold and pieces of eight all belong to Applegate. The chest is here but wait...now where are those gold dubloons and pieces of eight?""",1
9,"I remember in the mid 1970's in Northern Ohio they showed reruns of the 1950's 'Mickey Mouse Club' tv show. There was a 1950's nostalgia/revival following 'American Grafiti' (1973) and 'Happy Days' (1974) and Disney shrewdly cashed in by presenting this great show to a whole new audience. I remember this particular series from watching those very reruns of MMC. I didn't see all of the serial at the time but I saw enough episodes to appreciate the Hardy Boys and I actually started reading and collecting the series of fine Hardy Boys books by 'Franklin W Dixon'. Re-watching it today,from start to finish (in one sitting to boot!) may not be for everyone but I enjoyed it quite a bit!
I read that this was made with a very low budget-but they got a lot for their money,and it is not bad in any major way at all.
The two main actors that play the Hardy Boys are Tommy Kirk and Tim Considine. Kirk went on to a long and solid career in other Disney projects,beach movies,and many other lighthearted and fun movies.
Mr Tim Considine had a busy career also as an actor in early seasons of 'My 3 sons' and went on to a long successful tv career. The lucky guy Considine was married to the lovely and beautiful 'Meredith MacRae',who played the blonde sweetie on the 'Petticoat Junction' tv show. Both of the 'Hardy Boys' in this series do a good job with their parts I say. Sure,there are always things to pick at in any show but as this show was shown originally,in
15-minute increments,there is not a lot to complain about. If you watch it like I did,all at once,all the overlap between episodes can be a bit much but I must keep in mind that this was not made or intended to be watched all at once. The overlap was necessary to keep long-time viewers focused and also so that people that tuned in to the series in the middle of it could get some idea of at least what happened in the preceding episode. This is a fine serial and well worth
seeing.",1
8,"cool. i liked it. i first saw this when i was very little and didn't remember any of it. i bought the 'Disney Treasure' edition at the Disney store when it was on sale real cheap. i love Disney but i thought this would be corny and cheesy. it was, but it was sooo entertaining. i lot of this was really funny too. i loved the character of the apartment landlady. she was hilarious. i also liked the scene where the little girl tried to escape with the shovel and stepped on the pipes and began running in one place before she fell. classic.the only drawback here for me was Tommy Kirk. i always love Tommy Kirk in old Walt Disney movies, but here he was so whiny and obnoxious, i wanted to kick him in the butt. i couldn't stand the way he cried and threw tantrums when his dad told him he could't do things. people don't like it when i whine and cry, so why should we put up with it from TK? i thought he acted like a bratty baby face.all in all it was funny and fun. i thought Perry looked like he was related to Aldous Huxley. watcha think? could be.",1
6,"Tommy Kirk and Tim Considine were wonderful as ""The Hardy Boys,"" but Disney has holding on to this like a mean dog with a good bone.  ""Spin and Marty"" re-runs are fun, but woefully repetitive.  Give us some original ""Hardy Boys!"" . .",1
10,"I never heard of these two individuals, till now and so to me they are still kids. I binge watched Annette and the Hardy Boys. Tim is a beautiful boy - incredibly poised as an actor and I am sure he went on to do great things with his career. I would have guessed he would be leading man in many movies. I was totally wowed by Tommy Kirks ability to hit the role on target , ever time , with flare and precision. His mannerisms in the Hardy Boys were just incredible .That kid is 100% boy. Watching him run around over joyed to see his dad- so excited about the mystery case.. and then being let down was the most amazing acting. The other kids I fell in love with in Annette were that little boy steady and that little girl fawning all over him. What a total ham bone! I would have guessed these 2 got married in real life. I love the entire case of both series and Annette was just darling. The talent, singing and comedy are stunning. They dont make kids like that today. Well, got to go now. Tim and Tommy, just found something in someone's shoe - lets see what they will do next, they seem very excited about this.",1
10,"We bought this ""disney treasure"" and took it to our lake house to watch with our children over summer vacation.We will always remember the summer we watched the Mystery of the Applegate Treasure. We looked forward, each evening, to the next episode. So much fun. It is the end of the summer and they are still singing the theme song. I know it will be a sweet memory for years come. I wish there were more shows like this to experience together as a family. We ALL enjoyed it!With so much ""junk"" out there, it was so refreshing to watch something that both our children and ourselves could really enjoy.",1
9,"This episode is one of a handful that has no introductory mission. Instead, Briggs is shooting pool when a gangster, Egan, approaches and announced his gang has kidnapped a friend of Briggs' daughter--and they'll kill her unless Briggs' team springs an important witness against Egan from police custody. While Briggs knows the witness will be killed and cannot allow that, he also knows that the team needs to at least go through the motions of kidnapping the guy in order to give them a chance to get the girl.""The Ransom"" is one of the better episodes--mostly because it didn't stick to the tried and true formula. It also had a really neat ending--one that was awfully exciting and clever. Well worth seeing.",1
7,"""The Ransom"" is the first episode wherein the IMF deals with the mob after it has become its trademark in the last few seasons of the show in the early 70's.Mobster hood Frank Egan kidnaps the daughter of Briggs' friend,who is set to testify against the mobster before a grand jury.The objective is clear:to liberate the witness from witness protection in exchange for the daughter.Things become more complicated as the witness have no idea what happened to the daughter.The IMF goes on an mission to save the witness from the heavily guarded hotel.No question that the episode was slow and not as exciting as the previous episodes considering that the IMF isn't really into a complicated mission.The interesting part of the episode is how quick the IMF is going to complete their mission.Nevertheless,Steven Hill provides us an outstanding performance.",1
10,"In its day, the series was brazen, innovative, fun. But the criticism then (and now) was that the team was (like Drake in Danger Man) forever solving problems in countries whose names you couldn't pronounce in parts of the world you would never voluntarily visit. (A tradition the Tom Cruise films followed to a certain extent). This episode is special. First, we have Stephen Hill before ""contract issues"" forced him from the show. Second, the spark for the story is entirely personal. Briggs assembles the team to do a favour for a friend, and that twist (WHICH THEY ONLY DID ONCE) forms a ""connection"" to the audience that, to be frank, the rest of the series lacked. Recommended.",1
9,"As others have pointed out, this one doesn't start with a tape, but with a gangster who kidnaps the daughter of one of Briggs' friends as a hostage to be exchanged for a stool pigeon being held under police guard so he can't testify before a grand jury. Like many of the Briggs episodes, this one includes a lot of improvisation, because matters don't proceed exactly according to plan. It also features a doctor who is obviously a ""regular"" IMF partner, although he appears only in a couple of episodes. It's tight, suspenseful, and keeps you guessing.One negative. The actor playing the girl's father isn't as believable as I'd have liked. He seems to go between trying to call the police despite Briggs' warning that doing so will guarantee his daughter's death and trusting Dan and his crew without the emotional depth to make the transition believable. Still, the deviation from the standard formula is refreshing. MI did a few episodes like this during its run. I'd have liked a few more. But I don't want to take anything away from this little story. It's a winner.",1
8,"This is a very interesting episode for me. I always thought that no outsider knew what the team actual did. When the agents were picked from their portfolios, it appeared that they had cover jobs. Cinnamon was a famous model, Rollin seemed to be a famous actor / impersonator, etc. So I was confused when it seems that in this episode, Egan knows what Briggs does, in fact when Briggs tricked Egan into thinking that Augie was in the phone booth, he makes it very clear that if Egan does anything the the girl, Briggs will finish him, Briggs goes so far as to say, ""no matter where you are I find you and I'll kill you, and you I can do it.""
I enjoyed this episode very much, I just find it a curious that Egan knows all about Briggs and his team.",1
9,"Wow.. where do I start? This is one of those bad quality, early 70's movies that played at 10:00 AM Staruday Mornings. Usually, it was part of the particular TV Station ""sales pitch"" for the local replacement window & siding company... You know, they sponsor the movie and set up the commercial breaks to look like telethons; phones ringing... lots of activity... OH,, yeah, Back to Our Movie...... Without divulging anymore than the title of the movie does, I can tell you this: ABSOLUTELY, SPECTACULAR, TOTALLY OVER THE TOP PERFORMANCE BY WILLIAM SHATNER. Completely out of control with his searching looks, pauses (extended) during dialogue, made every effort to steal every single scene in the move. (I wouldn't have respected him if he hadn't) But wait... there's MORE. He's wearing those Gow-Awful Choclote Brown double knit suits complete with matching vest, plaid collared shirt with no button down collars... but worst of all... It was the dreaded and feared 1970's Necktie. Thick.. very odd pattern on it... about 9 full inches in width at the widest point and to top it off, His necktie (which should have had a registration number on it) was adorned with the most perfectly executed ""Double Windsor"" knot I have ever seen. I wouldn't go out of my way to see it, but if you can find a reasonable to ""scam"" a copy from somebody. I promise it will be worth your while.",1
10,"If you like the out of control, over-acting William Shatner... this movie is for you. Bad brown suits, mutton chops, gigantic 70's neckties with double windsor knots... HUGE sedans... Great movie on a Saturday afternoon just after Soul Train. In fact, on of the other main characters in the move is the guy who played Tawney Kitaen's father in the movie ""Bachelor Party"". I also love the old style telephones and bad TV's. All furniture is very 70's dark with odd shaped lamps, etc. All fabric is genuine naugahyde or pleather... Nice corduroy jackets with patches on the elbows. Who invented plaid jackets and why? Did anyone really think they looked decent in them? White belts? White shoes? Zip up boots? Keep killing me.",1
8,"Blair trying hard to take away Dan's spotlight was pretty fun. Especially her speech when she shoved him away after he said one sentence and went on herself for a while. Oh man, Lily really went to fight in this episode. I actually like what she did with her sister. That Lola better doesn't try to win against her. But what she said to Rufus was pretty ugly. And Chuck's parents story gets more and more complicated. That poor guy!",1
8,"The story line gives you all the plot you need to know. Basically this is John Wayne's Stagecoach on a train. Same group of motley travelers thrown together and while being help prisoners by bandits, we get a glimpse into their character. The twist here is the bandits are a group of young kids lead by a very young—20 years old at the time—Dennis Hopper who demonstrates he has acting chops. Here Hopper he plays a psychotic Abe Larson who wants fame and plans to get it by kidnapping the President of the United States. And he demonstrates his badness by gunning down two unarmed men just to make a point. Worth a watch just to see Hopper. There are no real surprises as we know Cheyenne will save the day and prove that the much maligned Indian passenger, Eddie Little Sky, is the one who is the real hero.",1

6,"The plot is that two skate boarding friends sell their blood for cash to live on the streets of Mexico. They also develop a taste for each other which adds a sexual element to the goings on.Then the big deal comes along – but there is a catch it is with some gangsta boys but what they are offering is both too good to turn down and too good to be true.To say any more runs the old plot spoiler risk. Now this has been panned in some sections for being a bit of a mess in that some ends are left very untied and that the plot jumps around a bit. Now for me that added to the authenticity and a better feeling of 'Cinema verite' about the whole thing. Some of the actors were sourced from Facebook but I did not see that as a problem but moreover added to the variety of the players as in the real World.The main lead roles were more than competent and the filming was both realistic and almost casual as if the scenes being played out were or are an everyday occurrence. There is not much in the bedroom department but some nudity at the start. The real point here is the story itself and just because it was not neatly packaged replete with epilogue does not, in my opinion, detract from what is a very note worthy film.",1
8,"Blood trafficking, skateboarding and romance combine in the shadows of Mexico City. Miguel and Johnny hang out in an abandoned truck trailer tank, thread through foot and vehicle traffic on skateboards, get high on various substances and only abandon this easy-going and carefree existence when they need cash. Donating blood keeps them in the black. When offered 100 pesos ($6) for each blood donor they can find, Miguel and Johnny ask few questions and get caught in an undercurrent of greed and malevolence.This poignant and timely film is a conglomeration of various genres including, surprisingly, cerebral and stoner. The actors, some found on Facebook, are adept at their roles and made me feel like I was watching a documentary of their lives. The film is slow-paced and the action and violence subtle. There is constant movement as if all the scenes were captured in one take. Music, ambient sound and casual conversations flow into each other almost naturally. It is intriguing to see Mexico City at night, glide beneath its highway underpasses and see its graffiti coated concrete alleyways up close. ""At the heart of this film,"" said the director who was at this 2016 Miami International Film Festival screening, ""is a love story."" There is little to lament beyond a small budget.",1
1,"This is like a third rate rip-off of some Harmony Korine pile of excrement from the 1990s. There is no plot, no character development, no direction, cinematography, or music. Skateboarding. Selling blood for profit. Some meaningless sex (the fact that it's between two boy matters not), and even more meaningless gratuitous (and not remotely attractive) nudity. At a time when the American government is trying to turn its people against Mexico, this is definitely NOT a good movie to be seen north of the border. For that matter, I can't imagine why any Mexicans would want to see it.Read all the 1, 2, and 3 star reviews here. They are all entirely accurate.",-1
1,"I Promise You Anarchy against Frameline if you see this film. Frances Wallace, Executive Director of Frameline saw this at the Toronto Film Festival & she recommends this incoherent film? Did we see the same film? With a great soundtrack & raw sexual scenes were promising but the rest of the film is a hot mess. Nothing really makes much sense & scenes of a truckload of ""cash cows"" to milk left the viewers & the protagonists clueless as to what happened to them. Also a murder is left unresolved. For a film about the blood trade it's pretty much bloodless. The final scene is like one of those, ""What Happened?"" It was a complete waste of time.",-1
9,"This is a rich, atmospheric, masterfully photographed, piece.I wouldn't have thought you'd need to live in Mexico to understand this movie, but based on the majority of the ridiculous reviews I'm reading here it looks like you may. What the hell's happened to IMDb? Did all the decent reviewers go to letterboxd? Seriously people if you're going to rate a movie 1 star because you didn't get it... just move on.I loved everything about it. Photography, screenplay, acting, direction. I think the music was perfect all throughout. Perhaps the only legitimate criticism I've read here is that the sound is not very good and it's sometimes hard to hear what the characters are saying.The ending is heartbreaking and bizarre. The plot is quite simple and enticing.::::::Spoiler alert::::::It's not that complicated. If you need everything spelled out for you, then you won't like this movie. It doesn't need to explain to you exactly what happens to every single character. Do you read the news? It's up to your imagination to figure out what a bunch of narcos will do with 50 people they bought for 6k dlls. The main characters don't know and that is exactly the point and the richness of the horrifying feeling of uncertainty you share with them.Beautiful film. Watch it.",1

She has two girl-on-girl encounters and then pleasures Ric Lutze her real life boyfriend. Cyndee Summers also takes on Lutze and a muscle bound stud in some hot hetero action. The plot revolves around Lutze as a panty manufacturer who employs Summers and an unidentified large breasted girl as models for his line of panties. When two prospective buyers and Bond arrive the action gets going with all three couple getting it on causing a jealous Rene to get into a cat fight with Summers and the fur starts flying. Something Weirid Video has a DVD version called Bloomer Girls, also not to be missed.",1
6,"Never heard of that movie before, but judging from the cover it seemed quite interesting, even though it just cost me 2,99  (the same price I paid for ""Prom Night III"", which is considered the worst movie ever to be watched in our dormitory...)A story about a Russian 11th century village, almost torn apart by the struggle between traditional ""heathen"" cultists and the newly introduced church. After a kind of midsummernight-orgy the dismembered corpse of a village girl is found, nude and raped. The villages' chief claims the deed to be done by a werewolf, the priest declares it a result of heathen practices. Half the village joins a wolf-hunt while the pater organizes a witch-hunt. Only the healer of the village, more an artisan than just a ""wise woman"" senses the truth which much closer to reality than myth or religion and she therefore ends up as the scapegoat both parties are willing to sacrifice...A nice picture I really enjoyed watching, despite the slow action and the more than obvious plot (completely summarized on the DVD-cover), lacking any unexpected turnouts. Both, my sister and my roommate were pretty bored. I really love how the narration neither takes sides with church nor heathens. The allurement of that movie also lies in its pictures that seem more ""natural"" than those of any Hollywood-movie. It's starring ""real"" people, displays a real landscape and uses real dirt instead of paper-mâché-sets and plastic-actors with plastic boobs. Oh, btw, there's a high degree of nudity in that movie... quite aesthetic. All in all a good buy...",1
2,"I want to warn the people who by any means happened to face this movie.I really regret that I watched it and I will have to get rid of many not-very-pleasant-at-all pictures which got stuck in my mind. I don't understand this urge to show corpses in such details. Maybe that happens because authors didn't have any other tool to influence the level of watcher's adrenalin, but to me it brought only incredible disgusting feeling and I went out from cinema with the clear desire to clean my mind from this watching. And that's not only because of the corpses. I hate speculations on the theme of religion and culture, but when a Russian director does it and in such a shallow way – it's just unbearable. I honestly was trying to find any idea in the story, but unfortunately – didn't manage. Yes, I want to take the responsibility to say that there is no idea there, no philosophy, only the realistic pictures of unrestrained sins and killing. My vote is not ""1"" (awful) just because of the beautiful girls running all over the screen. Kinda good advertising for Russian brides.But I can't recommend this movie to anyone anyway. It poisons the mind. It is consciousness-murderous.",-1
9,"While there were a lot of gangster films made by Warner Brothers in the 30s and very early 40s, this stands out as perhaps one of the very best. Part of this is due to the pairing of Cagney AND Bogart, as there is so much energy and excellent ""thuggish"" acting that it's hard to get bored watching it. About the only negative at all is that as Humphrey Bogart was not yet a breakout star, it's rather predictable what will happen in a showdown with Cagney. But despite this, watch the movie. It's got all the ingredients of a fine gangster flick--excellent acting, writing, a breezy pace and the Warner Brother's trademark of both quality and action designed for the common man.",1
9,"1939 was such a classic, milestone year for film cinema. So many great films, 'The Wizard of Oz' and 'Gone With the Wind' even being masterpieces. 'The Roaring Twenties' had a lot of talent involved, James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart both had career full of great and more performances and Raoul Walsh (in a different film for him at this stage of his career) sure could direct. Also like the genre 'The Roaring Twenties' fits under.'The Roaring Twenties' did not disappoint. While it is quite rightly highly regarded today, considered by quite a number of people a genre classic and great representations of both Cagney and Bogart, it is a shame that it was over-shadowed by a lot of other films that year and doesn't get as much attention. 'The Roaring Twenties' may not quite be a film milestone in the way that the best films from such a great year are, but it is a great film in my view and deserves the high praise it gets.It is not quite perfect, with it being a bit of a slow starter and a film that didn't grab my attention straightaway.Luckily, 'The Roaring Twenties' got going very quickly. And when it did get going, boy did it blister. The photography is atmospheric and very stylish, the noir-ish lighting also adding to the impact. Was amazed at how evocative the Prohibition setting was. The music is appropriately moody without getting bombastic or syrupy and Walsh's direction is remarkably skillful in how vividly the deceptively gleaming yet very ominous at times setting is portrayed. As well in generating suspense.Something that 'The Roaring Twenties' does incredibly well in. The script has a sharp wit and tight tautness, with some quite hard to forget quotes. Cagney's last line, one of his greatest, really stands out, the very last line of the whole film likewise. Also really loved the hard boiled edge exchanges of dialogue between Eddie and George, delivering on the entertainment value too. The story is both entertaining and suspenseful, especially in the exciting final third. Cagney's exit is one of his greatest.Characters are well written, personally found George and especially Eddie (very meaty) very well defined. The acting is just right, Cagney is just terrific in a role that is so perfect for him and one that he played extremely well and better than most in that type of role. Bogart has great laconic intensity and steel, giving one of his best pre-'Casablanca' performances.Altogether, great. 9/10",1
8,"The Roaring Twenties was the third and last film that James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart worked on together. As usual Cagney was the good bad guy and Bogey the bad bad guy. They went out in style with this one. Shortly afterwards Bogey finally got his own A star status with The Maltese Falcon.Cagney, Bogart, and Jeffrey Lynn are three doughboys from World War I who meet just before the Armistice is signed. The plot then focuses on Cagney and his inability to adjust to civilian life. But then Prohibition comes, voted right into the U.S. Constitution, and Cagney sees his opportunities and takes them.In fact all three of them get into the rackets of selling illegal alcoholic spirits and they meet up again later. There stories, individual and combined, are set against the background of the historical events of the 1920s in a nice documentary style with narration by John Deering. There are two prominent female players in the cast also. Priscilla Lane beloved by both Cagney and Lynn and Gladys George who is supposed to be that famous nightclub hostess Texas Guinan with a different name who carries a big old torch for Cagney. Both do a fine job, especially Gladys George the quintessential good time gal with a heart of gold.Writer and critic Mark Hellinger wrote the script and Hellinger in his day was quite the boozer. He knew the bootleg and nightclub scene in New York inside out. Gladys George's character is Texas Guinan, the others are composites of people he knew and dealt with.Raoul Walsh one of the best action directors ever keeps things going at a crisp pace. In a James Cagney movie there ain't no other kind of pace.At the beginning there's some narration saying that in the future people might not believe this era could ever happen. The film was made in 1939 and Prohibition was repealed by another Constitutional Amendment. Now 85 years after it took affect in 1920 The Roaring Twenties has an almost unbelievable quality to it. I'm not sure young people watching it today take it for reality.But believe me, we were that stupid in America. The prime movers behind Prohibition were the Protestant fundamentalists who got the U.S. Constitution changed to fit their particular views. And the Roaring Twenties is an expose of the stupidity that followed. The film is great and should serve as a warning against future meddling with the our Constitution.",1
6,"First off, as I was watching this I kept being reminded of BOARDWALK EMPIRE, what with the characters involved in action in the First World War and then returning home to set up a bootlegging outfit during the Prohibition; I'm sure Nucky Thompson even gets a mention at one point. After the set-up, this turns into the James Cagney show once more, with the PUBLIC ENEMY actor putting in a compelling performance as a master criminal whose live revolves around him attempting to juggle romance, business, and his rivals.THE ROARING TWENTIES benefits from an assured supporting role from a youthful Humphrey Bogart and some wonderfully staged scenes, particularly at the impressive climax which must have been akin to watching the climax of De Palma's SCARFACE for audiences of the day. Cagney's performance carefully brings all the quirks and flaws out of his character, and without him this wouldn't have been half as good.",1
8,"Lloyd Hart (Jeffrey Lynn), Eddie Bartlett (James Cagney) and George Hally (Humphrey Bogart) are war buddies after falling into the same bomb crater. After the end of WWI, Lloyd goes back to practicing law. It's the start of prohibition. Eddie is out of luck without a job and Danny Green offers him his cab. He goes to see his pen pal Jean Sherman (Priscilla Lane) but she turns out to be a school girl. He gets thrown in jail after being tricked into delivering a bottle. Panama Smith (Gladys George) pays the fine to get him out of jail. Eddie soon joins Panama in the business. He becomes successful with a fleet of cabs. He keeps Lloyd as his reluctant lawyer. Then he runs into an older Jean. When he fights another bootlegger, he runs into George who's running liquor for the another guy. George convinces Eddie to join forces.The only problem for this movie is that Bogie doesn't come back until after an hour. So a warning to his fans, this is more a Cagney film. I would have preferred they stay together through the whole movie. That would make any double cross more compelling and any fights more heart breaking. There is singing, and there is gangster violence. It's a nice gangster movie with a couple of big gangster stars.",1
7,"The Roaring Twenties is a hard boiled gangster film and it has singing as well. It can almost pass for a musical.Three men meet in the trenches during the last days of World War I. Eddie Bartlett (James Cagney) meets George Hally (Humphrey Bogart) while facings bombs and bullet. They are joined by Lloyd Hart (Jeffrey Lynn.)After the war, Eddie finds that he has no job to return to and has to drive a cab to make ends meet. When Prohibition comes into force Eddie falls into bootlegging and makes a success of it. Lloyd becomes Eddie's lawyer and both fall for the same girl Jean Sherman (Priscilla Lane) a showgirl whose career Eddie promotes.George and Eddie team up in the bootlegging business but it is an uneasy relationship as George can be cynical, cruel and callous. After the Wall Street crash, it is Eddie whose fortunes reverse. However Eddie has a showdown with George when Lloyd's life is in danger.There is a lot of subtext in this film, no wonder one of the writers got into trouble during McCarthyism. The Roaring Twenties is critical of the treatment of the returning soldiers from the war. It is angry with Prohibition, it made ordinary people into criminals, turned people to drink and led to the rise of the gangsters who made money from bootlegging and paid off the police to turn a blind eye. Then there was the aftermath of the Wall Street Cash.The film is a melodrama, a lookback at the past when the American government made stupid rash laws to protect the nation's morals. Yet there is violence as Eddie builds up his criminal empire who then divests it to try to go legitimate. There is a splinter of the story used in the 1983 Scarface remake as Eddie realises that the woman of his dreams does not want him.",1
9,"This movie covers American history between 1918 and 1939. It starts with James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart as soldiers fighting in World War I, and ends up with their involvement in post-prohibition rackets just before the outbreak of World War II. It is apparent from the get-go that Cagney is a basically nice guy who just gets a bad break. Even through prohibition, he drinks only milk, while Bogart is violent from the start. Unlike his character in ""The Fighting 69th"" (another World War I drama from Warners), Cagney wants to do his duty as an American, while Bogart enjoys killing from the get-go. He even wants to take his rifle back to America with him. Back in New York, Cagney wants to settle down as a cab driver and avoid the rackets which have come out with the threat of prohibition, but times are tough and even in pre-depression America, unemployment is rampant. Along with pal Frank McHugh, he goes to visit the girl whose letters kept him comforted during the war, and finds out that she is a teenager. Later, she turns up (as played by Priscilla Lane) in the chorus of a musical, and Cagney finds himself falling in love with her. With no hope of getting steady work, Cagney gets into the rackets, and as he becomes more powerful, uses his influence to get Lane a job at the speakeasy run by good-hearted moll Gladys George. It's shades of ""Love Me or Leave Me"", but Lane is never as interesting as Doris Day's Ruth Etting in that later excellent musical.The narration of John Deering takes us through World War I, the struggles of returning vets after the end of the war, and even how the Volstead Act came to come into being. We also see the stockmarket crash, the election of FDR, and the end of prohibition which takes rackateering into new levels. Bogart has faded out after the World War I scenes, but comes back as Cagney's prohibition rackateer gets more powerful; They ultimately join forces, but it is apparent that Bogart is bound to betray Cagney as soon as it suits him. While this narrative seems to cover a lot of territory in just 90 minutes, it does so seamlessly without being sappy or sentimental. Lane sings a couple of great songs, and later on, George does too, with that whiskey voiced cynicism that makes her unforgettable. In a year of great performances, George gives one of the best, and was certainly worth of Oscar consideration. It's obvious that she's playing a Texas Guinan type character. If you ever listen to the CD of the flop Broadway musical ""Legs Diamond"", listen carefully to the performance of Julie Wilson's speakeasy hostess. It is much modeled on both Texas Guinan and Gladys George here.There are some gruesome deaths in the film, including one that is particularly grizzly because of the poor victim's facial expression. The Lane/Jeffrey Lynn pairing isn't interesting, but is necessary because of how it moves Cagney's character forward and reveals hidden sensitivities inside him. When Lane is singing ""I'm Just Wild About Harry"", watch Gladys George's facial expressions while she watches Cagney, who is tapping his hand on George's. It's a silent performance that reveals so much and is heartbreaking. The ending is now a classic, which gives George one of the greatest closing lines in movie history.",1
10,"In 1919, in the end of the World War I, the G.I. Eddie Bartlett (James Cagney) meets George Hally (Humphrey Bogart) and the student of Law School Lloyd Hart (Jeffrey Lynn) in a trench and sooner the war ends. Back in USA, Eddie is not able to find a job and is sustained by his great friend Danny Green (Frank McHugh), who offers Eddie to share his cab and make some money working as cab driver. Eddie decides to visit Jean Sherman (Priscilla Lane), who had corresponded with him during the war and is crazy about him, and for his surprise, she is a teenager. In 1920, with the 18th Amendment, the Volstead Act is in force, beginning the period of the unpopular Prohibition. Eddie accidentally meets the owner of a speakeasy Panama Smith (Gladys George), they become close friends and she introduces him in bootlegging of liquor. Eddie becomes rich, meets Jean Sherman again and falls for her. He also raises a profitable partnership with George and Lloyd is hired as his lawyer. In 1924, bootlegging has a grown from individual effort to a big business associated with corruption, violence and murder, and the light machine-gun Tommy becomes an important tool in this business. Lloyd and Jean fall in love for each other, and Eddie has a great deception. Later, on 19 October 1929 with the Black Tuesday, Eddie looses all his fortune, and when the Prohibition falls after thirteen years in force, he returns to the activity of cab driver. On the Christmas Eve, when he meets Jean again as a client of his cab, his life is leaded to a tragic end.""The Roaring Twenties"" is certainly the best gangster movies I have seen together with ""Once Upon a Time in America"". I have just included this stunning movie in my list of favorite films ever. It is impressive the capacity of the screenplay writers and director Raoul Walsh in developing a complex and magnificent dramatic story of crime and romance, supported by historic events and wonderful songs, in 104 minutes running time only. The cast, with James Cagney, the lovely Priscilla Lane, Gladys George and Humphrey Bogart among others, seems to be in state of grace with perfect interpretations, particularly Priscilla Lane, singing magnificent classic songs with a wonderful voice. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Heróis Esquecidos"" (""Forgotten Heroes"")",1
8,"James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart made three films together, each with Cagney receiving top billing. This was the middle film, following 1938's ""Angels With Dirty Faces"", and just before the same year 1939's ""Oklahoma Kid"". The movie opens with shellfire over a World War I foxhole, the boys joined by Jeffrey Lynn's character Lloyd Hart. It's April 1918, and post war plans and the news of the coming Prohibition are topics of conversation amid enemy fire.The film does a nice job of tracing the background of Prohibition, making much of the changes that occurred in the country and how difficult it was for returning servicemen to find jobs. Those who turned to bootlegging became part of a vast ""criminal army"", although in some quarters, the bootlegger was looked upon as a modern crusader and hero. By 1924, booze is big business, and by that time, wartime buddies Eddie Bartlett (Cagney) and George Hally (Bogart) have hooked up - Eddie makes and peddles it, George can get more in a big way. After they hijack a warehouse load, they're in deep and tempers begin to fray, as George resents taking a back seat to Eddie's control.Adding to the tension is an unrequited crush Eddie has on Jean Sherman (Priscilla Lane), first introduced as Eddie's wartime correspondent who views him as her ""hero"". But as the story progresses, Jean falls in love with Lloyd Hart, the final member of the opening scene foxhole trio who has become Eddie's business lawyer.""The Roaring Twenties"" doesn't have the intensity of some of Cagney's other gangster films, like ""White Heat"" or ""Public Enemy"", but that shouldn't be considered less of a recommendation. The principals are all in top form, including Gladys George as Panama Smith, and the always entertaining Frank McHugh as Bartlett's hometown pal and partner Danny Green. The movie ends on a fitting note; Eddie's fortunes parallel the 1929 stock market crash - he falls off a cliff and keeps falling, until his final confrontation with George ends tragically for both. Panama utters the movie's final line putting Eddie's career into perspective - ""He used to be a big shot"".",1
10,"I've heard for many years about the fact that Warner Bros. released many gangster flicks during the '30s, and how the animation department incorporated the dialect into their cartoons (just listen to Bugs Bunny's accent). But few of these movies are quite so riveting as Raoul Walsh's ""The Roaring Twenties"".It starts in WWI-era France, where American soldiers Eddie (James Cagney), George (Humphrey Bogart) and Lloyd (Jeffrey Lynn) meet on the battlefield. Returning to New York after the war ends, they try to restart their old lifestyles, but the country has changed: not only has a different person taken Eddie's job in the garage, but a new policy called Prohibition has banned the sale of alcohol. Naturally, this only helps to strengthen the criminals, who sell alcohol in speakeasies. So, with Eddie and George forced into a life of crime, we see that we're in for an intense film. Things take yet another turn when the stock market crashes, plunging the country into the Great Depression.I would say that probably the most interesting character is Jean (Priscilla Lane): the most wholesome young woman of all, she takes a job singing in speakeasies, surrounded by rather seedy people, while in a semi-relationship with Eddie; it's a near 180 from her upbringing.I certainly recommend this movie as one of the best gangster flicks of the era. It really transports you back to the '30s (and even earlier). Check it out. Also starring Gladys George.",1
8,"Two of the most famous actors of their day - James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart - are featured here, along with two very interesting women (Priscilla Lane and Gladys George). That foursome would be fun to join anywhere.Lane is the wholesome pretty girl and George is the tough female bar owner. The latter may not look as good but she delivers the best film noir lines in the movie near the end. In addition, Jefferey Lynn is good as the clean-cut, nice-guy attorney and Frank McHugh draws laughs as Cagney's buddy (as in real life). Paul Kelly is convincing as a hood.With this cast, you know you are going to get a well-acted movie. It moves at a good pace, too, with few lulls. The gangster language of the period was fun to hear.The first time I saw this film I was disappointed. Maybe I expected too much. On the second viewing, I throughly enjoyed it. Having a great DVD transfer on the second viewing didn't hurt, either. It's a nice sharp picture.",1
7,"This was directed by Raoul Walsh and included many of the Warner Brothers stalwarts. You'll recognize many familiar faces if you're an aficionado of the genre. Rip-roaring, no-nonsense stuff, it's basically organized around three stories: (1) Cagney's rise from unemployed ex-soldier to the top of the bootlegger heap and back again; (2) the love quadrangle involving Cagney, Gladys George as the soft-hearted blowzy Panama Smith, Priscilla Lane as the ""good girl"", and Jeffrey Lynn as the lawyer; and (3) the friendship of Cagney, Humphrey Bogart, and Jeffrey Lynn in the trenches, turning into a wary partnership, the eventual defection of Lynn, the ruination of Cagney, and the death by natural causes (three bullets) of treacherous, greedy, petty Bogart. According to Mark Hellinger's story, the end of prohibition by Franklin Delano Roosevelt put an end to the gangsters. Zealous moralists, take note. The answer CAN be found in the bottom of a glass.As far as the movie is concerned, there's nothing much not to like. You may have seen it before, sections of it, in one guise or another. Citizen Kane boosted his girl friend's opera career, didn't he? And as a matter of fact Cagney himself boosted Ruth Etting (Doris Day) in ""Love Me or Leave Me."" And this was far from the first shootout Cagney had with treacherous ex-colleagues -- or the last, for that matter. But they're all stitched neatly together here. It should be seen if for no other reason than that it's an almost perfect exemplar of Warner's 1930s gangster movies. And it has a famous last line too -- ""He used to be a big shot,"" says Panama Smith over Cagney's corpse. Granted, it's not, ""Good-night, sweet prince, flights of angels sing thee to thy rest."" It's a classic line only because Walsh's direction and Gladys George's reading make it so.I rather enjoyed it. There is Priscilla Lane's plain vanilla ice-cream beauty, Bogart's horrifying overacting when he's shot, Gladys George's softly knowing brittleness, Jeffrey Lynn's unimaginative, bourgeois impulses, and above all, James Cagney's acting. He's pretty good. And good at whatever emotional state he's projecting, from doomed resignation to cocky superiority. And he's outstanding after he falls from grace and winds up a seedy bum, haunting saloons and living in hovels that offer rooms for 15 cents a night. He realizes that his time has run out just as he's leaving Flannagan's Saloon, drunk, and for some reason he pauses at the piano on his way out, stares down at a half-empty glass of beer, and smiles to himself, both with sadness and relief. The shot is held for a while too. And it's not strictly functional -- a small but masterly gloss on Cagney's character development.Well worth seeing.",1
8,"I only bought this because it was part of a four DVD boxed set with three Cagney gangster films I wanted in my collection... I'm glad it was included though as it is a great film. Unlike the better known ""The Public Enemy"" and ""White Heat"" Cagney doesn't play somebody who is bad from start to finish, instead he is drawn into crime almost accidentally, although once there he enjoys the wealth it brings.The film opens during the First World War with three US soldiers in a crater. After the war they each return home; Lloyd becomes a lawyer, George returns to his saloon and Eddie Bartlett returns to the garage he used to work in only to find that his job has been taken and there is no other work there for him. Somewhat disheartened he goes out of city to meet Jean Sherman, the beautiful woman who had been writing to him while he was fighting in France, only when he gets there he finds that she is a school girl, she wants to keep in touch but he things she is too young.Back in New York Eddie gets a job driving a cab but that goes wrong when a customer asks him to drop off a package at a local club which leads to him getting arrested for breaking the prohibition laws. He protected the woman he was making the delivery so she paid his fine and offered him a job in a more lucrative trade. At first he is just delivering booze but soon realises he can make more money if he makes his own to sell. When going out to collect a late payment he sees Jean again now she is a few years older she is beautiful and Eddie quickly falls for her and arranges for her to work at the club he supplies. Trying to expend his business he approaches a big time racketeer but is refused, not taking no for an answer he hijacks a shipment of booze and is surprised to find his old war buddy George captaining the ship. Soon George is double-crossing his old boss and working for Eddie. Business may be on the up but Jean isn't interested in Eddie, she has fallen for the third of the friends; lawyer Lloyd.The stock market crash and the end of prohibition leaves Eddie without money and all he has left is one taxi cab. After a chance meeting with Jean he finds himself having to confront his old friend George in order to protect Lloyd.The cast is all good, especially James Cagney as Eddie and Humphrey Bogart as the less than pleasant George. The leading ladies, Priscilla Lane as Jean and Gladys George as club owner Panama Smith were also top quality. While there was less action than some other gangster films the story was still interesting, it was also nice to see a leading character who wasn't really a bad person.",1
6,"Prohibition crime-drama full of nervy street-smarts and overheated bravado. James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart (making somewhat uneasy screen-partners, particularly in their early scenes) play World War I buddies who meet up again years after returning home; Cagney has become a big-time distributor of bootleg gin, while Bogart, the strong-arm for a racketeer, has the idea that if he and his old pal team up, they'll be unstoppable (there's really no reason for Jimmy to say yes, except for old times' sake). Cagney's character gets the interesting story arc over trigger-happy Bogie, and his loyalty to nice-girl songbird Priscilla Lane and friendship with affable cohort Frank McHugh is rather charming. Some of the rapid-fire dialogue is juicy and a pleasure to listen to but, unfortunately, the characters fall too soon into cliché, and the cynical comedic edge developed in the first-half disappears altogether (most likely due to the myriad of script-writers who worked on the project). Director Raoul Walsh's montages showing the passage of time--and the loss of morals in America--comes off like finger-wagging, shaming the audience for its reckless behavior, which is the last thing you'd expect in a snarling meller from Warners. **1/2 from ****",1
8,"James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart are gangsters in ""The Roaring Twenties,"" a 1939 film also starring Priscilla Lane, Gladys George, Frank McHugh and Jeffrey Lynn. Cagney, Bogart and Lynn are Eddie, George and Lloyd, who all end up in a foxhole right before World War I armistice is declared. Eddie plans on going back to work as an auto mechanic and Lloyd plans to work as an attorney. Once in the real world, Eddie finds there are no jobs for returning vets. He soon goes where the money is, in bootlegging, and hires Lloyd as his attorney. Eventually, robbing another mobster's shipload of high-priced liquor, Eddie runs into George on the ship, and the two join forces. Eventually they become enemies.One night, Eddie spots a young woman, Jean (Lane) in a show - as a teen during the war, she wrote to him; when he met her and saw how young she was, he left her house in a huff. Now several years have passed, and Eddie falls for her. He manages to get her a job in a speakeasy run by his girlfriend, Panama Smith - the implication is that Eddie is sleeping with her but there are no strings. Lloyd and Jean fall in love. Everybody knows it but Eddie.The above are the two plots that move ""The Roaring Twenties,"" which provides some interesting Prohibition history along with the story. Bogart is not yet the big star he would become a year or so later; he plays a mean criminal with no regard for anything or anyone very well. Cagney's great performance garners more sympathy as Eddie, who seems almost a victim of circumstances as well as being unlucky in love. Gladys George's Panama is really in love with Eddie, and her hurt is obvious to the audience. Frank McHugh does a terrific job as Danny, who originally brings Eddie into the cab-driving business. Lynn is fairly bland a Lloyd, which is intentional - he would be just the kind of man the young, traditional Jean would fall for. Lane is an ideal ingénue.Raoul Walsh does a fine job of directing this film, which contains lots of action scenes. Truly an excellent cast in an absorbing Warner Brothers film which more or less closed their era of big gangster movies.",1
10,"I must say, this is one of the best films of gangsters in the 30's I've ever seen.  Sometimes stupid script doesn't hide the terrific performances by James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart.  Both play WWI guys who after the war, there lives become different.  Cagney becomes a big-shot gangster after becoming a lame taxi driver, only to find himself back again where he started.  And Bogart plays a villain in a great form (and before Casablanca no less) who is now against Cagney.  Sometimes memorable, but mainly used by performances and a ending that would have inspired Martin Scorsese (and probably did).  A-",1
10,"Superb 1939 film with Gladys George, terrific in a role that was meant for her. A tough broad whose time has past, but with an endearing heart.With Cagney and Bogart at the helm, what could possibly go wrong. Caught up with the after World War 1 inability to find work, both fall into bootlegging during prohibition and become quite good at it. Cagney, in a change of pace, plays a much more sympathetic person, whereas Bogart is as bad as they come and finally resorts to murder to get what he wants.What makes the film so good is that ruined after prohibition was repealed, Cagney realizes that his time has passed him.Priscilla Lane plays the young girl he loved. Though her voice was not the best as she belted out old favorites, she conveyed the innocent young girl caught up in a difficult time, falling for the mob lawyer, a rather benign Jeffrey Lynn here.Gladys George would definitely steal the film with her wisecracking, tough by lovable character.",1
7,"After ""The Great War"" ends, G.I. James Cagney (as Eddie Bartlett) returns home from France. He expects to return to his old job as an automobile mechanic; however, the boss breaks a promise, and turns Mr. Cagney away. In fact, the United States is descending into economic turmoil, which will end with ""The Great Depression"". Unable to make an honest living, Cagney drifts into profitable ""Prohibition""-era bootlegging. Valiant speakeasy hostess Gladys George (as Panama Smith) pines for Cagney, but he only has eyes for sweet Priscilla Lane (as Jean Sherman). As the years roll along, Cagney's trusted lawyer Jeffrey Lynn (as Lloyd Hart) falls in love with pretty Ms. Lane Warner Brothers seems to have pulled out all the stops for ""The Roaring Twenties"". Cagney, who had reached an extraordinary peak with the recently released gem ""Angels with Dirty Faces"", is a marvel to watch, from beginning to end. Interestingly, after this film, Cagney sought to stop to his ""gangster"" image, until ""White Heat"" (another gem, from 1949). But, here, Cagney is still the victim of circumstances; note, he does not become a criminal due to his nature. In this film, Cagney is another ""Angel"", with a environmentally influenced ""dirty face""... ""The Roaring Twenties"" is, also, about relationships; or, to be more specific, it's about unexciting relationships. The only believable passion Cagney's character has is for best pal Frank McHugh (as Danny Green), who needed some more expository scenes. The one that got away, Ms. George makes the most of a poorly scripted relationship between her character and ""Eddie"" - this is the pairing the film really serves up short shrift.The production is ""top of the line,"", but the story is neither as strong, nor as artfully told as its studio's other ""gangster"" movies. Still, a star like Cagney, supporting players like Humphrey Bogart, and bit players down to Maurice Costello, make ""The Roaring Twenties"" purr.******* The Roaring Twenties (10/23/39) Raoul Walsh ~ James Cagney, Gladys George, Humphrey Bogart",1
5,"Raoul Walsh directs this often slow paced gangster flick. Three army buddies find their lives and relationship changing dramatically following the second World War. James Cagney is a cabbie that is corrupted by Prohibition and becomes a typical ""big shot"". Humphrey Bogart is the owner of a saloon/speakeasy and becomes a major bootlegger. Jeffrey Lynn returns to civilian life and becomes a lawyer and eventually falls in love and marries Cagney's love interest Priscilla Lane. The great ending is the most memorable thing about this movie. A very strong cast also features: Gladys George, Frank McHugh and Joe Sawyer. Another M-G-M gem.",-1
7,"Imagine this for a film plot: Soldier fights in Afghanistan , returns to America only to find there's no job for him and the girl he met on an internet chat room is entirely different from how he imagined and to make ends meet starts dealing drugs and find himself climbing up the underworld ladder . You see that fictional plot is very very similar to the plot of THE ROARING TWENTIES and shows how formulaic cinema plots are . It also shows that there's an appetite of movie goers who enjoy this type of tale despite the large and small changes in society over the decades THE ROARING TWENTIES starts with a caption by Mark Hellinger lamenting the 1920s as being the decade which was marked by prohibition on alcohol . From the outset the film takes a totally unrepentant stand that prohibition was a complete disaster being both unenforceable and allowing a market to be controlled by gangsters . Hellinger hopes that America will never see such dark days again but if he were to see the damage brought on to American society in the 21st century by illegal drugs you get the sneaking suspicion that the only way to solve the problem would be by legalising the problem . Drugs including alcohol are certainly a menace to individuals but the menace to society is a bigger one if they're outlawed This isn't a bad gangster film but seems forgotten alongside many of its contemporaries . One thing missing is that it lacks an emotional core like ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES which made a more compelling movie . It also seems to run out of the steam in the second where plot turns rely on unconvincing coincidences in order to drive the story forward which is a shame since the first half is so good",1
8,"A battlefield in WWI is the setting for the opening of this story. Three men find shelter in a trench. As it happens, the trio will get involved later on during peace time in ways that will alter their lives. The lives of Eddie Bartlett, George Hally, and Lloyd Hart will keep crossing one another as peace is declared and they go back home to New York....Eddie Bartlett comes home to find out he is unemployed. The position he had as a mechanic is no longer there for him. Remembering his pen pal Jean Sherman, who sent him all sorts of goodies while he was at the front, he decides to meet to thank her for her kindness. His pal, Danny Green, who did not go to war, is happy to take him to Mineola to see this war pal. What he did not realize Jean is a teenager still at school living with her mother in that suburban setting.As Prohibition was enacted, enterprising men like Eddie Bartlett saw a silver lining in the fact they could make a lot of money in making their own booze, distributed in different venues of the city. Eddie became friendly with Panama Smith, a sometime singer who owned a speakeasy. Eddie figured it was the perfect setting in which to sell his merchandise. George Hally came on board to the illegal operation. Lloyd, who was a lawyer, joins the group as Eddie asked him to help Panama beat a charge. As he becomes successful, Eddie discovers Jean again working as a chorus girl in a musical revue. He wants to give her a chance as a singer at Panama's joint. Eventually, George breaks his association with Eddie to go on his own. The two men will become rivals. Eddie, loving Jean, sees her fall in love with Lloyd who could offer her a decent home away from that environment. Panama, who secretly loved Eddie, is the only one that stayed with him when the empire he had built comes crashing down.One of the best films of 1939, this Warner Bros. picture was directed by Raoul Walsh. Based on a story by Mark Hellinger, the screenplay was written by Jerry Wald, Richard Macaulay and Robert Rossen. Prohibition, as shown in the film brought out the worst in people. An ill conceived law that brought the criminal element to control the illegal liquor, was devastating for the country that was followed by the Great Depression. The film was photographed by one of the best cameramen of the era, Ernest Haller.An inspired James Cagney is a magnetic presence in the film. His Eddie is one of the best roles he played during his distinguished career in the movies. Humphrey Bogart is seen as George Hally in an understated performance. Gladys George made an excellent contribution to the film with her Panama Smith, the tough girl in the illegal booze circuit. Priscilla Lane is seen as Jean, a decent girl out of her league as she became a singer. The great Frank McHugh appeared as Danny Green and Jeffrey Lynn as Lloyd.",1
6,"Three World War I buddies return from the war, when two of them become bootleggers (JAMES CAGNEY, HUMPHREY BOGART). The third one, JEFFREY LYNN, is a clean-cut war buddy who becomes a lawyer.PRISCILLA LANE does a passable job as a singer in a clip joint and gets to handle some nice oldies with a certain flair--but let's face it, she has those ""American as apple pie looks"" and appears out of her element in seedy surroundings. GLADYS GEORGE, as a wise-cracking joint owner of the place, is right at home in a tailor-made role.Cagney and Bogart resort to crime during the course of their bootlegging activities, with Bogart getting especially rough with an old Army sergeant (JOE SAWYER) and showing no mercy when it comes to pulling off a crime caper with his handy gun.Bogart gets uneasy with his pal, Cagney, and is soon planning a way to double-cross him. Priscilla Lane has fallen in love at first sight with lawyer Jeffrey Lynn. And Raoul Walsh keeps the tale spinning toward a violent climax, keeping all of the action fast-paced and giving the film a lot of colorful '20s atmosphere that gives it flavor and style.JEFFREY LYNN gives the only wooden performance and PRISCILLA LANE is a bit too bland to play a nightclub singer despite the golden oldies she sings in low-key style. But JAMES CAGNEY elevates the film with a really gutsy performance, especially good in his final scenes with GLADYS GEORGE, when both of them are down on the skids. Their chemistry is evident from the start.For Cagney fans, this is a must see Raoul Walsh film.",1
7,"After making this gangster flic in 1939 Jimmy Cagney stayed away from the genre throughout the war and immediate post-war years before returning ten years later as Cody Jarret in White Heat. This means that if one were to erase the Strawberry Blondes, Bride Came C.O.D. etc from his cv he'd have two excellent gangster movies back to back. Although he gets top billing he has a great back-up trio in the shape of Bogie and the two diametrically opposed women in his life, Gladys George and Priscilla Lane. Lane, one of the Four Daughters who captivated John Garfield the previous year comes off worse but to be fair she has little to do except sing pleasantly, look wholesome and more or less turn in a prototype Doris Day (who would, of course, achieve stardom at Warners) whilst Gladys George, who would play opposite Bogie again in The Maltese Falcon, turns in a beautifully understated performance as the not-really-that-bad girl who clearly worships Cagney's Eddie Bartlett from afar. Warners were still clinging on to their semi-documentary stories-ripped-from-the-headlines schtick that had proved so profitable so we are treated to a portentous voice-over pitched in suitably dramatic tones that traces key events of the first half of the twentieth century from world war one through prohibition the Stock Market crash etc, a slightly cruder technique than the more polished version perfected by Noel Coward in plays like Cavalcade and This Happy Breed. Not a masterpiece but neither is it chopped liver.",1
8,"Three men (James Cagney, Humphrey Bogart, Jeffrey Lynn) who fought alongside each other in World War I try to make a go of it in 1920s America. Cagney tries to go straight but is pushed into a life of crime as a bootlegger. Bogart doesn't even try! He's rotten and he loves it. Lynn becomes a lawyer but soon finds himself pulled into the business by pal Cagney, while also falling for the girl Cagney's in love with (Priscilla Lane).James Cagney gives one of his finest performances of the '30s. Bogart is a deliciously evil villain. Every scene he's in, he's great. Lane and Lynn are fine but I found myself disliking their characters by the end. But that's probably more to do with my sympathies lying with Cagney. Gladys George is terrific as Panama Smith, a nightclub hostess who holds a torch for Cagney. A first-rate gangster picture like only Warner Bros. could do. Great direction by Raoul Walsh. If you're a fan of any of the stars involved or just a fans of WB gangster pictures in general, you just have to see this one.",1
10,"The cinematography in this movie is beyond amazing. The closeups made me feel like I was there. From just watching the movie, I had olfactory senses of garlic and oregano. To this simple minded viewer, this movie has raised the bar for both gay erotica and gay denial erotica. The portrayal of victim-hood displayed by the Randy character was overwhelming. I laughed, I cried, I yelled, I relieved myself into a dirty sock. When the sequel to this movie is made, and there's no doubt that it will be, it simply will not have been soon enough. I'm left wanting more and more. I expect to see this movie thrusting in and out and in and out of my life until my dying days. Move over 'The Dogfather' a new champion of film has arrived!",1
9,"Probably because the same thing happened to me during my dating days I can very much identify with the the man in this story. I saw it twice, second time with my wife, who also liked it. Being an idealist, the film's happy ending was satisfying. It seems like a Christian film, but the only mention of God is at the very end where the guy swears before God that he will stick with her for a lifetime. Some Christian viewers would probably think that God should have been brought into the story more directly. However, consider that the Bible's Book of Esther nowhere contains any reference to God, but yet the providence of God is clearly seen in numerous instances. Same with this story. Providence is there. I don't often like films as much as this one.",1
8,"The Cradle will Rock is the 6th episode of the 8th (and final) season of Diagnosis Murder. It has some moral dilemmas and intrigue that really makes for provoking post-episode discussion.One of the hospital nurses, Stacy Bradshaw (played by the beautiful Lisa Thornhill) embarks on a cougar type affair with Ray Santucci (Chad Michael Murray) who works as a hospital orderly (cue Bloodhound Gang's The Bad Touch). The episode doesn't specifically indicate if they Did It, but it's suggestive. Stacy convinces Ray that she's the victim of physical abuse from her wealthy husband Derek, but we later learn she got the bruises from boxing lessons at the hospital. There was no physical abuse. Anyway, Stacy goads Ray to murder Derek while he's on a hunting trip in the Angeles Forest, and Ray ends up being charged with murder. Mark Sloan thinks there's more to it, and thinks Ray was in cahoots with Stacy in the murder. Mark seeks information from Carla Padilla (Nicole Tarantini), who is heartbroken that Ray has fallen for Stacy. She delivers a touching line to Ray before his arrest, saying that relationships based on physical feelings won't last long. Then Ray tells Carla that whilst he loves Carla, he's not in love with her.The Police (in cahoots with the doctors and possibly Ray's father) cause Ray to get ill, and this sets of a chain of events involving a wrist chain which Ray thinks is the one he gave to Stacy.",1
2,"...and this episode is one of the reasons DM didn't make it to S9...it continues a lurid theme that had been increasingly prevalent on the show in the past few seasons, which clearly was a direction that both sponsors and the fan base (myself included) did not appreciate. Too bad, but we'll always have the truly well-written episodes (the vast majority of them, thankfully) to remind us why we fell in love with this show in the first place.",-1
8,"When the mean old UFO-flying purple alien jerk Tatanga invades the exotic kingdom of Sarasaland and abducts the fare Princess Daisy to be his bride, it's up to a certain super plumber to save the day in this early Game Boy staple! I remember this very well, I had lots of fun with it back in the day, it was dead easy to pick up and get into and it was a lot of nice simple and addictive fun, and it's still a very enjoyable mini-adventure to skip through today. It was different from what people may have thought a Mario game to be, yet familiar at the same time. You're still running and leaping around squashing enemies and bumping blocks with your head, but this time it wasn't set in the Mushroom Kingdom, there is no Luigi, no Bowser, Mario isn't actually trying to rescue Peach, instead of fireballs you shoot silly bouncy balls, a truly bizarre and awesome touch is that it plays the can-can theme when you get a star, and Koopas explode after you jump on them rather than sliding across the ground. Mario meets enemies never seen before or since, like a level full of killer Easter Island heads and a mini boss that's a killer cloud that shoots birds at you, it gets pretty weird, and the biggest variation is the vehicle levels that were thrown in for good measure that see Mario controlling a submarine and a plane! It's a very straightforward little adventure that is over in no time, and the look of everything was all very squashed down so it could fit the newly-launched hand-held system's capacities, but that by no means prevented it from being fun to play. The sprites are adorable and it has a lot of quaint 8-bit charm and the music is a delight and had some fun and personality put into it. This game was one of the reasons why the original Game Boy quickly became so popular, and while not as beloved or in the same league as say..Super Mario Bros 3, it still has a special place in the hearts of many gamers who played and loved it as kids and it still holds up as a sweet lil' gem of its gaming era. #When he gets a star it plays a little of the can-can, Mario's the man-man, he always gets the girl, da-da-da-da-da-da!!! # Good game good times!

6,"""Super Mario Land"", the original entry in the ""Mario Land"" saga (which paved way for the more popular, and arguably much more fun ""Wario Land"" series) was one of Mario's first major adventures on Nintendo's hand-held ""Gameboy"" system. The game is very true to the nature of earlier titles, and at times, it almost feels like a slightly modified port of the original ""Super Mario Bros."" for the NES. You play as Mario (of course) who must save Princess Daisy (a different princess than ""Peach"" Toadstool, Daisy was later sort-of ret-conned into being Luigi's love interest after she was used in the live-action film) from various dastardly enemies.The presentation is halfway decent. Characters are a bit too blocky, especially considering that only a few short years later, ""Super Mario Land 2"" presented a vastly improved style almost on par with ""Super Mario World"" for the Super Nintendo. Backgrounds are nice and fairly detailed though, and enemies are halfway decent looking. The music is nice and catchy, but there are no familiar Mario tunes! It was really irritating that none of the iconic themes were used, and in fact, some of the music is actually a digital cover of classical ""Can-can"" kind of music.There isn't much story (Mario must save the princess, that's the whole story), but Mario has never been about the story, so I can forgive this.I suppose there are two main reasons for the lower score, though, and they are very irritating during gameplay. The first reason is that the controls feel quite loose, and it's hard to get the platforming down good- I constantly find myself overshooting or undershooting jumps, or missing my targets by mere millimeters. It is especially frustrating when there are enemies around, as you will often try to jump on top of them (which kills them), only to accidentally jump in front of them and get killed by them instantly. It also doesn't help that the hit- detection is very glitch-y. You will often get killed by an enemy before they even touch you, or will die if you don't hit them perfectly, 100% dead-on- the other games in the series are nowhere near this nit- picky about it, here you will die a lot of times for almost no reason. More than once, I've landed on top of an enemy perfectly, and it kills me. I've also accidentally run into an enemy head-on, which should have killed me, yet it killed the enemy. Awful hit detection.The other problem with the game is the bizarre difficulty. Level-to- level, the difficulty will ramp up or completely go away. It's a very uneven game. Also, the game does a lot of unfair things, like re- spawning you right in front of a pit when you die (which I guarantee will cause a lot of gamers to scream- they immediately come back to life only to fall down a pit because they weren't expecting it to be right there), or throwing a TON of fast-moving enemies at you when you don't have anywhere to go to avoid them. Be prepared for a lot of frustration!This is a very average Mario game. Which, to be honest, means it's a very weak Mario game. (As they are generally near-perfect platform games) I gotta give this a disappointing but playable 6 out of 10. Don't expect much from this one.",1
10,"Super Mario Land is a good Gameboy counterpart to the classic NES games. It embodies all the elements used in the original. What I most love about this game is the fact it was original. Instead of taking place in the Mushroom Kingdom, Mario journeys to the Kingdoms of Sarasaland to save Princess Daisy and instead of fighting King Bowser Koopa, Mario fights Tatanga. Also, in a couple levels Mario gets to use a vehicle. Either a plane or a submarine. Very fun. Super Mario Land was fun to play while the sequels were kind of stupid and pointless.",1
8,"I gotta say. For a Mario game that came out in the late 80s on a handheld of all things, this game is awesome. With great gameplay, level design, music, and creative boss battles, this really does feel like a full fledged Mario game for the most part, and is very impressive for it's time. But if there's one thing that wasn't that kind to this game, it's time. This game, while still definitely a Game Boy classic, has aged pretty poorly. The visuals, while they were definitely passable for the time, are very primitive. Mario is made of like 4-6 pixels at most, and the same can be said for just about everything and everyone else in this game. They're still easy to distinguish, but this definitely won't invite those who've never played a Mario game before. If there's one thing good to come out of that, at least the game isn't hard to look at on the Game Boy screen, so at least there's that. The game itself is also extremely short. Again, this was passable for it's time, but finishing this game after playing each successor may be disappointing for those hoping for a long and grand adventure. The reason for this is that this game only has 12 levels. While that's still definitely impressive for an early Game Boy game, it's tough to really get into a game that's so short. Other than that, this is still a very competent Mario game that I do recommend to Mario fans, as this does have most of the great things that Mario fans, like myself, look for in a Mario game. It may not be 6 Golden Coins or Wario Land, but this is still a great Mario on the go.",1
2,"This game SUCKS. The controls are bad, the physics do not work, the Fire Flower is replaced with the Superball Flower, it sucks. If you find this game for free, don't play it. The only redeeming quality is the music, but otherwise, it's bad and you should never play it.",-1
7,"Three bank robbers wearing masks and who look like they know what they are doing hold up a bank. But those things you never count on always occur. A civilian who was a diamond dealer had a licensed weapon and he shoots one. Another helps the wounded guy out of the bank and the third is left in the bank with two hostages.Donnie Wahlberg and Jennifer Esposito catch the case. It turns out the one left in the bank is near and dear to the Reagan family especially the older ones Tom Selleck and Len Cariou.I won't say any more, but there are plot elements in this one that are from one of my favorite noir films Kansas City Confidential. Watch and see what I mean.",1
6,"This episode is a good example of how Wahlberg playing Danny keeps hurting a very good and enjoyable series. He is a screen stealer and used his influence to cause Jennifer Esposito to leave the series because he had to constant cut her off. We all really enjoyed her. In this episode, his Hollywood power was used to have his character override a hostage negotiator which was so stupid. He really hurts a good series. Who wants to watch an extremely arrogant person on the screen. His control must be gigantic.",1
7,"Once again, Bagdasarian has managed to pack a lot of movie-making know-how into a short film format. 'Consumed' makes no attempts to hide its intent or to mask its message. The short lampoons a not-so-far away Orwellian future where corporate consumerism literally invades a man's life.The story itself isn't what grabs you here, it's the feel. This film as all bout bringing out odd emotions and mixing them together.To start, the musical scoring has that synth-future keyboard tone normally reserved for Dr. Who or creepy 1980's sci-fi. It's cheesy, it's creepy, and somehow, it plays perfectly into this tale.Markham does an excellent job portraying an 'everyman' kind of lead. Although the part has no lines, the actor's body language and facial expressions are enough to convey the story. I kept waiting for him to speak, which kept my interest.The script pokes fun at every form of modern consumerism and does it well. After watching this short, I knew I wasn't depressed, but somehow felt I should start taking drugs ""just in case"".In the span of this short film's 12 minutes, I managed to laugh, get creeped out, get grossed out, and then laugh some more. Nice roller-coaster.So, if you're looking for a well written, well made short film that has a quirky appeal, check out 'Consumed' -skatanic_23",1
10,"The first three seasons of this series are very interesting. Though they are centered on three main characters, some are added in the most opportunistic ways and some are eliminated in the most tragic and dramatic ways. That's fascinating. But then some are destroyed and yet they can come back with some miracle, or some twisting of some rule or even rules. There is no gospel – and certainly no Bible – of monsters in this series. And yet The vampires are seen as nothing but killers and no matter how hard they try to be human and integrate society they have to kill to survive by feeding and no one can survive without feeding. So they have to kill humans or use humans as bleeding cows, which is not that easy to achieve. The second solution was tried by Stephen King but it did not lead too far. The series does not try the solution brought up by Anne Rice, feeding on corrupted and perverted criminals and human beings. The series does not try at all to introduce any dimension of morality in the vampires. They can play at being human but they cannot be in any way human.The werewolves get a better lot because they are not eternal and they have kept some of their human qualities which are experimented here like getting pregnant because they are animals but living animals and hence can have a reproductive procedure of their own. What happens when a female werewolf is impregnated by a male werewolf on a full moon night? Gritty and stupendous voyeurism, isn't it? But this animal dimension enables these werewolves to retain some humanity, including the moral dimension of love. They can really love and that love may redeems them. But once again Anne Rice's very recent solution is not worked on at all: once again attacking only evil human beings and changing at will and when necessary.The series brings that love between George and Nina to the procreative level, which is very physical indeed. But it also brings that love this time between George Sands and John Mitchell to a real peak of intensity and power. Two men – even if they are not men – can love each other so strongly and deeply that they cannot kill each other because of their love and yet so strongly and deeply that they can kill each other for the very same reason, because of their love. This twist in the series is not gay because it is in no way sexual, but it is fully gay in a way because that love is real love and gay love is love between two men or males and it does not have to be sexual. We are living in a world that is finally understanding that love is the most intense passion of humanity and that it has little to do with sexual realization, though it can lead to that sexual realization if such is the sexual orientation of the concerned subjects, an orientation that is sexual as indicated by its very name and thus has little to do with the mental and spiritual relation between the two concerned males, with the mental and spiritual orientation or passion two males or men can experience.The third type of beings is ghosts and particularly Annie. But she is a fool and appears like that all the time, making tea but not drinking it, loving a vampire and wanting to reform him by having him punished by human justice, meddling all the time with the life of the people she loves or who are her friends and with human society in general. She is always misguided and manipulated by events and other ghosts and she is unable to protect those she loves, to reform those she loves and even to really love those she loves since she has them destroyed in the end, or rejected. Don't try to be a ghost in this life, you will end up in the gutter of human society.Then the story is hyper messy and at times difficult to follow because it is opportunistic and we do not always see a simple and single line in the plot and in the various characters, though there should be since it is a mini-series and not an American series like ""Supernatural"". Too many of them are resuscitated, regenerated, recuperated and too many are wasted, destroyed and lost forever with absolutely no logic in it. But the series is superb as for its main male characters, John Mitchell, George Sands and Tom McNair, not to speak of Herrick whatever his name may be. But I must admit the female characters are rather weak. Finally some peripeteias are simply un-needed, like the turning of a dead child into a vampire by John Mitchell for the sake of the child's mother though the child will never come back into the picture in the three seasons. What a waste of vampire material! In one word these monsters are trying to be human but around them the human characters are extremely weak if not systematically under-graded if not de-graded. The human society is purely circumstantial and thus evanescent and uninteresting. But what an interesting cheese fest with the male monsters! Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",1
9,There will always be that great debate If this is better or worse then the original BBC version of the show. There will always be British purist out there who say British versions of any tv show is better then the American counterpart. I watched both versions and I liked both versions but the British one had too high a turnover rate. I really liked that this continued the story of the three friends until the end. One of my favorite storylines was the love story between Josh and Nora that went on for the majority of the show. It was the heart and soul of the show and I thought the British version dumping their counterpart did the show too much harm. So in my opinion this version was better for that and that alone. That this version seems to no longer stream on anything but Amazon for cash. I miss watching it.,1
1,"What can you expect from the creator of supernatural and a remake of Frequency... The show has some sort of amateur feeling to it, and although the actors are not the worst there, they are not far from it. The plot is clichéd, boring and certainly made for people who think that supernatural is a good show, so quite poor in general. The whole ""vampires are cool in a twilight way"" is annoying, as well as the attempt of something they want you to think is humour.I didn't watch the original UK series, but I will give it a try and see if it's any better. After all, north American remakes are not known for their brilliance.",-1
7,"I just watched the American Being Human and I have a confession. I liked it. I prefer the BBC version but I liked the American Being Human. If you're not familiar with it the plot of Being Human is about supernatural creatures that secretly live among us and a werewolf, vampire and ghost share a place together while trying to pass as human. That's the plot of both the BBC version and the American version in a nut shell. When it first started the voice over gave me this uneasy pseudo-intellectual impression of talking down to the viewer with simplistic while terms trying to sound deep, a major turn off for me. But it gradually got better. The main plot is very obviously taken from the early 2008 Being Human pilot from BBC 3, the major differences start with the character names and the supernatural powers.The vampire is named Aiden instead of Mitchell. And unlike Mitchell Aiden can't eat human food. Aiden also seems physically stronger than Mitchell. Aiden's also over 200 where as Mitchell was only 100, having been made a vampire during World War 1. He also has the power to enthrall people like the vampires of Forever Knight, a power the vampires of the original Being Human did not have. Aiden's maker is the local vampire lord or king, Bishop, who in the original BBC version was named Herrick but otherwise serves the same exact purpose. Aiden also lacks Michell's personality quirk of wearing hand warmers / finger-less gloves everywhere. Aiden is more intellectual than Mitchell. He quotes Byron and is a fully qualified nurse. Mitchell a janitor in the original BBC version. Both work in a hospital with the werewolf. I don't like that make up when he's feeding looks obnoxiously like Edward Cullen's make up in Twilight. Don't mix Twilight with my Being Human... I also didn't care for how the fangs looked. The fangs look pretty bad. I guess I'll get used to them but I think the BBC version had better fangs and had really cool looking black vampire eyes which I haven't seen on this one.Sally is a LOT like Annie from BBC Being Human. They even have the same outfit. Where Annie was murdered by her fiancé, Owen, who tried to flush evidence down the toilet (causing the house's plumbing problems) it seems Sally was killed by her fiancé Danny (Yes, plumbing problems). However Annie had a quirk of liking to make hot drinks and leaving them around the house. Sally (so far) can't interact with the world around her. The supernatural creatures can see her but she can accidentally fade out of view for them too (a nice effect the BBC version does not have). And even our Supernatural boys Josh (the werewolf) and Aiden (the vampire) can't physically touch her (yet) unlke Annie who had no trouble interacting with other supernatural creatures. One thing I did NOT like was she made a twilight comment about the werewolf and vampire. The original show has never done this. Please don't mix Twilight into my Being Human... Josh is the biggest change. He's the werewolf and in the BBC version his name is George. Before and after his werewolf transformations they do not show his behind at all but this is to be expected, somehow in the last ten or so years the human behind has become taboo on American TV. We USED to be able to see it. I don't know why we can't now. There's a little joke about Josh and Aiden possibly being lovers when they first move in but it's very glossed over. The scene is a lot funnier in the BBC version because George is a very spastic and neurotic character who babbles when he's nervous and has very geeky, intellectual nerd traits. Josh is not a spastic nerd which takes away some of the charm. In fact he comes off as somewhat of a jerk. I am not too thrilled with the personality of the werewolf. His potential love interest, a character named Kara (Nina in the original BBC version) seems to have more of the original neurotic, babbily, awkward geek personality that George originally had in the BBC version. This is a cute character trait. Nina was a little shrew-like in the original series. I feel the Josh and Kara personalities are a reversal on George and Nina. A funny joke borrowed from the original series where George and Mitchell (now Josh and Aiden) are mistaken as a couple has lost it's edge because Josh doesn't have the spastic awkward response George had. Blink and you'll miss it. The werewolf transformations were better than the usual CGI syfy effects BUT the BBC transformation scenes are still superior for visual quality and detail. Another change made was in the original pilot it was George's exfiance that showed up at the hospital and would later unfortunately follow him to where he makes his monthly transformation. In this version it's Josh's younger sister who follows him. One thing I wish they had changed from the BBC version but they didn't is in both versions they have the werewolf only change one night a month. Technically the full moon is three to four nights a month. Also George changed at Moonrise. The moon was already up in this and Josh hadn't changed yet. He clearly doesn't change until the sun has gone down. The American version felt a little rushed, plot-wise. The time progression is uncomfortable and jerky whereas it seemed smoother in the BBC version. The British version is set in Bristol while the American version is set in Boston. The background music was also pretty good. In general I still prefer the original BBC version but this was a lot better than I thought it would be. I thought I'd hate it. Instead I actually want to watch it and see where it goes... assuming it doesn't get canceled.",1
8,"I have to say that Being Human took time to grow on me and at times I felt I was being led down a path that would leave me sorry I had wasted my time watching the show. I read this sentiment in many reviews articulated in various ways, but the bottom line is Being Human is a very good show, however it isn't until its over that you truly appreciate the show for what it was and is because the end is not sloppy, hacked, or rushed. It simply brings a lot more meaning to the previous seasons and makes you appreciate the whole show a great deal more. At that final place is when you truly engage all that the show brought you through and makes you appreciate the idea behind the story and realize it is much more than you thought while on the ride.Season 4 of Being Human was the best season of the series without question. The peculiar thing is that I believe it was the best season because it was the last season and the really big questions that this show presents in terms of our main characters can't be answered until the show ends. The other seasons gets us to know the characters, vested in them and the story, and took the viewer to the point of a unique interest in a world of monsters trying to retain what they could of their humanity while by their nature made it impossible to obtain anything but frustration and heartache. But season 4 didn't just bring the story to a close, it took us back through the story with a perspective of how things could have been much different but for the groups will to make them different and appreciate the first 3 seasons a great deal more in the process of taking the characters to a place that I couldn't have imagined in the beginning.Interestingly after seeing it all I realize they could have made the series longer, but to make it maintain its overall quality the only way they could have done that would have been by making what is season 4 the last set of episodes (or 75% of them) the final season however they wove the story in any other seasons. But given the nature of shows like this that teeter on the edge of being renewed each year there isn't the security to allow the writers to do that. So given the unknown faced with writing each season I have to say that season 4 made my opinion of the writing go up a great deal as it was the best by far and brought a somewhat uneven story come together in a way such that I enjoyed the final episodes far more than I ever would have thought. There are some oddities that bothered me throughout the series that the end made the trip very worth the effort, and a wonderful ending that left me surprised in a day and age when shows rarely surprise me in a positive way. Season 4 makes the whole series better and I'm certain had they figured out a way to work that sort of intensity and emotion into the other seasons would lave made Being Human a more popular, longer running show. But as it is, I'm simply glad I got a chance to enjoy it.",1
10,"Very unique show, seeing how a wolf, vamp, and ghost get along as roommates. Havent watched the UK version yet, but I hear it's pretty much the same thing, plus I believe this released after the UK one. My favorite character was for sure Sally, she had me laughing from the gut so much. The show also had some sad moments, and ones that made you cry happy tears, like how Josh and nora named their kids after aiden and Sally to remember them by <3.",1
3,"It's been so many years, I don't really remember enough about the original series. But I do seem to remember it may have also left me with mixed feelings. The parts where they create an alternate world where vampires and ghosts and such exist is interesting and fun in a way. But in this case, sadly, they use it as an outlet to make some of the show just scummy and wildly unhealthy, rather than imaginative and interesting. Between the snuff film style, vampire gore porn scenes they like to film, (not to mention the actual plot devise of exactly that within the show) and Sally rapist ghost (far the only example of them asking the audience to justify and sympathize with the most scumsucking and unhealthy choices possible), this show isn't going to be pure entertainment, nor is it ever going to leave anyone better off for having watched it. Its just a mess.",-1
1,"Warning spoilers!I have watched a good amount of this show and have stopped because it's gotten TOO sad. I mean no matter what genre you have you MUST have some joy to it. Drama, Horror, Romance, Fantasy, etc. If it's all just sad sad sad what is the point? If I wanted to stare at sad people I would just watch the news!Additionally when all you have is depressing $#!t it gets boring. Like watching paint dry. Why do that? These people have horrible problem after horrible problem with NO resolution of said problems. It just gets worse. You know, you have to have light in order for dark to exist. Get it?Also the rules of the show make no sense. This just seems like another lazy American copy of a British show. ENOUGH! Avoid this show.",-1
6,"So, first I binged watched both recently.
Heres what I do and dont lile about the US version.
Aiden's cant stand the actor he is dull as dirt drying and ugly. Mitchell will always better as the vamp..
Loved Josh as apposed to George annoying as heck .
Sally is great as well no complaint about her at all .
Dident like whatever her name was at the beginning she looked like someone the picked off the street sorry but could have done some.better casting a whole niche of nobody's really woth very little talent.
However, in some ways the story line was many times better. Cant say way or it's a spoiler.. I liked that they was nurses and not just maids haha..
Someone said that Aiden's had been around longer than mitchel true yet only a tad since it was 2011 and not 2008 when the show started and ended . Over all though they was both created during the revolutionary War. One was fighting for Brithish the other American. Honestly, if they just would have filed.both shows st the same time could have tied them together so well.",1
5,"The pilot started off well with bring the characters together under one roof. Horror and humor seem to go hand-in-hand which Sam being the one that will make up the fall guy and and keep the show fresh.Each of the characters has their own unique demon and all are trying to struggle through life to achieve some level of balance to be accepted by society. The goal of being part of life as opposed to an observer with a evil secret will carry the story for sometime and remain fresh (think Angel).However, there is always a rub and here is what keeps this show from being an '8' as opposed to just above average.Having each of the characters be unique without really knowing if there are any of their kind would truly make this a great show. Instead, we have the cliché of the brooding vampire trying to become good while being tempted by his sire to do evil.Similarly, Sam's character ""Josh"" seems to be a recently turned werewolf of 2 years or so. He is isolated and alone (and looks great in the nude scenes, who knew he had such a great body) and pleasures himself while watching Nova. While he is the comic relief of which he excels, previews of upcoming shows finds he is not alone and he will find other werewolves. Too bad, another missed opportunity to keep him isolated and dependent on his roomies for comfort.Finally, we have a ghost who comes off a little too strong at first and is locked in the confines of their house. There are Bettlejuice moments to be sure but what they will with her character is yet to be seen. Strangely, vampires have met ghosts in the past but she didn't seem interested in knowing the particulars. Seemed she would have had tons of questions but another opportunity missed.The show has great potential even if it has started in a direction that is a disappointment to me. For now, I'll keep it on the TiVo Season Pass and hope they tighten up the script and dump some of the brooding vampire ""should I run with my bad sire or hang with my homies"" script that is pulling the show down.",-1
10,"I give it 10 stars because it is perfection in the art of storytelling. I am an American viewer, and I prefer the American cast. Let me first say that if you are like me, you haven't watched Twilight saga or True Blood and generally you feel sick of vampires at the mere mention. That said, what made me tune in to Being Human? I saw the ad on a city bus and it struck my curiosity. I looked into it and loved the premise - modern roommates, cursed in 3 different ways, all trying to be normal. I watched the pilot and fell in love. This series has been at the top of my list since. I can't wait for it to start again, and it kills me when a season ends - always a great cliffhanger!I adore the werewolf, Josh. I sympathize with Aiden, the vampire. And Sally, well, Sally is just irresistible fun! Nora is also a great character and actress ... sincerely, I give this series 10 stars because for me (and I am quite picky about storytelling practices) - this series is FLAWLESS. Perfectly written, which above all is a must. Perfectly cast. Perfect performances each week. Fabulous direction, editing. And the makeup artists and CGI artists are cream of the crop!Being Human makes me look forward to Mondays!",1
7,"I liked season 1 of this show but I wonder if they are going to try to take the show in a more disturbing direction because of the success of the very disturbing American Horror story? It would certainly spell the end of me watching if they do. I'm also not a fan of any of the music they've been playing in this show, which is the main reason I am close to abandoning it. Also, truthfully, the cheesy ""imagine great-ter"" slogan as spoken by the male Syfy voice has me jaded against any of this network's original programming. The trying to fit in aspect of this show is pretty cool and I would recommend it over any other active horror programming on TV though that's not really saying a lot.",1
10,I seriously can not recommend this enoughThis is a U.S. show based on a U.K. show. Typically the Brittish version is good/great and the US one fails. This is the only one I've ever heard of where the US one turned out to be much better!I like vampire moves & shows but don't usually care for one's based on warewolves or ghosts. This one is the best vampire series I've ever seen and I even found the wolves and ghosts to be highly compelling. Very original and surperb writing & acting.,1
9,"Fun show, yes another Brit remake but, that's o.k. look how well the Office did.
I started watching this to see Sam, loved him in Detroit rock City. He would have been a great Spiderman! But, we got Andrew....he would have made a perfect Peter Parker (was a great Jimmie Olson) and judging by some of the scenes of this series, he would have filled out the Spidey suit just fine.",1
8,"Let me preface this by saying I have seen all the episodes of the BBC version. I love it. I also love the new US version.Anyone who has read anything about this show (rather than just taking to the internet to spew fury all over everywhere) knows that the US version will be following the UK version, roughly, as far as the end of the first series. The first 13 US eps will mirror the first 6 UK ones. None of the US writers or actors have seen any more of the UK show than the first 6 episodes in order to make the show different in later episodes. What I am interested in seeing is what the US version does after the first 13 episodes, because it will be ""original"". Hopefully.So far, the US version has made one important improvement on the UK version: the ""ghost"" rules (ie How Sally/Annie can interact with the world) are much clearer. Frankly, the extent to which other people in the UK version can interact with Annie has always been a little murky (read: plot-servicing). I enjoy the clarification of the rules in the US version. I am willing to see what else the US version does. Some things may be better, some things worse. Without giving the show a chance, we'll never know.It is important to note that SyFy (and Space, its Canadian buddy) primarily air reruns of old SciFi shows produced by others. Original in this context means they are producing it. Yes, linguistically tricky, but so is everything in Show Biz. Bear in mind that BSG was also a remake, just more time had passed and the series was darker. Also, excellent, which gives me hope for Being Human.I have no trouble watching both shows. Liking the US one doesn't take from liking the UK one. They both have humour, likable characters, and an engrossing storyline. If you like SciFi, Fantasy, or horror genres, give this show a whirl.",1
5,the uk version is so much better.Watch the original.,-1
10,"I don't know why people hate on this and prefer the original one better. Personally I like US version so much better and I don't think I would ever watch a UK one. I tried to but for me it was kind of boring and I didn't liked the actors either. This version is so much better and a little bit more mature. Alghought people who say that there is to much gore and blood clearly haven't seen True Blood or GOT, this is rated TV-14. The show itself is very addictive and I love Aidan's character but Nora for me is so annoying 😂😂😂",1
6,"Being a big fan of shows such as Charmed and currently Supernatural, I discovered this series (U.S. version) about a month ago. Right now I am getting caught up and am on Season 1. My initial impressions were that I didn't much like the characters or actors who play them. Aidan is the strongest most compelling character. Josh has grown on me a bit but not a whole lot. Sally I basically like and the actress does a good job with the role. I enjoy supernatural type movies and series that really focus on good fighting evil. However, I'm not sure that this series is necessarily about that.Though I realize Aidan, Josh and Sally are trying to live normal lives, and not give in to the monsters inside of them, still some of the stuff in particular, is a bit hard to take.Like Aidan and Rebecca having a bloody suck fest in the one episode, and in ""Going Dutch,"" I almost decided not to watch anymore when I saw one scene, with a very pregnant woman with her swollen belly exposed, laid out on a dining room table, and then finding out she was pg with twins, and she was there to be sustenance for the vampires gathered around her. I thought that was extremely disturbing. Although they never touch her beyond Bishop drawing some blood from her wrist, in the ensuing fight, the table she is lying on gets completely flipped over. Also disturbing was Rebecca turning Bernie, the little boy into a vampire. I knew what was coming in that episode, that Aidan would have to put him down. I'm not sure if I will continue to watch the entire series but will continue for the present. I want to see if Season 2 will be any better.",1
5,"When I first saw a commercial for this on Syfy, I couldn't wait! I hadn't known that this was a remake and thought it seemed like quirky comedy that's plot sounded like a punchline of a funny joke.But I was wrong. The episodes always answers ""It can't possibly get any worse"" with ""Oh yes it can!"" In almost of the episodes i've seen the show generally ends int he characters in a montage of sadness sitting in grey areas looking forlorn to depressing indie music thinking back upon the selfish mess that are their lives. Its just devastating to watch these characters have worse and worse lives. Only a couple characters stand out in this series too, and one would be Sally. I liked them all at first, but Josh just started to seem to strange to relate to at all and they started playing up the ""I can't help being dangerous"" thing with Aiden so much that he now just seems like a detestable, selfish character. Sally always just seemed to be the little beam of light in the show as I found her story the most interesting, but in the second season with all the disturbing and horrible things she's done and scene, her cute Sally humor is just most likely to fade. I used to like this show but there is no lightness and humor, and having the characters just being depressed doesn't make for a fun show to look forward too. I will tune in to watch the next season but I just can't see how anything is going to change.",-1
1,"If your interested in watching this, then maybe you should watch more porn movies. It really goes to far in depth with nudity and sex. It should of been a show that came on hbo or Showtime. It seems like the ratings of movies keep changing everyday. Before you know it they be able to show people naked on the local channels since its so close to it already. This seems like a mixture of a soap opera and a pornographic film, but a rated one. I still think that don't choose good actors in shows like these. It makes me wonder what they where thinking about. If they wanted to go that far in depth then they should've made a movie so the proper audience would watch it. Maybe they should of did a trial episode to see how much attention they would get. That way they could know if anybody will even want to waste their time to watch this nonsense.",-1
8,"We've been watching the UK version of this show on BBCA since day one and so far it is mildly entertaining but mainly flat and lifeless (like UK food). I really don't care what happens to any of the characters because they don't compel me to. But after only two episodes of the US version we are hooked. It is SO much better! It's funnier, more suspenseful and contains a lot more emotion than the limp Brit version. Hell, even the house they live in has more style and personality than the one in the UK. It actually looks like a ""haunted"" house vs. the drab flat embedded in the dull wall the Brits live in.And the male US actors are far superior to their Brit counterparts. While I enjoy Brit Lenora Crichlow as Annie and Aidan Turner is sufficient though lifeless (ironic for a vampire), Russell Tovey is just plain irritating as hell. The moment he walks on the screen, his nervous ticks and whiny voice drive me nuts. And his high-pitched girlish scream that freaking goes on forever makes me want to plunge a screwdriver in my ear.On the other end, were-guy Sam Huntington in the US is funny and endearing. His lack of social grace is hilarious, especially some of the awkward dialogue he spouts when he meets people for the first time. Sam Witwer, with his impossibly angular face that resembles characters from the MTV animated series Æon Flux"" (http://bit.ly/gNQbLs), has an odd, otherworldly appearance that is perfect for the role. He comes of as mysterious, yet likable, as opposed to the UK's Turner who comes of as a boring pretty boy. Meaghan Rath is great as Sally, but I like Crichlow just as much.On the downside, I prefer the guy in the UK version (don't know his name) as the bad guy vampire a lot more than Mark Pellegrino. The Brit actor comes off as truly menacing and dangerous, while Pellegrino is a nuisance at best. He's more like the old buddy who keeps getting you in trouble vs. the head of a vicious vampire network. He did a much better job as Lucifer in ""Supernatural"" and even his Jacob in ""Lost"" seemed spookier. Oh and he needs a damn haircut. That shaggy hairstyle does not suit him or the character.Anyway, I'll keep watching both, but so far the US version is my favorite.GO TEAM USA!",1
6,"I reluctantly watched this show since it appeared to be a True Blood mimic. I viewed the first season over a few days. With each episode of the first season I became less and less tolerant. Although there are some good story lines in this series, the Sally Malik's story line is a distraction, like a nail on a chalkboard. I don't know if it is the character or the actress but Sally's ""poor me,"" ""look at me,"" ""what about me"" is permeating through even the second season. Sally's character evokes little sympathy, unlike Aiden and Josh, whose struggles are compelling. In a addition to Sam Witwer and Sam Huntington, Mark Pellegrino is compelling as Bishop. All three of these actors have a promising career ahead of them. Giving this series a 5, mostly because of Sally. In short, the 20 something ghost is a good idea but this series would do far better without a Sally, a different Sally or a different ghost.",1
9,"After watching a few episodes of the BBC series, I found its development unbearably slow, and its scripting and acting equally unappealing. It was in a word, boring. However, I did like the basic concept. When ScyFy decided to present a North American version, I was willing to give it a try. The acting and writing are night-and-day better than the BBC production. The stories move along at a decent pace developing the characters in a way that the BBC series never did for me. I actually feel something for their plight, where I felt no connection at all with the British characters.I have read a lot of what I consider misleading reviews from Anglophiles denigrating the North American series and applauding the British version. This is why I felt obliged to write this review presenting an opposing opinion.",1
1,"I've never seen the original version, and as long as I have the bad taste in my mouth after watching this drek I'm not planning on doing that.Even though the premise is promising, the execution is beyond horrible. Acting is extremely bad, and every scene with the werewolf or the ghost is cringe worthy to say the least. Only Sam Witwer looks like he knows what he's doing. Everything has this sort of low budget feel to it, most of the sets feel sitcom-y, and everything looks like it was filmed with a hand-held camera. The writing would've been good, if the lines weren't completely butchered by the delivery of the actors. When the werewolf tried to be quirky and imitated a Irish accent, I changed the channel and skipped like 5 minutes of the show to collect my thoughts.Overall I highly recommend skipping this one.",-1
9,"Mr. Show is one of those rare sketch comedy shows that is actually funny.On top of that, they manage to tie each sketch to the previous one for added comedy goodness.The most important thing is that 20 years later, it's not dated.Try watching SNL from 20 years ago and most of the jokes don't make sense because they were about something that was only in the news for a week or two.Not the heavily edited SNL that plays on TV now, a full episode.You won't even recognize most of the people they parody.Proving that SNL has been a huge waste of videotape.Bob Odenkirk and David Cross are comedy geniuses who were smart enough to bring other great comedians to the show.People who would go on to huge success like Jack Black,Jay Johnston,Paul F. Tompkins,Brian Posehn,Tom Kenny(SpongeBob),Dino Stamatopoulos,Jerry Minor,Sarah Silverman,Mary Lynn Rajskub(Gail The Snail) and more great guest appearances than I could ever mention.It's amazing how unknown this show is considering everything Bob Odenkirk has done.He wrote for Letterman,Get A Life(Chris Elliot's show) and SNL.He has also been involved in producing,writing and acting in almost everything Tim & Eric have ever done, not to mention his involvement in many other Adult Swim shows.Watch this show.",1

10,"HBO for a short four seasons, ran this nearly flawless gem of a show to little or no fanfare, quietly this show fell again and again the woods of Friday at midnight, Sunday at 2AM, Monday at 11:30, Tuesday at 9:45 or wherever there was late night time to kill on HBO, building a following (and Emmy nominations) with ANYONE that took the time to watch it until executives canceled what they did not understand or know how to market.As a parody of a sketch show every scene blended seamlessly in an interesting mix of absurdist comedy and just outright funny over the top comedic performances. The show had a razor sharp subtext on society, counterculture and the entertainment world. It's witty writing provided a smart and fresh take on nearly every subject under the sun from mediocre comedians, rock music teen suicide to senators paying for sex with wooden craft fair puppets. I've never found a sketch show that could compare or span it's width or depth of complexity in 30 minutes.Impossible to define, no explanation can be given for this show but everyone I've taken the time to introduce the show is an instant fan after one or two episodes. Do yourself a favor and check out a season DVD of this show, I can nearly guarantee you'll be running out to find the other volumes and thankfully HBO wised up and released them in an acceptable format!I've yet to find a show as entertaining as this show. Perfect television. A show whose time came too soon, Bob and David, we hardly knew ye! Thank you for the ride.",1
10,"Mr. Show is one of those comedy runs that you actually have to think about. If you don't get it then watch it again. If you still don't, then turn on the latest reality crap and wallow in ignorance. It was, and still is, one of the funniest and most clever shows to ever exist. And, many of the comedians you will recognize not from a typical SNL terribly written sketch. These are not the Seth Rogan types of pseudo-comedy but actually funny people, great writers, and the humor makes sense...to most. HBO screwed up when they let this one slip away, but, that is good in a way (after all, look at what HBO has turned into!). There hasn't been many shows even close since and I would recommend to anyone to have a watch and judge for yourself.",1

Its destroys other funny sketch shows like In living color, SNL, The ben stiller show, monty python, dave chappelle, kids in the hall, and SCTV. Sketch comedy today is really weak.  Shows like mad tv and the current snl are very tired and unfunny.  Buy this show on dvd you won't be disappointed.",1
10,"One Man's Terrorist was originally released as a three part series on David West's youtube channel that was around 45 minutes long. He then edited it down to a one part video. I preferred the three part series, but none of the crucial plot points were edited out that I noticed. I highly recommend this video to anyone, but it is a must watch for those who have served in Iraq of Afghanistan. One Man's Terrorist is amazing for being a low budget short film. It is a very thought provoking and inspiring clip. As a veteran of two deployments to Iraq, it really makes you take a deeper look into what you were doing over there and how you viewed those that didn't like it.",1
3,"When the episode begins, it's 1940 and an American, Mr. Latimer, is in Britain on vacation. It seems that he has incredibly good luck and is rich....and one of the locals is irritated by this. So, he makes Latimer a bet that he cannot stay the entire night in a supposedly haunted room for one night. I could give you more details, but this might give away the twist...such as it is.To me, this episode seemed inferior for a variety of reasons...the biggest of which is the weakness of the script. The twist didn't seem at all believable and the episode seemed more silly than anything else.",-1
7,"What happens when you set a guy up properly to expect a ghost? Or set him up to suspect that the people with whom he has bet a great deal of money will try to scare him away. Two men, badly in need of money, hanging around a fancy men's club, trick a rich American into betting with them. They bet a thousand pounds he cannot spend the night in a haunted mansion. They give him a gun, a candle, and one match. They also leave a book with a scary story of two sisters in it. One thing leads to another and the man is led to hysteria. What happens next is the true issue in this story. How does he handle being scared out of his wits. This is during war time and the forces at work don't meet again for five years. See this. it's a good psychological study, although it is a bit predictable.",1
6,"The outcome of this story suggested two things to me. First, that the visiting American Latimer (Biff McGuire) was actually an escapee from the Sunnyview Sanitarium back in 1940 upon the first meeting with Hurstwood (Ralph Clanton) and his friend Derek (John Irving). Seeing that 'ghost' after accepting the bet to stay overnight in the haunted Hurstwood Manor would have only made his condition worse, evidenced by the man's hysteria on that frightful evening. The other of course, is that Latimer became unhinged after his ghostly experience, and wound up in the Sanitarium as a result of his stay at the Manor. The latter explanation is the one I think most viewers accept, but the first one I offer makes it more plausible that Latimer would have accepted the bet in the first place, especially after the oddball conditions were set down by Hurstwood. Either way, the 'winners' of the bet played it dirty, having taken Latimer's money because of their insistence that his passing out was tantamount to not staying the entire night in the haunted room. That was a pretty feeble justification on Hurstwood's part.",1

8,"Daddy Hitchcock, always willing to amuse with some fine television, prepared a ghastly prank called THE GENTLEMAN FROM America, with Biff McGuire; directed by Robert Stevens, based on a story by Michael Arlen, it features the ingenious story of a British noble and an American guy who's reputed to be rich and, as I said, the story seems ingenious—doubly ingenious—as to the British's trick and to the implausible twist (--a mental patient doesn't look, though, like a guest from America, here they blew it--). The actors are Biff McGuire, Ralph Clanton, John Irving. A British oldster, noble but not so rich, tricks an American into accepting a bet to spend a whole night into a haunted room. The bet is high, as the British squire needs money.The scene is Hurstwood Manor—1940, and then five yrs later. This play has that Hitchcokian air of creepiness.",1
8,"This first season Hitchcock half-hour is fairly typical of the earlier episodes of this long running suspense series, as to its cast, ambiance and darker than usual tone of the story it tells. It starts out as a seemingly light tory about an American abroad, a young man, not terribly intelligent, though wealthy all the same (typical Hitch take on Yanks) who has been gambling up a storm in the England of 1940, when the world war was still ""phoney"", to the English speaking world anyway. Two English gentlemen of medium sophistication, and low on funds, propose a wager to the young man that he cannot spend a night in a bedroom of Hurstwood manor. He is told that he must remain in the room overnight, and is given only a candle, one match, a pistol and, if he pleases, a book that tells the ""terrible story"" that caused the manor to become haunted. If the Yank stays in the room all night he will win a thousand pounds. Unwisely, the American takes the wager, then proceeds upstairs with surprisingly little fuss or bother.There is also a bit of information mentioned earlier about a nearby lunatic asylum, and I don't see this as a spoiler, as, while there is some foreshadowing of what shall happen later on in the tale, it's near impossible for a first time viewer to guess the signifacence of it. The prospect, in this story, of gambling, an early wartime setting, a young American abroad, and out of his element, a ghost, and madness, is a tantalizing one even as the first half of the episode is otherwise somewhat prosaic and unremarkable. Things turn, literally, darker, in the second half, yet there's also some confusion for even a seasoned Hitchcock show viewer, as the ""set-up"", or introduction (as it were) is quite complicated as to the terms of the wager, and how or whether a ghost would react to being shot at. Nor is it made wholly clear who is going to be staying in this large manor house to ensure that the American will stick to his part of the bargain, and if he doesn't, how they can know. The episode pays off in the end, though it could have been a whole lot better with some different players and a better script. Michael Arlen's short story was a good one, yet the epsode, while above average in most respects, feels a bit second tier for this particular television series.",1
5,"I'm a long-time Hitchcock fan, both movies and TV, but I've always thought his later one-hour TV shows were much better, with more irony and humor. That said, I do enjoy many of the early 30-minute series, although to me some sort of fall a little short. ""The Gentleman from America"" is one of those that, for me, are not as good as some others. The plot is rather simple on the surface. A couple of British guys bet an American that he can't stay the night in a haunted room. The American at first doesn't think they're serious. After all, there's no such thing as a ghost, right? But the two British guys seem really serious and offer to bet quite a bit of money. The American takes the bait -- I mean, the bet. Now, to me this is where it sort of falls apart. First of all, if someone tried to bet me a lot of money that I wouldn't stay the night in a ""haunted room,"" I'd know right off the bat that something was up, for two reasons. One, there are no ghosts. Two, they're way too anxious to bet a lot of money. And if, on top of that, they made ridiculous conditions -- I can only have one candle and one match, but I can have a gun -- I'd know I was being had. It's the simple fact that the American ignores these things that sort of spoiled it for me. Sort of, not totally, because (a) I'm a sucker for a ghost story, and (b) I was curious to know the outcome. In the end, it falls flat, as our American hero manages to extinguish his only candle and then practically loses his mind when confronted by a pretty obviously fake ghost. Sorry, Hitch.",-1
10,"Kascha is a Goddess in porn. Rarely makes a bad movie. The two scenes featuring her are blistering. Love her enthusiasm in this particular movie. Lots of lovely camera work and some beautiful close ups. Music during scenes isn't too loud either. Both scenes are very different and they are not too short. Pity Kascha made so few films, but this is one of her very best. Her hair, body and face are perfect for porn. Other scenes are average, but the stars of this are Kascha and Francois as they turn out the best scenes by far. Clothes come fully off on Kascha, not like some of her other films. Another to wait patiently for to come out on DVD!",1
4,"The first show I reviewed and slated it, but I must confess it's growing on me. Despite the actors being totally annoying and over made up there is the bones for a good sci fi series. What won't grow on me is the unprofessionalism of a team of astronauts sent to save the world, put a uniform on and say yes sir.",-1
7,"Episode 2 picks up where the pilot left off. The now damaged ship is running low on oxygen so the crew must source it somewhere close to their position in space in order to survive. Back on earth Erik & his team make little headway trying to figure out the purpose of the terrestrial alien that seems to mimic music.To me, this episode felt right out of Star Trek Enterprise. A crew that has not yet melded together, a great unknown and of course danger everywhere. A new addition makes an appearance. I can understand why folks might be frustrated at this point.I will agree with some that the crew is questionably assembled. For being supposedly military organization, or perhaps more fittingly the science arm of a military organization it seems to me that it would have been easier for some folks if they had gone with uniforms and military style space command, but perhaps they were trying to break away from shows like that which have already been done plenty.Sure I have lots of questions, some of which should have been answered already like what year is it, and who or what William actually is. Some of us however like mysteries we have to solve for ourselves and do not appreciate nor need every detail spoon fed to us. I for one am going to soldier on and keep watching. No show is ever perfect in its first few episodes. At this point I will say without spoiling anything that if they go in the direction where the end of this episode seems to lead, I will be very disappointed.",1
2,"As none of my friends were foolish enough to watch this past episode one, I feel the need to review to properly share the contempt and horror I feel for this production.This second episode improves nothing over the first.Again, the crew are completely unlikable and shockingly insubordinate. Again, every single person manages to disobey the most minor orders attempting to keep them alive without a single valid reason to do so. There remain massive science errors any technical adviser should have caught.At this point, the best hope for all of humanity is probably for William to vent the atmosphere and handle the mission himself.",-1
1,"What a waste of wonderful technical effects and space age sets. The crew are just a bunch of squabbling kids ,where expressing their feelings matters more than fixing the oxygen leak. They all deserve to die and if they behaved like that in a real situation they would.There are dozens of talented people out there with good storytelling skills so why waste all the money on this bunch of clowns?",-1
3,"Bad science. Bad casting. Bad acting. Bad writing. Bad premise.Seriously, the idea of having such a pouty, inexperienced, yet good looking crew with no discipline is ridiculous. The scientific mistakes are so frequent that this series seems to have been written by science deniers.Watch if you have 10 hours to waste.",-1
5,"Others have questioned the validity of the science, and rightly so. I have just one question or maybe two. Is there traveling faster than light how were they able to communicate? Some unknown subspace channel like Stargate? And traveling faster than light as far as they are going how old will her daughter be when she gets back? The same age as her mom?",-1
5,"I'm tolerating the show despite some of its problems. However, when the producers/writers include things that clearly insult our intelligence, that is where I draw the line. For example, Niko does something to Ian that shocks the crew. William seems very confused by this act and even somewhat distracted. Later, William is confronted by Niko, and rather than just telling him why she did what she did, Niko basically changes the subject and walks away, leaving William even more bewildered. This is NUTS! Anyone else clearly would have told William that there were no other options available, and also explaining why there were no other options (which I will not reveal here).",-1
1,Is because all remaining viewers did not care about the ridiculousness and errors in science and space technology.. nor were they bothered by the terrible dialogues and childish behaviour of the crew. At least after the mid section bullying the commander I decided to leave this series for good.,-1
10,"Well it could be more real if you actually went there (if you did, I'm pretty certain you appreciate the way this was made). But not having been there and only being able to judge this from afar, this feels close to a documentary, in a very good sense that is.It is only 7 episodes long and the makers of Wire are behind it as the discs did not fail to state. This is way different than the Wire though. This is about war, this is about a generation and how they got ""hoaxed"" into a war. This is how people view things, what their expectation was and how leadership can be quite failed. Putting the wrong people in charge, not having checked their psychology can lead to quite the disaster. Even if not, it is quite awful to watch what one of the people who commands others does himself.But war does do certain things to a person. Depending on what they want to do, they mental state, they might go overboard. And the series throws you, without much explanation. It is confusing and irritating ... it is also gold and a must see watch.",1
10,"Having loved The Wire I was interested to see how its producers would deal with the subject of war. Obviously this series is quite different, after all it is only eight episodes long rather than five seasons. It also has a much smaller cast as it follows a small group of US Marines from the desert of Saudi Arabia where they are waiting to go to war to the streets of Baghdad where they realise that even though they've won the war winning the peace will be another thing altogether.The series makes no concession to those who don't know military terminology which makes it all seem very real to the viewer. One might expect a series about war to be non-stop action with our heroic protagonists valiantly battling the enemy while saving women and children caught in the cross fire... not here though most of the time is spent driving or just sitting around and when there is action they are just as likely to be engaging some poor civilian who is in the wrong place at the wrong time as an enemy combatant. I know some people found the inaction boring but I was gripped from start to finish.The series managed to walk a fine line avoiding both the glorification of war and the demonisation of those involved in this unpopular war. Our heroes aren't depicted as angels, they each have their flaws but also they each have their charms.Surprisingly for a series about such a serious subject there are quite a few laugh out loud moments, I particularly laughed in an early episode when they were finding about what was going on by listening to the BBC News... complete with cricket commentary.",1
10,One of the best shows ever. At least the first episode is. Well actually I didn't really watch much of it but I'm told it was good. I was too busy stealing ice creams from the freezer at work and writing silly stuff on the fridge door.,1
10,"Brilliant war drama.The story of 1st Marine Reconnaissance Battalion's participation in the second Allied invasion of Iraq, in 2003. Seen through the eyes of Rolling Stone reporter Evan Wright, who was embedded with the Battalion and upon whose book the series is based.Though dramatized, this is pretty much a warts-and-all account of a military unit in combat. Hardly glamorous, it shows well the problems they face, both external and internal. Not all drama and explosions - there are many great comedic moments, especially in the dialogue.Accurate, engrossing and entertaining.",1
10,"Having seen a lot of American war movies, I had expected an emotional tale of courageous heroes fighting and dying for their country and ideals. However, being an HBO series (thank you for existing, people!) the film was realistic, consistent and complex in a non flashy way.Imagine a reconnaissance team of marines going into Iraq in 2003 after extensive training, only to become the victim of the bureaucracy and politics of the military. The few people fighting them are unskilled and ill equipped fanatics who die slaughtered in their hundreds without landing a shot. The bleak story of 21 days in which the American military totally won the war in Iraq, only to lose gradually whatever glory they have earned in the process.Let me reiterate that the story is not a combat story, but a character piece and a situation piece. Unlike other people, I don't think it was meant to criticize the military beyond the truth. It showed the good and the mostly bad, the pathetic squirming of humans placed in different situations.As a professional software engineer I can't help but notice the resemblance of the military structure to that of tech companies, complete with office politics and lack of communication between leadership levels. The problem is the clients of this ""military company"" are the American and Iraqi civilians, and they get screwed in the end.",1
7,"As a believable portrait of what it was really like to fight in the last Iraq war, 'Generation Kill' hits the target; yet as devotee of writer David Simon's brilliant previous series, 'The Wire', I have to say that in contrast, it left me feeling a little underwhelmed. Partly it may just be that the Marines who comprise its leading characters are a little less varied (and therefore interesting) than the people of Baltimore; each one is individually cast, but there's a sense of a common mould which probably reflects real-life recruitment but which also gives the series a mono-tonal air. Another issue is that there isn't much of a story. Thankfully, the liberal Simon eschews a ""glorious march to victory"" narrative, but in its place, there are just a lot of scenes of marines advancing, sometimes bravely, sometimes boredly, sometimes badly, without a clear sight of the broader picture but with growing a growing sense of unease that it makes no sense. Again, this may be both accurate, and the specific point that Simon wanted to make; but it's hard to tell a story without a narrative of some sort, and even many of the specific incidents that could be told in complete form are instead sampled. Too often, we see men engaged in a threatening mission, then there's a clean cut to the next day, back at base, where they talk about their escape. This leaves the emphasis more on the macho male banter than the nominal action. It could just be that to this viewer (at least as liberal as Simon himself), there's simply no news here - the drama doesn't tells me much about the U.S. Marines, or the war in Iraq, that I didn't already suspect. Or at least, it doesn't quite tell me enough to justify over seven hours of TV, even though it's well-made and serious. 'The Wire' eventually justified its 60-odd hours; 'Generation Kill', however, might have been better as two than seven.",1
10,"This mini-series was what the film The Hurt Locker should have, a interesting, well written series about the Iraqi war and the soldiers involved. This is an adaption of the fact based book by Evan Wright who was a reporter for Rolling Stone during the war.The focus of the series is on First Reconnaissance Battalion's Bravo Company of the Marines, a Battalion that leads the line for the invasion of Iraq in 2003. It starts of like Band of Brothers, where you get to know the characters before the invasion and are introduced to Evan Wright (Lee Tergesen), the reporter. When the invasion happens the main focus is on Second Platoon led by Sgt. Brad 'Iceman' Colbert (Alexander Skarsgård), an intelligence man who cares about men, and treats the Iraqis with respect. He is the most sympathetic character throughout the series. As the Americans invade the country it's clear there was no real military planning, with no plans, tactics or intelligence. There are also undersupplied throughout the invasion. It was lucky that the Iraqis were even worst. Colbert often has to question orders he has been given by officers who seem lack knowledge. Within the ranks some of the Marines are very trigger happy and gung-ho, who see the invasion as an adventure. They so no respect to the locals, calling them by racist terms which I don't like to replete. Some take weapons and helmets as trophies. They reminded me of some people at university in the Officer Training Corp (OTC), and they were basically dicks. After the Americans win the war the situation doesn't improve. They is no post war planning involving helping prevent basic services, non any understanding of the Iraqi people.There is a great team involved with Generation Kill, it had David Simon from the Wire as a writer and production, with Ed Burns from the Wire as a writer. The writing is excellent, no just with plots or stories (which they have to stick to the facts), but all brilliant dialogue and ideas about why America was in Iraq and the ethics of war. It also tries to show a mix picture within the military where people are good and bad, whilst the Iraqis are simply the enemy in the distances. There is an excellent cast, Alexander Skarsgård will be following his father's footsteps. As well the writing and acting there is fine direction throughout the film, giving you information about what is happening in the wider world, and there are decent action scenes.The series itself reminded me of the excellent Band of Brothers, and if you like then you will love Generation Kill.",1
10,"Tecumseh Sherman would have given this series 10 stars, I'm sure. Highly entertaining and informative, it tells of the ill-fated Iraq War which any sane person today would say was a total disgrace. Wright definitely sided with the enlisted grunts and portrayed the officers as mostly morons or psychos or both. The series was quite a bit more political than the book.I thought that the football game in the last episode was a brilliant bit of story telling. I also think that the game of football contributes to the violent nature of America.Generation Kill is one of the best series I've ever seen, perhaps THE best. The casting was so spot on that it couldn't have been improved upon. The dialogue at every step of the narrative was filled with humor, insight into the military culture, and tells the viewer a lot about what it is like to be at war.",1
9,"I'm Not gonna Lie i liked this one more than Band of Brothers, Maybe Because i've seen Band of Brothers a Long time Ago i don't even remember The Atmosphere of the Show Anymore, But A Rewatch Gonna Fix That.
Anyway About Generation Kill i Found it Very Very Entertaining and Educational, and simply one of the best Mini-Series i've ever Seen.",1
9,"As a US Marine I can pretty much relate to everything that went on in this series... From the banter among low ranks, to the stupid games we have to endure, to living in terrible conditions, it's all here. To weapons jamming and MRI's, this series really has it all. The thing that caught my attention was how they captured the terrible leadership at times from the powers that be. I'm here to tell you there is some pitiful officers leading men into battle. And then you have some outstanding NCO's that make things happen. This series shows it all and from my perspective, this is probably as close as it gets to the real thing. Wanna be a United State Marine? This will give you a little insight on what it's like after bootcamp. Some great actors in this show and have to give all the credit to the producers and director. Guarantee they had real Marines on set making sure they got things as accurate as they were allowed. This was a solid solid series and will watch it again and again... man I miss being around my Brothers and everything that goes with being a Marine... Semper Fi Rudy!!!",1
6,"This is a realistic, professional, well filmed, well scripted, well directed and very well produced mini-series.But, (unfortunately there is a big 'but') it is also a very finely politicized piece of work. It is not the usual ""in your face"" denigration of the war and / or US foreign policy in general, but a carefully woven net into which most unsuspecting viewers are very likely to fall into. It's not only that it is an anti-war film, which in itself would be fine, but in essence it is a very Anti-American film. I would very much like to (and will) read the book in order to be able to understand whether this was a direction given by the author or by the show's writers / producers. I believe it was probably a little of both.I refuse to believe that almost the entire USMC Officer Cadre is a bunch of babbling, incompetent idiots. If this where true as depicted in the movie, I cannot see how they could have won any war, not just this one in Iraq in the time that they did (I will leave the issue of the Post-war management fiasco out of this review as it is not pertinent to the movie, and would just like to remind the reader of this article that the Iraq campaign the mini series is dealing with was unanimously acclaimed as one of the best planned, fastest, and most successful military campaigns of all time). I refuse to believe that there are Captains not only within the USMC but in one of it's most elite units of the likes of 'Captain America' that are left in command after committing the things depicted in 'Generation Kill'. Such an incompetent and cowardly person would never even pass a preliminary screening for any job, let alone become a Captain of one of the most elite military units in the world... And then the other officers portrayed... it is simply ridiculous!In other, the series is affected by another 'modern' grievance. It believes that soldiers (especially Americans) are supposed to philosophically interpret the reasons behind every shot they are to fire before doing so in order to maintain their 'high ground'. Well, unfortunately wars do not work like that. Wars have always been and will always be without exception an ugly, bloody, unfair mess where only the strongest survive (""Homo Homini Lupus"" the Ancient Romans used to say). A perfect example is a scene in the series where a sergeant on a roadblock fires a smoke grenade toward an approaching vehicle in order to warn it and avoid having to shoot at it (an honorable gesture in order to avoid civilian casualties), but the grenade accidentally bounces of the ground and hits in the head an old Iraqi peacefully walking on the side of the road, killing him instantly. The movie uses this and other such examples in order to portray the US forces as incompetent, uncaring and sometimes downright blood thirsty. I will not deny that any and all armies have such individuals in their midst, and US armed forces are certainly not without them. But to me, the above mentioned incident only goes to show that tragedies occur in war, even when instigated by the noblest of intentions, let alone in the midst of combat.It is on such occasions and its insistence on preaching such pseudo moral issues that ""Generation Kill"" miserably fails the test of reality, and that makes it a much lesser movie than it rightfully could and should have been.",1
10,"Generation Kill is a one-of-a-kind seven part mini series that features an authentic warts and all, no punches pulled take on the 2003 Invasion of Iraq told through the eyes of the United States Marine Corps' 1st Reconnaissance Battalion and the Rolling Stones reporter assigned to write a story on the US Marines and their various experiences during their tour of duty in Iraq.While the Marines struggle with inadequate supplies, behind the scenes bureaucratic power plays, and poor communication they kill the time with pizza, pranks, keeping fit, insulting each other, fantasising about killing the enemy, and proving themselves amongst their fellow marines as well as their family and friends at home by being involved in spearheading a campaign that has divided the USA and around the world following the fateful events of September 11. Despite a majority of the time spent in ""stop and start"" moments as well as the dreaded waiting around, when it comes time for switch on they do so when they come under threat or when they successfully take down any enemy combatants.The cast is brilliant. If you are patient with the storyline it will pay off in the end. There is a mixture of comedic, dramatic, horrific and Those that have served in the military will empathise and understand not only what its like on deployment but what it is like to be undersupplied and screwed around by the chain of command as well as serving with a variety of members that are either likable or downright annoying and Generation Kill nails this with the utmost authenticity.Based on the true to life novel by Evan Wright, Generation Kill is brought to life on the television screen and thoroughly deserves its critical acclaim. Generation Kill was also a very rewarding experience and certainly one of my favourite mini series that I had the pleasure of watching.Reward yourself and check this mini series out.10/10.",1
8,Not with this crew though. I thought very over dramatic at times but a good action series.,1
4,"It seems that the people best positioned to enjoy the series (any incoincidences, goofs etc aside) are USMC members who participated in the Second Iraq War; followed by USMC members period; then - by US military members; then - by NATO military members and American civilians; then - by non-American military members. I come from a further group still - non-American civilians with a casual interest in the military. Being in that group, the best I can call the series is ""intentionally obtuse"" - it's generously peppered with American military abbreviations, slang and imperial units throughout without any footnotes or termlists before an episode's beginning, let alone something more involved such as the reporter character asking: ""So what is ""Oscar Mike""? What are ""Mikes""? What are ""klicks""? What is the diffrence between NVGs and thermals (?), why are some better and others work even without batteries somehow?"" etc. The subtitles gave about 1% of the clarity I needed. There are a lot of American cultural references as well, and a ton of characters who have unclear ranks and converging roles, made even more difficult by how similar everybody looks. This might seem like nitpicking as I wouldn't expect a military to have 4 guys all in one command vertical with each one's hair painted a different anime colour, but come on, at least give us some documentary-style ""Lt. S. Uch-and-such, platoon coomander of Bravo"" banners or whatever, when characters outside of our ""Hitman 2-1"" guys, the Godfather, Rudy, Sixta, the Lt. of our guys, Meesh, that ""Assassin"" leader (""Assassin Actual""?) and the streetwise black guy appear, at least the first 3-4 times. These are honest to god the only characters I could tell apart for 90% of the show. That might look like a lot, written out like that, but that's , like, a fifth of them at best, and they literally all have some role in some thing, and look exactly the same.So are the characters I can't tell apart any good? No, they're cliche cardboard cutouts, and those of them who are officers are completely incompetent in literally every single thing they do. What about the characters I can tell apart? They are mostly interesting to follow, other than Sixta, who is deliberately repulsive and infuriating in nearly every scene where he appears. Person, the driver of ""Hitman 2-1"" is an especially great character, who has some of the best and wittiest speeches of the series, and dialogues are good in general. The Godfather, another super interesting character, represents the morally-grey command, whose orders seem incompetent at times but are always logically justifiable in the context of the situation, provided he deigns to explain his reasoning.The confusion, lack of information and disorder of war/combat are shown excellently, although I do wonder if perhaps the incompetence of the command is overexaggerated in many parts (even as some is well-attested, such as no desert camo, vulnerable Humvees etc). The visuals are superb, and the combat and the calm both do very much align with what videos of American servicemen I've seen on Youtube. Everything is very realistic on that front.However, the characters all kind of degenerate towards the end, and behave inexplicably oftentimes; and there is a lot of unpleasant nonsense throughout (we get a close up of a urine stream of a marine relieving himself around five times or so throughout the series - wouldn't one be kind of enough?). So altogether, if it was more cohesive, better footnoted and less cliched... it would've been pretty good indeed, but it's not in its actual state.",-1
7,"Do not go into this series expecting the explosion-fests seen in Band of Brothers and Black Hawk Down. Generation Kill instead centres its storyline around two main premises: the waiting involved in modern warfare, and the incompetency of those in positions of power. In this sense, Jarhead is a far more similar story - for example, a common theme throughout is the eagerness the marines have to finally see combat, and at least ""Shoot their first Hajis"".Generation Kill excels at this; deadpan acting from Skarsgard (before worldwide fame) and slightly crazed soldiers sprinkled throughout give a sense of the monotonous madness of war fare today. However, the real boon of this series is highlighting bad decision making. Throughout the episodes, constant backtracking, poor intel and superiors making selfish decisions hamper all efforts to make progress, whilst also reducing confidence in those higher up in command. As this continues, a growing sense builds that, not only is this war a losing battle, but that no progress is ever truly made.Generation Kill is thus a testament to strong, truthful filmmaking, lending itself strongly not just to the brief but hectic gunfights, but also to the lesser-explored emotional side of war, from the perspectives of the elite forces engaging",1
10,"What you get to see here is a one-of-a-kind mini-series: this is as close to a documentary as it gets. The realities of modern warfare are shown honestly with no political agenda and you are left to draw your own conclusions. When I watched this series I remembered a quote from another film, 'The Siege' from 1998, where Bruce Willis' character, a high ranking army official, says something along the lines of: ""The army is a broad sword - not a scalpel. So trust me, you do not want to call the army, unless you have absolutely no other option"". From an artistic point of view what stands out the most is the ensemble of actors. Not once during the entire seven episodes did I not believe I was watching the actual characters - the performances and the direction in this production are flawless. I've never seen a series that felt as real as this. This goes beyond mere entertainment - this is simply the best contemporary television has to offer. 10 out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",1
10,"I had heard of ""Generation Kill"" when it premiered in 2008, but was unable to view since I do not have HBO. So I forgot about it for a while until some time ago I was looking around at the local library when I just happened to sight this little, television masterpiece, and decided, especially in light of what the result of our adventure in Iraq has been in the last few years, to give it a chance. And though I can't say ""Generation Kill"" was necessarily my favorite viewing experience, I'm glad I did. Based off of the memoirs of a Rolling Stone reporter embedded with the 1st Marine Recon Unit during the first days of the US invasion of Iraq, it begins on the eve of that faithful event by introducing the viewer to the men of 1st Marine Recon (many of whom are based off of real life Marines), their code, standards, and every day experience. When they learn that the invasion is going ahead, they also learn that a reporter from Rolling Stone will be coming with them. Initially reluctant to having a greenhorn tag along with them, they warm up to the young writer when they learn he used to write for Penthouse, a magazine many of these young, red blooded males are familiar with! Through the production, we see the course of events through the eyes of the Marines and their ""hang around"" in a the most unsugar coated method possible, and we come away with no illusions about what war is really like.What makes ""Generation Kill"" so different from other war productions is the fact that it strips away the unnecessary fluff and puff and presents the story in an almost character ensemble/documentary style. In ""Generation Kill"" there is no music score or opening theme, only the crackle and chatter of voices over the radio greets us at the beginning and end credits of each episode, multiple units and men sounding off into the dead of night, which truth be told, is far more effective than any music theme could be (That being said, the final scenes of the last episode feature a most appropriate use of Johnny Cash's ""The Man Comes Around"", the only recorded song used in the entire series). There is also not much in the way of heroics or glory for the simple reason that in war, there is none to be found. There are no eagles soaring, or glory sounding tunes, or any other BS like that; only following the orders of your superiors (Even if they're complete fools or incompetent), hurrying up and waiting, and of course, death and destruction. And that last part is especially evident in ""Generation"", as the series pulls no punches in regards to the civilian ""collateral damage"" that occurred in Iraq during our invasion, and thus shows the cost civilians pay when armies, even with the best of intentions, come charging into their environment in a combat role (To those who think US troops patrolling troubled neighborhoods would be a good idea, I challenge them to watch this and then try to argue for that idea!). All of this is effectively shown through the tremendous efforts of the directors, producers, show runners, writers, and actors such as Jon Huertas, Alexander Skarsgard, Lee Tergesen, Stark Sands, Neal Jones, Michael Kelly, Chance Kelly, former real life 1st Marine Rudy Reyes, James Ransone, and many, many more who I don't have the space for. To round it up, ""Generation Kill"" is a mini-series that leaves nothing to the imagination when it comes to the chaos and absurd nature of conflict, be it Iraq or anywhere else. As one former Marine commented here, this is the closet thing to war short of going there and actually filming it. For a former service member to say that, you know they did something right here. If you want to see what the reality of conflict without actually being there, then check out ""Generation Kill"". Stay frosty.",1
10,"Honest look at what went on in America's war for ""Iraqi Freedom"". The series is from the point of view of First Recon Marines. It gives us a realistic look of modern warfare, the combat is the most authentic i have come across, it doesn't hype the action for cinematic values. Be warned you won't get to see much of action but when it happens it's tense. As in real life so in series the Marines are made up of unique characters, there are capable as well as dumb officers. The soldiers come from different background and races, there are Mexicans, South Americans, Blacks, Rednecks, some are educated, some joined out of patriotism, some were given choice between jail term or marine school. Everyone's brain tuned in differently, the only thing common between them are the unity of brotherhood and them being highly trained killers.For me the best part and the highlight of the series are the humors and sarcastic banter among the soldiers. After watching the series I did some research and found out most of the names and designation are from real people and actual facts.In fact two of guys played themselves.The series is pretty much controversy free which is surprising considering it shows some stuff which the Government would have liked kept out of limelight.Do watch it, it's fun as well as education.",1
10,"Why did this excellent series only ever get one season, its it a simlzr vien to Over There. Which also was just exceptional.Why do the great only last for 1 or 2 seasons.",1
8,"It is an account of a rolling stone reporter about the days he spent with many recon marines during the invasion of Iraq in 2003. It is based on a book by Evan Wright, which was published in 2004, describing his experience of the war. It is a seven-part series with hour length episodes.The series succeeded in presenting the real picture of the war in front of us. It is not just the stories of heroics shown by the first recon marines, it is a presentation of a part of their life when they were there and how they tried to cope with it. One of the best things about it is that there is almost no theatricality. We follow a number of characters with the totally different psyche. Some want to kill everything they see, some are incompetent for their post, some hide their nervousness with jokes and some just want this war to end. War brings them all together. When they fight, race, color, religious or sexual orientation doesn't matter. But this war is also taking some of them away from humanity as well. The series successfully showed that the operation undertaken in Iraq was far from perfect.The series follows Sgt. Brad 'Iceman' Colbert and his team. Iceman is the representation of sanity in the turmoil of the war, which is played by Alexander Skarsgard pretty efficiently. Other than that, I really liked the parts played by Stark Stands (Lt. Nathaniel Fick), Chance Kelly ( Lt. Col. Stephen 'Godfather' Ferrando), Eric Nenninger ( Cpt. Dave 'Captain America' McGraw) and Rudy Reyes (Sgt. Rodolfo 'Rudy' Reyes).Sure, it's not ""Band of Brothers"", but it is a great watch if you want to look beyond what we were told about the situation in Iraq at that time.",1
7,"This is a tale of the competition between Consuelo(Gianna Canale): daughter of a retiring successful pirate captain, and William(Anthony Steel): one of his crew, and Consuelo's boyfriend, to succeed the old man as captain of the Santa Maria. The competition begins with William's victory over another man, in a sword duel, then Consuelo's victory over William. No one challenged her, so she was declared the new captain. It's also the story of the ambition of Anne, Duchess of a Spanish principality, and her retainer: Robert, together and separately, to steal a fortune in booty, hidden by the old captain, whose location was known only by the dead captain, Consuelo, and William.....
The film was produced by an Italian concern, directed by Luigi Capuano, who earlier had directed the rather similar ""Queen of the Pirates"", also starring the beautiful Gianna Canale. I'm also familiar with the Hollywood films ""Anne of the Indies"" and ""Against All Flags"", which also feature a tigress as a pirate captain......If you're looking for a classic sea battle or 2 between a pirate ship and it's prey, this isn't the right film. There are several massive battles between the pirates and the Spanish, but they are either on land, or between Spanish and pirates already on the same ship. 
 After Consuelo was decreed the new captain, her father:' The Tiger of the Sea' was knifed in the back, dying. The knife was identified as belonging to William, hence he was the assumed murderer, perhaps disappointed that he wasn't chosen the new captain. He was about to be sentenced to death when a horde of Spanish soldiers overran the pirates on land. William and a few other pirates ran toward the Santa Maria, and sailed off. Consuelo and a few other pirates also escaped, but missed the Santa Maria Thus, Consuelo had 2 big reasons to catch William and the Santa Maria. had two . They rowed a small boat out to sea. Soon, an armed Spanish ship was sighted. Next thing we know, Consuelo and the others were on that ship(How did they board her?), and soon staged a rebellion, taking over the ship, which became Consuelo's pirate ship. Soon, she attracted more men, and became known as the Tigress of the Seven Seas, as her ship was quite successful in subduing prey. Eventually, the Santa Maria came close, but William raised the white flag. He came on board to parlay with Consuelo, convincing her that he was not the murderer of her father, despite the damning physical evidence. He also said he meant to turn over the 
Santa Maria to Consuelo. However, this didn't happen immediately, instead they got caught up in an attack on Anne's castle, where the murderer of Consuelo's father was though to be......I will skip over the details of the adventures in and around Anne's castle. I will say, that, surprisingly, Anne achieved her ambition. Consuelo also achieved her goal of killing the murderer of her father(whom you should recognize). As to whether she achieved her goal of making peace with William, finally becoming captain of the Santa Maria, the film leaves us hanging, as they bicker. A reasonable solution to the conflict as to who would command the Santa Maria would have been to have Maria continue captaining her very successful Spanish ship, with the two ships forming a team......See it at YouTube",1
7,"Consuelo, is the only one, who can take the command of the 'Santa Maria' after the death of the captain. Now she runs a sharp blade on the rides with the proud ship. But she is not the only one, who wants to have authority on board.",1

8,"Following on from Örnek's previous film GELİBOLU (2005), DEVRİM ARABALARI (THE CARS OF THE REVOLUTION) looks once again at the pitfalls of nationalism, concentrating especially on bureaucracies.Following the military coup of 1960, General Cemal Gürsel (Sait Genay) looks for some means to reinforce Turkish nationalism as a means of uniting a divided country. He sponsors a project conducted in the central Anatolian city of Eskişehir to build Turkey's first automobile - the Devrim (or Revolution). A team of crack engineers is assembled under the leadership of Gündüz (Taner Birsel) and told that they have just 130 days to complete the project. The film concentrates on the team's trials and tribulations as they strive to fulfill the brief.Örnek draws a direct parallel between the birth of the automobile and the birth of engineer Necip's (Onur Ünsal's) first child to his wife Nilüfer (Seçil Mutlu). She experiences labor pains before the birth, but after a long while the child appears, much to the engineers' delight. Lıkewise the automobile finally appears after a long gestation period, but is rendered still-born during a humiliating ceremony at the Ankara Meclis (Parliament building) when one of the prototypes runs out of gas with General Gürsel in the front seat. The newspapers have a field day with headlines such as ""The Revolution Didn't Work,"" signaling the demise of the project.Örnek suggests that the principal cause of this mishap was the intransigence of the government bureaucrats led by Sami (Uğur Polat). Ostensibly they are worried about the spiraling costs of the project, but in truth they resent the idea that General Gürsel is making decisions on his own without consulting them. Hence they try every strategy in the book to derail the project: the final indignity in the Meclis was entirely their responsibility. In a series of significant exchanges, Latif, one of the engineers (Selçuk Yöntem) explains to Necip that in Turkey everyone is out to destroy success, mostly out of spite. Hence the country's industry cannot develop in any significant way.Although set over half a century ago, DEVRİM ARABALARI makes trenchant criticism of a mindset that still prevails today in government circles. No one, it seems, is really interested in radical change, for fear of their own futures; and they will make every effort to destroy the efforts of others, either by dragging their feet or by direct sabotage. We sympathize with Gündüz and his faithful band of brothers, as they understand that the project was ultimately not designed to serve the nation, but rather to increase their own sense of self-worth. It was worth doing, as it brought a group of disparate personalities together and created a community of purpose as a result.",1
5,"Turkish filmmaker Tolga Örnek follows the success of historically documentaries ""Hittites"" and ""Gallipoli"" with this curious but compelling docudrama recreation of the race by the engineers of the State Railroad Directorate at Eskişehir, following the 1961 coup d'état by Cemal Gursel, to build the first Turkish automobile.Haluk Bilginer is resplendent as the idealistic and obsessive head of the project whose passion seems to single-handedly drive the project whilst Taner Birsel shines as the strongest member of a supporting cast that includes Vahide Gördüm, Seçil Mutlu, and a wonderful turn from Sait Genay as Cemal Gursel himself.The director along with fellow screenwriter Murat Disli use a simple yet successful procedural approach to great effect to follow the production of the ""Devrim"" car from its inception to it's bittersweet final test whilst never losing track of the fascinating characters behind its creation in a surprisingly moving story.In Turkey no success is left unpunished.",-1
9,"""Devrim Arabalari"" is one of the best period movies Turkish cinema ever produced, with its fascinating screenplay, well-built and portrayed characters, and an inspiring story. The movie tells the story of the Turkish attempt to build a ""national automobile"" in the 1960s, shortly after the military coup that replaced a ""pro-American authoritarian democracy"" with an ""independent-minded libertarian junta"" (Yes, you read it right). Main protagonists are the idealist engineers of the State Railroad Directorate, who undertook the impossible task of designing and building of an automobile from scratch only in 130 days.Director Ornek and his well-picked cast takes us through the 4-month period of hard-work that produced the ""Devrim"" (Revolution) to a backdrop of Turkish political situation that followed the military coup. Both the screenplay and direction are praiseworthy, and Tolga Ornek deserves much of the credit for keeping it simple, subtle and fascinating.Unlike most other contemporary Turkish movies full of popular names and pretty faces, all the actors are ""actors"", each with well-deserved respectability and genuine talent. Everyone does a good job in making their characters real and fascinating enough. See it.",1
10,"Dear publicity agency, if i were you, i would spend every peny that i had to promote this movie, because i would know that it worthed. those faces i will never forget, faces of sadness, humble happiness, desperation... very human, very deep. lights and colour balances are also great. the story itself is a masterpiece, i believe. more than enough, more than good... great movie. bravo...",1
9,I was surprised I haven't watched this movie until now. Actors are famous and also acting great in this movie.Movie shows how Turkish are desperate about producing heavy industrial products. Noone thinks in that economic conditions they could produce a car. But one man in a coup time orders to produce a car just to give people this belief. Then we see how engineers work very hard to do their job from zero until final point. Acting is very good in those moments.Movie is very inspirational about that. Everyone should believe and work hard for their dreams instead staying desperate.,1
1,"Come on, this movie is way too overrated! OK, it is shot well, acting is OK( although it is overacted at times), the plot moves along smoothly. Overall, it feels a lot like a very long advertisement, promoting Turkish automobile industry which would not disturb those viewers who are particularly interested in cars, for instance, or advertisements. After the actor ends his long speech with a climactic voice, what is lacking is not more than a sound at the background uttering the name of the brand. Even this wouldn't be too disturbing had the movie not condoned the 1960 coup d'etat. The cars in question are ordered by Cemal pasha so he overcomes his inferiority complex that Turks cannot even make a needle. The car is branded Revolution, just as the coup was euphemistically called in those days (and even today), but not appreciated by the general public, who simply do not understand what is bestowed upon them.The best engineers of the country come together to finish the business while we are supposed to be thrilled as we watch the countdown to the deadline for the production of the car. The message delivered in the movie is simply too disturbing for anyone in their right mind: don't criticize and don't argue - just obey the orders and make sacrifices to achieve the goals set by the Leader. Even a smile from the Leader provokes waves of happiness, while letting him down would amount to betraying the country. To summarize: the artistic value of the move is low (very much like a TV soap opera), and the political message is repulsive. If you want a good Turkish movie, do yourself a favor and watch Uc Maymun by Nur Bilge Ceyhan or Bes valid by Reha Erdem. Don't waste your time with this one as I unfortunately did.",-1
8,"This movie is a docudrama of a dramatic success story. I felt nothing exaggerated beyond the reality, the focus to the personal lives and details of the individuals are also very natural despite they have not from a documented source.People who expect dramatic reality probably will like this movie. On the other hand, people those who are expecting momentary fiction, action etc. may not get satisfied with this movie. This is because the only abnormal thing in the movie is the design and prototype production of the car in within a too short time and bad conditions. All act are very successful reflection from real lives.You may like it as any other good movie if you watch it without any bias or comparing to fictional films. In my opinion it is worth watching.",1
8,"Rugged private eye Jimmy Dillinger (well played to the tough guy hilt by Wade Nichols) finds himself embroiled in a seedy and dangerous world of drugs, murder, prostitution, gangsters and white slavery when he searches the sordid New York City punk rock scene for missing teenage runaway Jenny Jordan (fetching brunette Susaye London). Director/co-writer Carter Stevens offers a pleasingly sleazy wallow in the extremely coarse'n'nasty neon slime: we've got excessive profane dialogue, a few attractive ladies deliver a nice smattering of tasty female nudity, a smidgen of raunchy sex, a constant snappy pace, hard-boiled narration, a remarkably tricky and complex plot, authentically grimy urban cesspool locations, a grotty tone, a heated shoot-out, and a genuinely startling surprise downbeat ending that packs a potent punch right to the gut. Moreover, there's a nifty rogues' gallery of colorful low-life characters: Richard Bolla as huffy, cynical cop Detective Joe Giovanni, Bobby Astyr as twitchy, wormy hoodlum Igor, Elda Gentile as brash pimp punkette Vanessa Garbo, Crystal Sync as sweet'n'saucy hooker Jana, Jean Sanders as zonked-out junkie dancer Nan, and Randy Coppasquatto as Vanessa's slimy henchman Ralphie. Best of all, there's a mighty vivid and flavorsome evocation of the grubby 70's Big Apple underground punk milieu, complete with first-rate raw and energetic live stage performances by the punk bands the Fast, the Squirrels, Spicy Bits, and Elda and the Stillettos. Prudence Prevails' gritty cinematography does the trick. The funky pulsating score likewise hits the groovy spot. A lot of deliciously down'n'dirty fun.",1
5,"The Late Wade Nichols stars as a Police Detective looking for a rich man's daughter who is missing.  R. Bolla plays his grumpy Captain who hate Wade's guts.  Bolla who is an adult film actor has no sex scenes, as if he was ready to go mainstream (he did several horror films since).  The ending was poor as Wade dies, and the sound is bad.  The video version has video insert tacked in on the sex scenes to make the scene longer.  Wade, in my opinion is one of the best adult film actors (next to Sonny Landham) to make a transition to mainstream films, it's too bad about his death.  Adult films in the 70's had good plot to keep the audience watching, but plotlines died in the late 80's.",-1
5,"ZORRO is a familiar Italian action-adventure movie, a swashbuckling version of the popular character that owes plenty to the success of THE THREE MUSKETEERS at the beginning of the 1970s. Alain Delon gives a routine performance as the titular character, a quiet, classy regional governor by day, a masked hero by night. The film is ably directed under the sure hand of Duccio Tessari but suffers from a bloated running time and a play-it-safe feel that goes through the motions without ever really burning up the screen. The most interesting part of it lies in the casting of Stanley Baker as the chief villain of the hour; this was his last role for cinema and he's as imposing as you'd expect. Elsewhere, expect broad laughs, exaggerated characters, and energetic if slapdash fight scenes.",-1
6,"I was introduced to Zorro by the Guy Williams version which were regularly repeated when I was a kid. Those Disney Zorro's will always have a special place for me.Alain Delon starred in a curious Italian version filmed in Spain and set in South America.Delon is Don Diego. When his friend Miguel is killed in the eve of his departure to the New World, Diego takes his place as the new governor who has arrived from Spain in order to avenge his friend's death.Diego plays the Governor as prissy and fey in order not to be seen as a threat. He finds the people are oppressed by the cruel and corrupt Colonel Huerta (Stanley Baker) who has plans to become the new Governor and was involved in the death of MiguelInspired by the tales of the masked black fox by street kids he dons the mask of Zorro and fights for justice which enrages the Colonel and his militia.Alain Delon enjoys playing the dual roles as foppish Diego and the devilish and dashing Zorro. He is matched in one of his last film roles by Stanley Baker as the mean villain but an expert swordsman which leads to a terrific and thrilling final duel between the two.Minor characters provide humour such as the mute sidekick and Seargent Garcia.The film does come across like a curious and campy B film with a diverse cast. The French actor Delon as the Main hero, Welsh actor Baker as the villain and the rest of the cast seem to be mainly Italian.However the action scenes are well choreographed and it does feel like a Zorro movie and it is very unpretentious.",1
8,"Just having Alain Delon in that title role ... I mean that is quite a thing. And than the title music too. Of course that can work against the movie too. I know some were appalled or at least annoyed by the music ... so it'll depend on how you see things I reckon.The movie is also full of slapstick. Zorro is a great sword fighter, but he's not out to really kill. So this may not be the best Zorro incarnation, but it is quite a decent one to say the least. And I attribute most of this to the lead role. The bad guy is nicely played too, but without Delon and his charme and on screen presence ... the movie would not be worth half of it I think ... ridiculous barrel scene and all that. But as I said above, you have to be in the right mood for certain things too ...",1

Zorro unites forces to Father Francisco (Albertini) and a beautiful aristocrat (Ottavia Piccolo). Zorro-Delon fight evildoers and greedy colonel oppressor, while saving damsel in distress from a fate worse than death . The film is set in salty flavour of Old South American , New Aragon , rather than Old California , though it was filmed in Spain.Derring-do , feats , adventures , humor and action find this agreeable swashbuckler . Alain Delon runs and jumps , bounds and leaps all over the images and overacting outrageously when plays the queer governor . Delon requested to make this film after enjoying his role in the swashbuckler The Black Tulip (1964) by Christian Jaque . A nice cast keeps the picture moving at a rapid clip, special mention for Giacomo Rossi Stuart as grumpy German lieutenant Von Merkel and Moustache as bungler sergeant Garcia . The exciting final sword duel was inspired by the 1952 swashbuckler Scaramouche by George Sidney . Most of the crew was from Italy and the filming took place in Spain , though studio work was done in Rome , Italy . The motion picture was well-mounted and fast paced by Duccio Tessari , a Spaghetti Western expert.Other versions about this known personage , as television series starred by Guy Williams during the 60s and the 90s starred by Duncan Regher , as cinema the classic silent version (1920) by Douglas Fairbanks and 'The mark of Zorro' (1940) starred by Tyrone Power and directed by Robert Mamoulian .

7,"RELEASED IN 1975 and directed by Duccio Tessari, ""Zorro"" stars Alain Delon as a new Spanish governor in Mexican California in the 1820s. With the populace of Nueva Aragón under the oppressive rule of corrupt Colonel Huerta (Stanley Baker), the foppish governor becomes the masked adventurer, Zorro, to bring justice. Ottavia Piccolo plays the noble hottie; Enzo Cerusico Zorro's mute servant; and Moustache a bumbling fat bastage soldier.The version I viewed cut out an entire half hour, so I might raise my rating if I eventually see the longer version. Nevertheless, there's enough good in the short version to make this colorful European rendition of Zorro worth catching if you like swashbuckling adventure flicks with joie de vivre (""joy of living""), like ""The Musketeer"" (2001), ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981) and, of course, ""The Mask of Zorro"" (1998). I'm familiar with protagonist Delon from a couple of his prior films, ""Texas Across the River"" (1966) and ""Red Sun"" (1971), where he struck me as a striking, charismatic actor; unfortunately, he's not well known in the USA. Regardless, he's just perfect for the role of Zorro. Meanwhile, Piccolo is mind-blowing as the honorable senorita. The closing elongated sword fight is possibly the best bout of fencing put to celluloid, next to the one at the end of ""Rob Roy"" (1995). THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours (with a widely circulated 87 minute version) and was shot in Almería & Madrid, Spain. WRITERS: Giorgio Arlorio (story) and Giorgio Arlorio (screenplay). GRADE: B",1
8,This is not a film that most people would like much less love. It has a cult following that gets the humor of Zorro and spaghetti westerns. It's actually quite funny but it is not what you would call an outstanding film but it does entertain fans.The movie feels like a typical spaghetti western but with comedy - I would say similar to the Trinity films (See: They Call Me Trinity) while it maintains its comic book characteristics.If you like 'Zorro: The Gay Blade (1981)' or 'The Legend of Zorro (2005)' then is possible that you might like 'Zorro (1975)'.8/10,1
7,"Within the frame of the eminently savory European swashbucklers, Delon's Zorro is more kindred to Sandokan or to the B. Spencer buccaneers flick The Black Pirate than to the French Fanfan, Cartouche, etc.. It doesn't so much come from the French swashbucklers made by Philippe, Marais, Belmondo, Gérard Barray,etc.,but it certainly plays as a worthy contemporary of the Sandokan movies.""Zorro"" is first of all a comedy and an adventure movie. The camp note is intended. They did not want a straight swashbuckler, but a comedy. Stupid, but likable in an unpretentious way. None of these funny and moderately thrilling films is very intelligent; Sandokan isn't, the rest of them aren't. It's goofy but yummy because it has a certain warmth and brio and flair; this is called craftsmanship. It is noticeable that if the Americans had I. Allen, the Europeans had, in the '60s and '70s, many such craftsmen. Delon has all the glamor required by the role and does a highly likable physical part. The rest of the cast is as incompetent as it gets, but Delon was man enough to keep the adventure moving. For me the cinema genres reached their best in these European films of the '60s and '70sand in all the domainsswashbucklers, adventure, SciFi, horror, erotica, thriller, crime, western, etc.. Even the slapdash was amusing and funny; ""Zorro"" is rather slapdash, yet it has this hugely enjoyable Italian gusto, the fine score, the sense of the comedy. In fact, the Delon ""Zorro"" is a comedy, a comical swashbuckler. It was very lucky that they have got Delon for the main part. Delon's Zorro is usually passed under silence when Delon's roles are discussedas if it was something shameful. On the contrary, I find his performance here to be very Such a cinema will not be very much enjoyed by those who don't like exaggerationsa certain type of exaggerationsthe purposeful onesthe same class of man, I believe, who don't like, for the same reasonthe exaggerationsalbeit meaningful onesthe Turkish poetry and music. In ""Zorro"" everything is goofy and exaggeratedyet everything is yummy ,and few things are phony. Delon was given, as Zorro, little room for his wellknown narcissism, so he obeyed the spirit of the film and gave a joyful and comical performance, almost uncharacteristic of him, and immensely adding to the movie's sense of joy.",1
7,"I saw this version on television in the 70's. It was fantastic then and still holds up well now. Sure, it has a few slow moments, but Alain Delon and Stanley Baker appear to be having so much fun that you forgive the slow parts. I read somewhere that Delon did this movie as a present for his son, who was a huge Zorro fan. Well, it was a fine present for all of us.The story is a bit different than the American versions, which works in its favor. The fights are well staged, with great comedic moments. Delon cuts a dashing figure as Zorro and carries the right tone. He brawls and slashes with soldiers in the finest of swashbuckling traditions.Stanley Baker is properly evil and totally understands his role. His eyes illuminate plots and schemes.The final duel is one of the best, on par with the Power version and the duel in Scaramouche. Swords clash all over stairs, furniture, balconies, beams, and rooftops, until the villain is slain.This one is definitely a keeper.",1
10,"Alaiv Delon is on of the most famous actors in the world. Modern folks do not know the name, but cinefiles do. This movie is a good mix of comedy, action, a little romance, and a delight to watch.I think his portrayal of Zorro and Don Diego were the inspirations behind Chris Reeve Superman. He plays a bumbling fool and a heroic man in one movie.His presence in both roles are commanding. You know who the star is. The bad guys Col. Huerta is also well played, and is played by Stanley Baker.Essentially Don Diego s' cousin is murdered, and Don Diego takes his place to bring peace, but he brings it his justice, as he dons the Mask.Excellent movie. And recommended from. Fans of REAL hero movies, this is a must. It moves very fast, the music is one of the best out there. IT is never boring as the scenes are well paced and meaningful and the music is placed and scored amazingly.Highly recommended, 9.5 out of 10 from me.",1
5,"Zees movie is....zuper. Ok. I think just the monologuing gets overly with the characters saying stuff ''for the people'' while ...a crowd of people surround, also that song is kinda cheesy, however great scope, great Delon, an ezact Zorofski, zayonara, zeehee. ZzzzI like that his dual identity in here is unlike other movies for a change where he is a regular guy(poet? count?) in here he's Governor. Although I also like the other Z. As the dual identity he is just whimsically funny. My favorite Zorro is the crossovers with 3 Musketeers/Maciste from '63 but this '75 is great. Z me.The greatest thing of all is he at the end is going off into the sunset himself free.",-1
8,"An old-fashioned treasure of a mix of western and a comedy with heavy social commentary. Demonstrates the absurdity of the ruling class. Celebrates people coming together and rising up against their wealthy oppressors. It does all this while maintaining a child-like sense of humor which feels fun for the whole family while importing lessons about social justice and a fair market economy. Some of its humor may seem silly by today's standards. And yes, some of the stereotyping that occurs may seem dated to today's standards. But the overall spirit of the film will win you over if you just surrender to its call for justice :)",1
10,"A film´s quality cannot be reduced in its main title track...I even may agree that the song ""Zorro is back"" is not the best composition made by the Italian brothers Guido & Maurizio De Angelis, but the rest of the film score is very good.Alain Delon performance is just great along with the other actors. The plot, the script, the photography, the direction and everything is just fine.For what I´ve read in different places, it seems as European films go really bad when they´re dubbed in English... gee that´s bad luck!. But that has nothing to do with the film... I can´t complain about the Spanish version of ""El Zorro"". It´s fine.This is a very amusing, non-stop action film, so take my advice and don´t miss it... you´ll have a wonderful time... because...ZORRO IS BACK!!(10 out of 10)",1
1,"This is an insult to the Zorro legend, it is just awful, the filming is overexposed, the acting by some of the cast is way over the top, Alain Delon for most of the time walks about with a few days growth of beard, and poor Stanley Baker, not a good film to nearly end his career on, and l don't think the director Duccio Tessari knew what he was doing, and that awful awful music every time Zorro appears, if you ever have to see this film you will know what l mean, to many deep closeups, and added sound effects of swords clashing together spoilt this films, well for me it did I don't like giving a film a low mark, but as Zorro is my favourite film character this is a disgrace so 1 out of 10",-1

9,"I have always been a fan of Zorro, especially the Guy Williams interpretation. Naturally I had to check this film out.The first time I watched it, I wasn't really impressed. Not that it was bad, but I was expecting more than what I got, especially with the theme music. However, after a few more viewings, I fell in love with it.A lot of it had to do with viewing more George Hilton and Sergio Corbucci spaghetti westerns and a lot of it had to with acquired taste I sadly admit.However, with each viewing I love this film more and more. Duccio Tessari does a wonderful job mimicking the camera work Sergio Leone and Corbucci without copying any of them and Moustache is superbly hilarious as Sgt. Gonzalez. Alaine Delon masters the duel identities wonderfully. And now I love the theme music.Please note though that this is an extremely budget spaghetti western. If you're expecting the Good the Bad and the Ugly you'll be disappointed.",1
8,"Tongue in cheek romp, clever action shots, slap stick comic relief, silly theme song, great scenery and lavish costumes, what more can one ask from a $1 DVD?I found this DVD in the dollar bin at Big Lots along with several others. The rest were not saving, but Zoro is a keeper. The interplay between Zoro (Alain Delon) and Col. Huerta (Stanley Baker) is excellent. They spar verbally in the first half of the film, which climaxes in a long sword fight between the two. Incidentally, Stanley Baker died the year after completing Zorro, at age 49.Ottavia Piccolo plays the female role to perfection.",1
7,"Yes, the 'Hollywood DVD Classics' from Double-D print of _Zorro_ is overexposed and awful, but I didn't expect much to begin with. In fact, the DVD quality was so bad that I used it to test DVD drives and video software. However smoothly it ran gave an excellent indication of how well the buffering in a system I played it on was! Anyway, you can't go wrong if you think of this as just a rainy day DVD. The movie has nearly continuous and lavish action sequences, the acting is good, and it was worth every penny. The 'Zorro's Back' song by Oliver Onions is scarily contagious. There is also a good amount of humor more generally, but sometimes you will be laughing 'at it' as much as 'with it'.",1

There is love and romance he falls in love with his friend's niece. She could be placing herself in danger by speaking against the cruelty's of the Colonial who really controls this city. It is fun to see the children help Zorro when he is in need. The best line is ""He took the Hook Line and Sinker."" The singing will go on and go on Zorro is Back!

6,"With the Time Masters after the crew of the Wave Rider, the crew found a home in 19th century western United States and turned out a slightly more entertaining episode than in the weeks past.Taking a science fiction television show/film into the west is a difficult task as the only real time I remember it being successful is with Firefly. So I had little to no confidence that this episode would do anything to further my interest in the show. Although it did have its entertaining moments, it once again suffered from the overly filler feel to the story. Why is it that Vandal Savage has only been in around 5 episodes? It's blatantly obvious that the writers were forced into writing 16 episodes for CW when the show was much better off on a 8- 10 episode run.With that said, I enjoyed the presence of Johnathon Schaech as Jonah Hex. He doesn't get a ton to do, but he brought a different dynamic to a show that needed something to keep my interest. If they decide to shift the cast around next year, I would welcome Hex into the equation. As convenient as it was that they ended up in the same town as Hex, it was even more improbable that they ended up curing HG Wells of tuberculosis. First Bill Gates and now HG Wells? Perhaps the show is trying to be a little too clever.Speaking of which, I'm really over any of the characters trying to fix something that may affect the future. Hasn't Stein been watching the implications each of his crew mates has made when they try stunts like that? I just don't like to see rehashed story lines.Kendra and Sara went on their mini trip as the former apparently ran into her former self coincidentally. Yep, yet another 'random run in' for the crew. Anyways, this episode did little to further the plot at all or my interest, but it had its moments, and it was at least watchable television.+Jonah Hex+Different setting helped give some life to the show-Rehashed arcs-A little too many coincidences6.7/10",1

It made the episode purposeful and very focused. Each of the three parts of the episode were equally important for the growth of the characters and progression of the story. It made me wanting more straight away. A very well crafted, as always well acted and well scripted episode.",1

4,"Spring Byington is a small town justice of the Peace who believes in the goodness of all people, except for county political boss Emory Parnell. Parnell has just put in a bid to buy the local orphanage using John Agar as a front. Agar is in love with Miss Byington's daughter, Anne Francis, and pretending to be parolee Stanley Clements. Fortunately, George Winslow, whom Miss Byington is adopting, has a ray gun which makes everyone tell the truth.Carried on the capable shoulders of Misses Byington, Francis and Charles Coburn, this movie, co-written by Lenny Bruce, leaves me a bit groggy as to what is going on, except for the rather nonce romance between Agar and Miss Francis. A bit of reading bout the movie turned up the word 'wacky' a lot, and yes, that is a word that describes this. If, that is, one wishes to be charitable. Perhaps it would be wisest to leave it at that.",-1
4,"O.K., it is obvious that this was targeted for a 1954 Kiddy audience, the kind that would be shown at an early matinée along with films like Abbott and Costello's ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" and ""The Three Stooges in Outer Space"". But 60 years later, this seems like ""Capra for Dummies"". George ""Foghorn"" Winslow is amusing in small doses, such as his supporting bit in ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"" where he came on to be cute, did his bit, and was off so Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell could go back to tantalizing the men in the audience and the women could ""ooh"" and ""ah!"" over their wardrobe. But he pretty much runs the show here as an orphan who somehow ends up with a special ray gun that gets adults to do the right thing either by slamming on the breaks as a cop is about to bust them for drunk driving or later tell the truth.Young Winslow's inability to hold down an entire movie is obvious as soon as he provides ""narration"". It's easy to see why the widowed Spring Byington would want to adopt him, and had the adults been more involved in the story than this one-trick child actor, the film might have more appeal today. Still, to get to see a kid take on a ruthless politician (Emory Parnell) since adults obviously can't do it themselves is a neat little plot twist, and in spite of Winslow's over-exposure, you can't help but cheer him on.Reunited after 1950's ""Louisa"", Charles Coburn and Byington are a cute ""mature"" couple, and its also nice to see Coburn interacting with Winslow after being told by him to ""stop that!"" while holding his hand in ""GPB"". John Agar and Anne Francis offer young love for the adults who did go to see this picture, with Agar playing a man on Parnell's payroll to figure out a way to discredit Byington. This all culminates in a town meeting where the predictable occurs, obvious motives are revealed, and a cute little finale wraps everything up. A young Beverly Garland has a small role as the bride at a wedding justice of the peace Byington performs. It's all quite harmless and sweet, but one can't help but have hoped for something a bit more juicy to have made this more palatable for adults.",-1

6,"This story is sort of like the parable of the Protigal Son with LOTS of changes--mainly, the son is a total idiot and the father actually is the one who is the judgmental jerk. It begins with a couple of college chums. One is rich and nice (in other words, a total patsy) and the other is poor and went to school on a scholarship. When the poor one does something stupid, the rich friend takes responsibility (why, we must only assume because he's an imbecile). When he's then thrown out of school, his father disowns him. Here is where it's more like the Protigal Son, as the young moron spends his new inheritance on drunken living among rich low-lifes and he proceeds to throw his life away--though, once again, we are unsure why. After all, with this inheritance he should have a lovely life even after having been thrown out of school (30000 Pounds was a HUGE sum of money in 1927). In the end, the young guy is a total physical and mental wreck when he somehow manages to struggle home.Even by the standards of the silent era, ""Downhill"" (also known as ""When Boys Leave Home"") is an incredibly old fashioned and overly moralistic sort of film--the sort you would never associate with Alfred Hitchcock. However, at this point in his career, there was no 'Hitchcock style' and he made a wide range of films--not just suspense and murder films. However, the story itself is so totally lacking that it really didn't give this fine director much with which to work. However, in his defense, at least he did an exceptional job when it came to the cinematography and the film had a wonderful artistry about it that sets it apart. In fact, it's so lovely that I still mildly recommend the film--even with the rather dumb plot.",1
5,"As a huge Hitchcock fan, Downhill was an interesting film but while not among his weakest it is a long way from being among his best. The acting is not bad at all, in fact decent(likewise with the chemistry between them), Ivor Novello's performance is expressive and moving if not always subtle, Isabel Jeans is a sympathetic Julia and Annette Benson makes Mabel's scheming believable. Ian Hunter is also very naturalistic in his role. The production values and Hitchcock's direction are Downhill's best qualities, both are superb. The film is really beautifully shot, some of the best and most ahead-of-its-time photography of any of Hitchcock's silent films. The choice of locations are appropriate and well-utilised, particularly with the scenes set in the nightclub and theatre. The hand-held camera shots signifying Roddy's delirium, the slow pan shot during the dance in the Parisian hall scene and the long pulling-back shot with us thinking that Roddy is dressing for a fancy night, then us thinking that he is waiter and then we realise that he is on the stage stand out as being especially good technically. Hitchcock wasn't yet in his comfort zone, but his direction not only shows technical skill but also early in his career being able to show the psychological insight that he was often so good at. As well as enhancing the mood. From a narrative standpoint unfortunately Downhill falls far short in comparison, for all how strong his visuals and direction are Hitchcock apparently had little interest in the story and it comes through loud and clear. The story creaks that wooden floorboards in a deserted house, makes very little sense and does drag quite badly at times. The characters are not very interesting and often one-sided which, especially with the female characters, may leave a sour taste in the mouth. The script touches on the social hypocrisy and the separation of classes- morally mostly- but to me it does very little with those themes and while interesting for when and where Downhill was set it doesn't hold up well today. On the whole, a mixed view here, loved it technically, didn't care for it narratively. 5/10 Bethany Cox",-1

She claims to be compromised by the poorer kid which would eliminate him from staying in school and realizing a dream. So the rich kid takes the rap and ends up an outcast, getting into more and more trouble not of his own making. I don't know that the other guy deserved this but Ivor Novello's character pays an extraordinary price. He becomes an outcast to his father and family and friends. Of course, there is a twist because good triumphs. But I'm not so sure it really does because of all the villainy and victims that fill the screen. Still, it's early Hitchcock and few people really know about it.",1
8,"Producer: Michael Balcon. A Gainsborough Production. U.S. release through Sono Art-World Wide (cut to 74 minutes). No recorded New York opening. U.K. release through Wardour Films. 80 minutes U.S. release title: WHEN BOYS LEAVE HOME.SYNOPSIS: Slatternly shop-girl alleges one of two college boys sexually assaulted her, when in actual fact she encouraged both of them.NOTES: The American version was considerably censored. The allegation of sexual assault was changed to theft (which makes no sense whatever. The reaction of the players and the vicious tirade launched by Miss Benson clearly indicate that a far more serious charge was involved).COMMENT: Although it meanders to a foregone yet disappointing conclusion, this is a most engrossing movie for three-quarters of its length. The opening scenes with that delightfully vicious floosie, Annette Benson, and the clerically coddled Robert Irvine, plus the middle episode in which our hero encounters spendthrift musical comedy star, Isabel Jeans, and her faithful yet otherwise comically rotten-to-the-core lover, Ian Hunter, come over as especially striking, despite the fact that Novello is obviously far too old for a college boy and his acting (particularly in comparison with the other players) overwrought. These scenes are also full of delightful Hitchcock touches, including a bit when our hero surreptitiously pockets the heroine's purse (which it turns out is a joke on the audience), rides a lonely Down escalator to the Underground, and gets drenched on top of a double-decker bus. Mr. Hunter does extremely well in a most difficult role. His Archie is a comic character, yet he's an object of derision (except oddly from Miss Jeans) and from an audience point-of-view, totally unsympathetic. Under Hitch's inspired direction, Hunter manages to juggle hisses and comic capers with amazing dexterity. Easily the best performance of his entire career!",1

6,"Silent film directed by Alfred Hitchcock about a wealthy young man named Roddy (Ivor Novello) who takes the blame for a friend's indiscretions with a tramp and finds his whole life unraveling because of it. Not entirely successful, with a yawner of an ending, but worth a look for Novello's performance and glimpses of Hitchcock's emerging style. Tenth-billed Ian Hunter plays a small role as an actor who helps rip Roddy off. The whole thing is filmed in sepia tone except for a section in green, the reason behind which is actually fairly clever. Watch and I'm sure you'll figure it out. It's a decent picture but it goes on too long. Lost my interest well before the disappointing ending. Still, give it a go and form your own opinion. Even a lesser Hitchcock film is worth seeing.",1
8,"During my youth in the sixties and seventies silent films were quite regularly shown on British television, but today are they are few and far between even on specialist movie channels, and are hardly ever shown on terrestrial television, perhaps because the generation that can remember the silent era are mostly dead. Many people therefore do not realise that Alfred Hitchcock made a number of silent films during the twenties; they are much less well-known than his Hollywood films of the forties, fifties and sixties, and even than the British talkies like ""The Lady Vanishes"" which he made in the thirties. ""Downhill"", recently shown on Sky Classics, is one of them, dating from 1927, towards the end of the silent era. (It was released in the same year as the first talking picture, ""The Jazz Singer""). As the film opens its hero, Roddy Berwick, appears to be a fortunate young man. The son of an aristocratic family, he is School Captain at an exclusive public school. He is popular, intelligent and the school's star rugby player. His world collapses when Mabel, a waitress at a local café, announces to the headmaster that she is pregnant and that Roddy is the father. The real culprit, in fact, is Roddy's best friend Tim, but Mabel appears to have singled Roddy out because his family is wealthier than Tim's and she is hoping that she can blackmail them. Out of loyalty to his friend, however, Roddy accepts the blame and expulsion from the school. This is not the end of his misfortunes, however. He is disowned by his father, who believes him guilty of the accusation. He goes to work as an actor and marries a famous actress named Julia, but the marriage is an unhappy one and she leaves him for another man. He inherits £30,000 from a relation, but loses it all, largely due to Julia's extravagance. He becomes a gigolo in Paris, but quits this line of work in disgust and ends up penniless and starving. The theme of Mabel's pregnancy is treated very obscurely, so much so that some have misinterpreted these scenes and incorrectly concluded that Roddy is expelled on a false accusation of theft. This is because the British censors discouraged any discussion of sexual matters. Although the American Hays Office was not set up until the 1930s, its British equivalent, the British Board of Film Censors, had been established in 1912, with the result that film censorship in Britain during the twenties tended to be stricter than in America (and, indeed, than in many European countries). In later years Hitchcock was to become famous for his suspense thrillers; nearly all his Hollywood films, with ""Mr and Mrs Smith"" a rare exception, fall into this category. In his early British period, however, he made numerous films in other genres as well, and ""Downhill"" is a melodrama rather than a thriller. It does, however, show evidence of some of the techniques that were later to make him famous, particularly in films like ""Spellbound"" in which he could indulge his love of the surreal and dreamlike. In one scene Roddy, taken ill while on a ship, experiences a delirious nightmare. Hitchcock also makes use of shots of a descending escalator, not for any literal meaning but as a visual metaphor for Roddy's descent into misfortune, which is of course the significance of the title ""Downhill"". (It is strange how English and many other languages use the expression ""going downhill"" as a metaphor for a change in one's fortunes for the worse, even though in reality the lowlands at the foot of a hill are often a more pleasant place to be than the hilltop itself). True colour films were very rare in the twenties, but ""Downhill"", in common with a number of other monochrome films from the period makes use of the device of film tinting, in which different scenes are tinted in different shades. Orange is normally used for interior scenes and daytime exteriors, blue for nighttime exteriors and green for scenes set at sea and the nightmare sequences. Only a few scenes are in straightforward black-and-white. Even in my youth, most of the silent movies shown on TV were comedies. Indeed, at the time I formed the quite erroneous impression that during the silent era nobody ever made films about serious subjects and that my grandparents' generation only ever went to the cinema to laugh at the antics of Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton or Laurel and Hardy. The sort of slapstick at which these comedians excelled has passed the test of time better than the serious films of the era which can look very alien today, largely because they required non-naturalistic acting techniques with which we are unfamiliar. Dialogue had to be supplied by title cards, and in ""Downhill"" Hitchcock keeps his use of these to a minimum. Emotion had to be conveyed through facial expression and gesture alone, something which must have appeared strange to British people in the twenties who generally believed in keeping a stiff upper lip and regarded gesticulating while talking as a foreign eccentricity. ""Downhill"", however, shows just how powerful silent film could be as a story-telling medium. The film's happy ending may seem sentimental today, but at the time ""vice punished and virtue rewarded"" was an established dramatic convention, and Roddy's misfortunes are due not to his vices but to an excess of virtue, which enables the cowardly Tim and the manipulative Julia to take advantage of his good nature. Once one gets used to the melodramatic acting techniques, one can appreciate the power of some of the performances here, especially from Ivor Novello (today better remembered as a musician and composer than as an actor) as Roddy, Annette Benson as the scheming Mabel and Isabel Jeans as Julia. The film makes compelling viewing for anyone with an interest in Hitchcock's work. 8/10",1
7,"""Downhill"" is the fourth early Hitchcock movie I discovered after ""Waltzes from Vienna"", ""Juno and the Paycock"" and ""Mary"" (I discount the original ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" as the film started Hitch' canon), so the more restored gems I discover, the more I understood how Hitchcock became one of the most prolific directors ever.I could have said 'one of the greatest', but 'great' is a misleading word, Orson Welles was one of the greatest too, but his first strike was also his masterpiece, Tarantino also started with his best movies but it's not just about hitting a home run in your first game, but about keeping the distance after that. Hitchcock was a late bloomer, he only made a name for himself in his forties and became the world' most iconic filmmaker in his fifties. It took a long time, but this is what allowed him to make a lot of films, just like John Ford, some were good, a few of them were great, but most of them were forgettable, if not forgotten. Still, within their own debatable quality, these movies he made as a contract-director allowed him to sharpen his tools and make his bones, the slow and hard way.In ""Waltzes from Vienna"", Hitch' experimented the use of music in order to make it in line with the action, a device that would be useful in ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"". In ""Mary"", it was the use of point-of-view shooting, every little movie he made planted the seeds of his emerging talent but ""Downhill"", Hitchcock's silent movie, released in 1927, was a totally different experience. While I expected the work of a rising director still learning the tricks, I discovered an ambitious, absorbing and compelling psychological drama, working like the ancestor of ""Requiem for a Dream"", even with the same straightforward title. And the storytelling was like the hurly-burly of life grabbing your heart and taking you in the path of the main protagonist played by Ivor Novello, i.e downhill.The movie chronicles the descent into poverty and madness of Roddy, a handsome young preppy promised to a brilliant future, Captain of his school rugby team, coming from a rich family, eye-pleasing and maybe his worst quality: goodhearted. After flirting with a waitress and dating her with his friend Tim, he learns several days later from the headmaster that the girl is pregnant. The film clearly indicates that Roddy's innocent, if there ever is one culprit because nothing actually proves she's pregnant, but, her target is Roddy because she knows he's the wealthy one. And since Tim needs his father's money for a scholarship, to get to Oxford, Roddy sacrifices his career and causes himself to be expelled. Back home, his father won't believe his innocence (why should he? Who can be fool enough to jeopardize his life for an act he didn't commit?) causing his son to slam the door.There is a very defining moment in ""Downhill"" when a sad-eyed Roddy takes the subway's escalator and slowly vanishes from the screen. It is not the most subtle symbolism but it is very poignant and powerful within the plot's narrative as Roddy's journey can be compared to a slow downfall. Roddy starts as a stage actor and gets involved in a relationship that would empty his pockets because of a venal actress who won't improve his trust on people of female persuasion and he finally turns into a gigolo in a sordid French nightclub where we can see, while an old lady is having a heart-to-heart talk with him, that the man is drowning in his own self-loathing bitterness, constantly wondering how he ended up in such a situation.Besides Hitchcock's directing, Ivor Novello's performance is integral to the film's strength, of course it carries the mark of the silent era, and I concede that many close-ups or side-eyes from the characters were a bit distracting, but when I saw the film, I had to interrupt it and check the name of the actor, I realized Novello was 34 during the film, which was surprising because he really looked sweet and innocent in the beginning as the idealistic smiling preppy, I really thought he was in his twenties. Yet near the end, when the delirium phrase begun, you could almost give him the age of 40, and it's definitely not the make-up, the face of this poor man is like a sponge that absorbed so much hardship that you could only feel the pain in his eyes. And the talent of Hitchcock is to completely rely on the face of the actor to convey the tragedy of his life and use the minimum of card-boards to make his point.And the least card-boards there were, the more efficient they were, and I felt like it was Hitchcock putting himself in his so cherished Gold-like position, with an obvious sympathy toward Roddy, because the ugly words were never directed at him but at the steps of his hellish journey, calling 'stage' the world of 'make-believes' or nightclubs 'the world of lost illusions'. The film is interesting because it give us a hint on how Hitchcock, the man whose touch could always be read in his movies, could make his presence visible in the silent era, when he hadn't much trademarks to show off. And the result is simply astonishing and carries all the promises of Hitch's talent.A few words about the ending, I expect many viewers will be surprised by the 'happy' ending, thinking that realistically, the man should have ended up in a worse situation, but think about it, had it happened today, with the Internet and all the modern devices, he certainly wouldn't have went through the same troubles and been easier to find. The 20's were indeed a time where you could go downhill quicker than you'd think, and it's very revealing that the film's other title is ""When Boys Leave Home"".",1
7,"Hitchcock expressed one of his favorite themes in this silent film made when he was just 28, that of the wrongly accused man. In a Kafkaesque nightmare, an affluent college kid with everything going for him is accused of getting a waitress pregnant when it was really his friend, and without any form of due process from the headmaster, is expelled. Things continue to go downhill when his father doesn't believe he's innocent and calls him a liar to his face, prompting him to leave home.There is some real darkness here, and one of the highlights of the film is in how we see this through the man's eyes. Those who judge him stare sternly at him, those he meets who take advantage of him (including an actress he marries) mock him mirthfully, and those he meets in run-down places stare at him with pathos in their eyes. Hitchcock really pulls emotion out of these scenes, without of course the benefit of audio. He also includes flashbacks, a nightmare, and a delirium scene as the man begins falling apart, and I loved the camerawork throughout the film - both the stationary wide shots which showed fantastic framing, and those trying to convey the man's state of mind.On the downside, the film suffers a little from slow pace, at least by today's standards. It's also not especially kind to women, with the man ruined in stages by the waitress who plays around, his wife who kept the lover she had before getting married, and by a woman who takes a cut from the money he gets dancing (and possibly sleeping with) older women. It plays with tired old themes of evil women bringing a virtuous man down. I have to say, the ending felt a bit off as well, and inconsistent with the tone of everything that came before it.With that said, each part of this story was executed well, and could stand alone as chapters in a book or acts in a play. I liked how Hitchcock played with the sexual elements of the story as well. The waitress kisses the man's friend, invites him back after hours by coyly gesturing towards a sign, and Hitchcock then shows a brief shot of the door with a 'closed' sign on it, where presumably they're inside having sex. It's subtle and yet also feels daring for the period. Ivor Novello did a fine job with the evolution of the character, and in the nice bit of role reversal we see when he becomes a gigolo, he conveys the disgust for where he has fallen to in life well. Overall this is one you have to be patient with, but it's got enough good moments to make it worth seeing.",1
3,"I spent most of Downhill trying to figure out the motivations of the characters. Certain actions made no sense to me, where others only seemed to happen to further the plot. It seems that Hitchcock hadn't mastered the art of storytelling when he made this picture.",-1
8,"Originally conceived as a farce by its two authors, Ivor Novello and Constance Collier, it had a short run in the West End and longer in the provinces where Novello, who also starred, thrilled female fans by washing his bare legs after the rugby match!! The wit didn't transfer to the movie (only the title!!) the plot of which was so melodramatic it must have given Hitchcock, Novello and others of the sophisticated cast a bit of a laugh.The initial part shows Ivor as Robby Berwick, a school captain and star footballer at an exclusive English boarding school. He is lured into a threesome involving his best friend Tim, a scholarship boy and a grasping waitress Mabel (shades of ""Of Human Bondage""). When Mabel finds herself pregnant she makes a fuss at the school and picks out Robby as the father (even though it is really Tim) as she sees his wealth as a bonus. He promises never to break his trust as Tim cannot afford to be expelled. The nicest scene in the movie for me is when Robby is left in charge of the little shop, a boy comes in with a halfpenny and Robby sells him a box of chocolates, next thing all his little mates are at the door waving halfpennies - very funny and a chance for Ivor to have a bit of fun.Alfred Hitchcock finds a way to add some wonderful touches - his title ""the world of make believe"" shows Robby, thrown out of home, is now working as a waiter. The couple move from the table and he then discreetly pockets what looks like a wallet but suddenly the camera moves back and you find Robby is a waiter - in a play, the two he was serving are the stars and elusive Julia has once again forgotten her cigarette case!! Isabel Jeans just sparkles as the money hungry Julia, she thinks Robby is a sweet boy but Archie (Ian Hunter) is the one who pays the bills - that is until Robby comes into a 30,000 pounds inheritance, then suddenly the society pages carry photos of Robby and Julia, his wife. She still hasn't given up Archie and both of them continue to bleed him dry until ..... his inheritance exhausted he becomes a gigolo!!It is when Robby can't go any lower that Hitchcock is able to experiment with unusual shots - a descending escalator to show his downward spiral, dream sequences, intensified by his delirium, that blur all the people who have bought him down sitting at a table playing cards. Perhaps the finest of all (in my opinion) a montage of super imposed images starting with the squalid lanes of the East End, then each street getting a little bit neater and nicer until Robby is back in his own gentrified surroundings.An excellent film that shows some innovative Hitchcock touches.",1
10,"In ""Downhill"", Ivor Novello's character life goes all downhill after a false accusation made by a girl who ruins his life as a rich schoolboy. He lost his only friend (Robin Irvine), abandoned his family after being thrown out of school, and all that happened because a pretty girl falsely accused him of getting her pregnant (there's a whole debate over what was the accusation because the film doesn't explain it so clear), which was a shocking thing at the time considering the societies conventions of the period.In a stunning dramatic exercise, way before his suspense films Alfred Hitchcock presents in ""Downhill"" the story of a man who lost everything trying to protect others but not himself, rejected his father because the last didn't believe in him, calling of him a liar, but this man realizes that he made a big mistake but not telling the truth to anyone, living a low-life with people of inferior classes, marrying with another troubled girl and more. And everything (methaporically and literally) spins around and around over this poor guy, so it's all downhill.This was my first experience on watching a Hitchcock silent film and it was a great pleasure to see how everything about it was brilliant, important, the way he moves with his camera, edition, direction of actors, the whole package. Novello's performance as the main character living in a constant delirant state, showing a sorrow that doesn't need to be overacted or appear to be so emotional, no, he has an expressive face that says more than we can see, you can feel his desperation and sadness in simple gestures. There's some bit humored parts (the fight between Novello and his wife lover at the apartment) that calm down the almost depressive story.One of my favorite parts (and to you might sound pointless) is a transition scene that fools the viewer in a magic way. Right after Novello left home we see him working as waiter in a restaurant, attending a couple that walks away from the table and start to strangely dance followed by other people. The image opens up without cutting and we see a stage, musicians and a whole crowd watching the dancers scene, Novello and other waiters start to dance too and we are fooled because he's not a waiter, he is an actor in a musical play. It's a very humorous transition scene and way ahead of its time, very brilliant and well made.I watched the film in the Public Archive (the link is present here on IMDb) so there's a few things to complain about their version, and another one that helped me watching the film. First: the final minutes of the film are missing, very significant five minutes (gladly, I found the missing part on YouTube). Second: their version doesn't feature the musical score presented in it which leads to the thing that helped me watching it; I selected classical musics to go with the film and that was very clever of my part, because the absence of sound (in this case) made me think on other things than the film, the problems of life and things like that. But after watching ""Downhill"" hearing instrumental music made the experience even better, and it wasn't distractive as I thought it would be. So my suggestion is that if you watch the film in the Public Archive do that, listen to Tchaikovsky, Strauss or film composers scores, that will help you a lot.From the very first scene at the school with the boys playing in the park until the last similar scene at the ending, ""Downhill"" justifies only the story as being a downhill thing, because looking at its magnificence it's a memorable and upper film. One of Hitchcock's best works even though it's not a work of suspense. 10/10",1
3,"I would've thought Hitchcock's twist on the prodigal son parable, featuring a young man's slow descent into madness, wouldn't have been nearly this boring or forgettable. With as much nuance as an after-school special, the only real insight is into Hitchcock's own messed up relationship with women and women's sexuality.",-1
7,""" . . . Women,"" and seldom does he make his case more clearly than in DOWNHILL. True, he gives us the embezzler who tries to come between Norman and his Mom in PSYCHO, the serial thief who gives James Bond the cold shoulder during MARNIE and the harlot who breaks Cary's heart because she's so NOTORIOUS. What about Bob's stable of necktie-wrinkling dames dirtying his dry-cleaning FRENZY or SUSPICION's auto-wrecking wench, not to mention that dizzy ski bum dame cavorting through SPELLBOUND? Then there's that falling floozy VERTIGO vixen villain, plus the terrible torch lady of SABOTEUR and ROPE's ""Please play 'Misty' for me"" gal. Plus it's so easy to forget REBECCA's fatal female, since that awful amnesiac cannot even remember her own name! However, none of Hitch's other single word-titled films feature as many wicked witches as DOWNHILL. First, there's the gold-digging perjurer Mabel from the bun shop. Then there's that bigamist actress spouse, Julia. Don't forget about Madame M., who rents out Rod for 50 francs a pop. Or the clients of her bordello, whose masculine mustaches are only overshadowed by their weight. With such a horde of horrid harpies, jaded Jezebels and slovenly strumpets leeching away his life, Rod is reduced to rubble.",1
4,"A slapdash early effort by young director Alfred Hitchcock, ""Downhill"" a. k. a. ""When Boys Leave Home,"" delivers moments of brilliance undone by an underbaked plot.Young Roddy (Ivor Novello) is expelled from his boarding school when he is charged with a major infraction involving a woman at a local bake shop. No use appealing to his father, who stares at him with frightening disgust. Roddy makes his way alone in life, coming up against a pair of theatrical con artists before landing in a seedy music hall, providing dances for lonely women at 50 francs a whirl. It all gets to be too much for the frail boy.Poor Roddy can't catch a break, even in cyberspace. A lot of reviewers, both here at IMDb.com and elsewhere, have at the fellow for one deathless line he delivers when his headmaster drops the hammer: ""Can I - Won't I be able to play for the Old Boys, sir?"" It's a line dripping with ingenuousness, but actually works better in context. Roddy is a true believer in the code of his school who runs up against a world that doesn't allow for second chances.Based on an adaptation of a play Novello co-authored with Constance Collier under the pseudonym ""David L'Estrange,"" ""Downhill"" pushes the action from one setpiece to another with little explanation or character development. Hitchcock seems far more enthusiastic about his set pieces and camera tricks than giving the viewer anything to hold onto. Even dialogue cards are kept at a minimum in this very non-verbal silent film.The best sequence, a section called ""The World Of Make-Believe,"" plunges Roddy into the harsh world of show biz, where conniving actress Julia (Isabel Jeans) and her significant other Archie (Ian Hunter) set up a suddenly cash-rich Roddy.Watching Archie as Roddy pledges his love to Julia, smoking and drinking and looking frightfully bored as he awaits the chance to offer his casual blessing to their ersatz union, features terrific acting from all concerned. Hitchcock does well in this section by playing up the humor of the situation. But when it's over, there's no explanation or attempt at grounding things. What's this kid going to do about his new marriage? We just follow Roddy to his next stop on his downhill journey.Hitchcock presents us with some arresting images. One favorite of mine shows a daytime view of Roddy's boarding school dissolving into a scene of London at night. Anyone curious at how England looked in the 1920s will enjoy these views for their travelogue value, anyway.Novello is worthy, too, carrying the film as he must. He's too old for the part, but believably earnest even as he goes from bright student to all-around chump. A better film would give us more of a basis for this, but all we get is some eye fluttering from Novello to tell us of his deer-in-the-headlights state. It worked for Novello's female fan base at the time, but not for us.Hitchcock too often works in this surface manner. He shrugs off any subtlety in pursuit of the big effect. The worst of these feature Roddy's father, Sir Thomas (Norman McKinnel), who bears a striking resemblance to Nosferatu and shows up late in the film in Roddy's wracked point-of-view in a slew of implausible guises.Still, I was interested enough in Roddy's journey, if only as a matter of historical interest. Early on, we see he is the genuine article, a real believer in the world he inhabits, holding a cap emblazoned with the word ""Honour."" There's a scene, arrestingly similar to the deconstructive Lindsay Anderson film ""if"", where Roddy and his friend meet that girl in the bake shop. No playing tiger in this one, Roddy just dances with the girl a little and tries to make a polite exit, but the damage is just as much as if he broke out the tommy guns like Mick and company in that later, anarchic classic.""Downhill"" is a coming-of-age movie that only really works as a look at Hitchcock's own coming of age – before he arrived.",-1
4,"Alfred Hitchcock, despite all his ability, was undeniably a largely mechanical filmmaker. His approach was one of planning and manipulation rather than aesthetics or feeling. Not a bad thing in itself, so long as that cold mechanical mind could be put to the purposes of intrigue and excitement, as it would at the peak of his career. The trouble then with his earliest efforts is that they have all that technical intricacy without that much needed focus on reaching the audience as entertainment.His silent films in particular seem to lurch all over the place, and are proof that the term ""experimental film"" generally means a bad one. After all, if you know how to do it properly you don't need to experiment, do you? Downhill, unlike the films made immediately before and after, has less of the camera trickery that characterises Hitch's early work, the exceptions being a couple of mobile point of view shots in the Headmaster's office scene, and the rather extravagant finale, which believe me is nothing compared to the obtrusive bag of tricks Hitch employs in, say, Champagne (1928).Instead, the director focuses far more on the expression and gesture of the actors and the cunning arrangement of shots to reveal what is going on. Much of this is technique that Hitch appropriated from screenwriter Eliot Stannard, who actually predates Eisenstein in theories of montage, and the various inserts of reactions and concurrent bits of business – like the crosscutting from the courting couple to Ivor Novello dealing with the young customers in the shop scene – seem to fit in with the theories Stannard set out in film articles in the 1910s. A more Hitchcockian manoeuvre on display here is the beginning of scenes with close-ups, with gradual pull-back-and-reveal shots to give context. Often the opening shot, focusing on a single character or an item like a cap with the word ""honour"" on it, serves almost like a chapter heading. Gradually the shots become wider, giving more context to the scene, often finishing with a hauntingly empty wide shot – one that in another director's work might introduce a sequence. In one scene Hitchcock playfully confounds our expectations several times over, by starting with Novello in a posh outfit, pulling back to reveal he is in fact a waiter, then pulling back again to reveal the restaurant is part of a stage set.This more subtle approach by Hitchcock is very welcome, but the trouble is he seems a little over-confident in his own abilities. Downhill contains very few intertitles, but the action is not quite coherent enough to make up for them. The shop scene in particular is very confusing, and synopsis writers cannot even seem to agree whether Novello is being falsely accused of stealing or getting a woman pregnant. The latter is less obvious but makes much more sense. The focus on people and their actions is a bonus at least, and we get to see a bit more character from Ivor Novello as compared to his rather leaden personality in The Lodger, but the handsome chappy still cannot really act. And it's nothing but mugging and crazy stares from the rest of the cast, I'm afraid.But perhaps I am missing the point. The incident in the shop could be regarded as an early example of the ""MacGuffin"" – an otherwise unimportant device which serves only to drive the plot forward – and as such its details are of no consequence. And certainly, this rather trite plot of a man disowned by his family for some social misdemeanour, who descends the slippery slope until he ends up becoming a gigolo for fat French women is certainly one which could bear a bit of style over substance. And isn't it in some ways the essence of cinema to conjure up atmosphere or visual delight, with coherence and plot detail being of secondary concern? All this is true, and yet the purpose of a motion picture is to tell a story, whether it be the ostensible one of plot, or an emotional one at a more human, character-driven level, and this is something Downhill fails to provide.",-1
7,"Without Alfred Hitchcock's inventive camera, I'm not sure I would have enjoyed this movie as much as I did. It's largely predictable and doesn't come to a resolution that I think properly utilizes some of the elements within the story, but it's fine. With Hitchcock's emerging talent, inspired heavily by German Expressionism, the story gains a cinematic edge that pushes it up in quality ever so slightly.Roddy is the king of his prep school in Britain. He's from a wealthy family, scores winning points in rugby matches, and gets appointed as the captain of the school (whatever that means...Britain, amiright?). When he and his best friend Tim decide to join a low class working girl at the baking shop she works at for an afterhours jaunt of dancing and fun, Roddy falls into a lie that he won't extricate himself from because it would harm his best friend Tim. You see, the girl was trying to make love to the son of a rich man Roddy but ended up with Tim instead. She comes to the school some time later with a charge of prostitution against Roddy and the accusation that he is the father of her unborn child. Based purely on this accusation, Roddy is expelled from school, Tim refusing to take any blame because he had just gotten a scholarship that could get him into Oxford and the news of his failure would destroy his father.Roddy's father isn't too kind on his son either, as it goes, calling him a liar to his face. Unable to take the insult, Roddy leaves to make his own life.This first half hour is full of shadows, little camera moves (my favorite being when the girl is in the headmaster's office to accuse and she can choose between Roddy and Tim, she steps forward towards camera, the camera pulls back slightly to reveal the two young men on either side of her in frame), and strong performances that sell the story. It's also where the movie feels the least formulaic.The second part starts with a seemingly effortlessly ingenious shot that starts with Roddy in a tux, as it pulls back and shows that he's actually a waiter, and then it pulls back again to reveal that he's actually a bit player in a theater production, all preceded by a title card that says, ""The world of make-believe."" It's a very good precursor to what is to happen, for Roddy is hopelessly in love with the lead actress, a fashionable and famous women with very expensive tastes and a man who feels that Roddy is no threat. When he suddenly comes into thirty thousand pounds, he instantly uses it to woo the girl, and the girl and her man instantly recognize it as an opportunity to swindle the young man. The further downfall of Roddy is predictable, which makes this section less compelling than it could be, but it's still well filmed and well-presented overall.The third section sees Roddy having made his way to Marseille where he dances for cheap with lonely old women in a dance hall, in seeming perpetual debt to the matron of the place. It's when the shutters are opened and sunlight shows Roddy the drunkenness and ugliness around him that he realizes how far he's fallen. Disgusted, he runs to the docks where he will waste away. Some find him, think he'll be a good source of money if they take him back to certainly rich friends in England, and shove him on a boat on the southern coast of France heading to the United Kingdom. In the five days Roddy spends onboard, he has a series of delirious visions (all given a sickly green filter) of his father and the people who've abused him through his journey. It's a rather harrowing experience, and he climbs off the ship, still delirious, seeing his father's face in a policeman's, and staggers home.This section is a step up from the second, feeling less predictable and more like actual drama, combined with some of the most visually inventive moments of the film.It's the coda of the film, where Roddy makes it home, that I have a real issue with. Tim never appears again in the film once Roddy says goodbye to him at the prep school. Since he is as much the orchestrator of Roddy's misery as the girl, I felt like he needed to appear at the end in some capacity. If I were writing it, I would have probably had Tim, now a successful young man in business, fully admit his fault to Roddy but refuse to do anything about it again, because I am a heartless idiot who does terrible things to my characters. The fact that he doesn't appear at all feels wrong to me. Instead, Roddy just goes home where he discovers that his father has found out the truth and all will be well. It's not a terribly compelling ending.As a showcase for Hitchcock's emerging visual style, it's a wonderful relic. As a drama, it sort of works, though it's ending needed something more. The acting is really good, especially from Ivor Novello, the actor who plays Roddy. He sells the innocent determination and slow degradation of his character really well. It's a good little example of Hitchcock learning his trade and producing quality content in the silent era.",1
7,"Classmates and close friends at an English public school, Roddy Berwick and Tim Wakely compete for the affections of a local shop girl. When the girl falsely accuses Roddy of getting her pregnant, he is expelled. However, Roddy remains silent to protect Tim, who was the guilty party, and the friends make a pact to keep silent. Outraged at his expulsion, Roddy's father does not believe his son's claims of innocence and throws him out. Thus, Roddy strikes out on his own, and his life begins a downward spiral from stage acting to a disastrous marriage to taxi dancing to the Marseilles waterfront. ""When Boys Leave,"" also known as ""Downhill,"" was Alfred Hitchcock's fifth completed film, and, early on in his career, the master director explores his oft-repeated theme of the wrongfully accused.Shot in 1927, the film is silent with inter-titles, and the black-and-white cinematography is often well lit with striking visual compositions. However, Hitchcock generally holds the camera steady, and movement occurs within the frame. The film lacks the camera fluidity common among movies of the late silent era, although Hitchcock is already a master of visual story-telling, and the inter-titles are brief and sparse. As Roddy's life reels out of control, he is dwarfed by his surroundings in rooms with impossibly high ceilings and doors that are more than twice his height. Fortunately, Hitchcock elicits naturalistic performances from his cast, and none indulges in the grand style of acting that negatively stereotyped silent movies. Ivor Novello, a Welsh matinée idol best known for his musical talents, plays the suffering Roddy quite well. Isabel Jeans as Julia Fotheringale, a spendthrift actress, and Ian Hunter as Archie, Julia's shady lover, provide amusing support during one colorful episode in Roddy's descent.""When Boys Leave"" is from Hitchcock's apprentice period in England, when he was still learning the craft. While the story is thin, and the motivations vague, this short silent film shows flashes of the genius to come, and, for students of the master, every Hitchcock film is worthwhile viewing.",1

10,"This was Hitchcock's fourth film, after his first hit, THE LODGER, and with the same leading man, Ivor Novello. The latter was a very effective silent film actor, romantic and dashing (he resembled the young Fredric March). He takes direction well from Hitchcock, playing a man whose reckless ""honor"" sets him on the downward spiral of a vagabond existence.Hitchcock plays with camera angles and editing techniques that were innovative for the time. The use of the hand-held camera to denote visual unsteadiness, the montage of disturbing images to denote delirium, and a generous use of close-ups. It's the style here of a true artiste that is most impressive.Novello made 16 silents, two of which are lost. He proved himself quite a bad sound actor and only made six talkies. Film's loss was the theater's gain as he composed the music for and rote the librettos for 8 grand London operetta extravaganzas between 1939 and 1952, making a greater name for himself than his acting would have provided.This is one of Hitchcock's most impressive early films. The genius was there from the start.",1
5,"If I have to see another character go downstairs, I swear I'll watch the film in reverse! The plot is quite basic - nothing really new: chump plus a couple of manipulative floozies equal his downward spiral. Hitchcock wisely didn't work consciously with symbolism for most of his career and this one makes me happy he didn't! There are a few good scenes here. The characters in the cab photographed from the outside during a rain worked quite well. The super-impositions were very well done and the collage of London with its usual turmoil in the streets made its point of ""business as usual"" effectively. There was some rather heavy over-acting by Novello near the end that can be painful to watch. The depiction of Paris seemed as French as the English music hall. Hitchcock was learning to fly with this but as of its release, he hadn't earned his wings yet.Curtis Stotlar",-1
6,"My copy of this movie is truly silence with no musical score. Whenever I watch a movie that is completely silent, initially I find it a little hard. But when the film is well made, as this one is, it doesn't take long to adjust and focus on the story as you are drawn into it. I feel Hitchcock was a master of the silent film genre with his ability to tell such a deep story with very few intertitles. Relying instead on the expressions of the actors and written notes and signs in the movie, without having to cut away to an intertitle, which allows the film to flow more fluidly instead of constant cutting between the live action and the title cards. Ivor Novello in the lead role of Roddy and in his prior work with Hitchcock in The Lodger really impressed me with his talent of conveying his feelings strictly through facial expressions and acting without the use of sound. Hitch is also good at using subtle exaggeration and focus on action to help take the place of the sound in his silent films. The story is that of a young man in school who is falsely accused of theft by a lady that he had danced with and he is willing to take the blame for a friend of his and is expelled from school. This leads to the downhill spiral of his life as leaves home after his father calls him a ""LIAR!"". Things get worse from there as ends up working as a gigolo in Paris, getting in fights, losing a large sum of money, and eventually hitting bottom.In this film we really begin seeing a lot of Hitchcock's visual style that he is so famous for. He has some really good use of fades and graphic matches between scenes. Two of my favorite where the fading out on the pocket watch and into a large clock, and the other being the scene where he fades out on a photograph and then back in on the real person. I really enjoyed the symbolic shot of Roddy heading down the escalator, showing us that is in heading downhill in his life. And my favorite ""Hitch"" shot in this movie was the point-of-view shot when the lady was leaning back in her chair and it cuts to Roddy walking into the room and we see him upside down on the screen. I also thought Hitchcock did a great job of portraying Roddy's seasickness towards the end of the film. I really enjoy seeing Hitchcock's style developing in his early silent films, that will become so prominent in his later, more famous movies. I also really appreciate Hitch's working in comedic scenes into his serious movies. My favorite humorous scene in this movie is the peashooter scene early in the film.Without giving too much away, I would have liked to see a more typical Hitchcock ending to this film. *** (out of 4 stars)",1
6,"""The Boy in the Plastic Bubble"" was a made for TV movie which gave John Travolta a chance to do something beyond his lunk-head character on ""Welcome Back Kotter""...and just before he shot to super-stardom with ""Saturday Night Fever"". He plays a young man who was born without an immune system and the show details his difficulties dealing with having a plastic wall always between himself and the outside world. The problem becomes MUCH worse when he falls in love with the girl next door and he realizes he probably will never be able to touch her.The story is based very broadly on a real case. Travolta is decent in the role and the film is a decent family movie, though the ending is a bit bizarre as it leaves you on such a cliffhanger. I liked it as lot as a kid--seen now, it just seems okay. Generally enjoyable and well written but the ending is a letdown...at least for me.",1
6,"THE BOY IN THE PLASTIC BUBBLE is another interesting US TV movie of the 1970s, a time when the stations seemed to make one quirky little gem after another. This one stars John Travolta right on the cusp of stardom, playing a miracle kid born with a compromised immune system which means he has to live inside plastic sheeting to separate him from the rest of the human race. If he catches a common cold then it could well kill him. That's a tragic premise for sure, but one which is handled sensitively here and with a surprising (and thankful) lack of sentimentality. The production values are solid and the supporting cast features Buzz Aldrin, no less. I've always liked Travolta and even though he's too old for his role here he's likeable and goofy enough to make his character work. This reminded me a lot of the kind of Children's Film Foundation movies that Britain was making during the same era.",1
6,"Tod Lubitch (John Travolta) was born with an immune deficiency and forced to live in a sterile bubble. He cannot touch anybody. He lives with only his parents and the few visitors are mostly doctors like Dr. Gunther. Gina Biggs has lived next door since her childhood.Here's the thing. This is all about the two teens and they're both a bit too teen. When they're behaving like teens, it can be hard to take. The movie has a romance tone but I question whether this is romance or lust. It probably doesn't matter. Quite frankly, Glynnis O'Connor has limitations as an actress. She has only one or two gears to play with. It's also very weird to see a half-naked Travolta in a bubble. It's close to camp. That one image of Travolta in short-shorts inside the bubble is worth a thousand words. As for the spacesuit, it needs to be white to be a cinematic spacesuit. The biggest aspect is Travolta. He has his boyish charms. He has the million watt smile and that's a little problematic. He's a superstar trapped in a bubble. It's weird.",1
6,"O.K., perhaps sweet isn't the right word for what John Travolta goes through in this T.V. movie that ranks up there with the best of them from the 1970's. It was a big deal in 1976, and while today's audiences might either look at Travolta as an aged joke or view sentimentality as dated as rotary phones, but that aside, this was a daring view of a potentially tragic story that needed to be told.Playing the supposed real life Todd Lubitch (actually fictional) who spent years in a totally germ free and sanitary environment while trying to live life like a normal teenager. Falling in love with next four neighbor Glynis O'Connor, he decides to try to go to school, all the while hoping for some kind of release. Health scares involving lack of air, causing more concerns for his guilt ridden and overly devoted parents (Robert Reed and Diana Hyland).As far from his early successes on T.V. and in movies as he could be, Travolta shows tremendous vulnerability. It's easy to see why he got the breaks he did. Ralph Bellamy gives a sincere performance as his lifelong doctor, with future ""mama"" Anne Ramsey in a small role as his prickly, sherry drinking nurse. There's one scene in a hospital with another boy in a plastic bubble that has unintentional gay connotations as they broach the subject of masturbation. This ends up being a nail biter towards the end because it never is clear as to what the worst that could happen would be. This was said to be a true story but evidence has proved that not to be true, although there were similar cases with younger real children. That doesn't diminish the impact even though it did provide false hope for the real life victims of similar ailments.",1
6,"John Travolta effortlessly made the leap from TV Sweathog to teenage heartthrob with this popular ABC movie-of-the-week, executive produced by Aaron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg, about a boy born without immunities who is taken out of the hospital after his first four years to live at home in a germ-free zone. The adults of the piece (Robert Reed and Emmy-winner Diana Hyland as Travolta's parents, Ralph Bellamy as his doctor) are good, but audiences in 1976 were mostly interested in Travolta's presence. He doesn't give a multi-layered performance--he's overeager when trying for simple charm, and he's least convincing in situations where he's meant to be hurt--but, for a newcomer, he certainly displays enormous self-confidence and charisma. Girl-next-door Glynnis O'Connor rolls her eyes and grins like she's never talked to a boy before (which may be the fault of director Randal Kleiser), although the two match up well in the puppy love department. The film's final moments--aimed directly at budding romantics--is a bit much, yet overall it's well-made and memorable, a touchstone movie for kids in the '70s.",1

It is about sex - specifically, about the desire for sex between two young people who are obviously falling in love.

8,"1976's ""The Boy in the Plastic Bubble"" has gained legendary status in the careers of both John Travolta and Glynnis O'Connor, for it is due to their performances, and the genuine anguish in its depiction of budding adolescent love, that this TV-movie still endures beyond what all of the naysayers would have you believe. The early scenes with the very young Tod do tend to be overtly cloying, but it immediately establishes the young Gina's attitude toward her new neighbor, at one point actually calling him a 'monster.' As the years pass, she really only sees him once a year on his birthday, the only girl in attendance, now simply looking at him as a curiosity. Once the exposition concludes, the film can take its time with their relationship, how he's always watching her from his expansive pad, isolated from any germs that could easily spell death for him. It really is a marvelous script, Glynnis O'Connor's Gina at first willing to humiliate Tod just to impress her friends (among them Kelly Ward, Vernee Watson, and P. J. Soles), but gradually coming to realize how much he has idolized her, which both flatters her and scares her (""Tod, what are you doing to me?""). Yes, it may be carefully calculated, even contrived, but when the actors deliver, it has the desired effect. As for the ending that so many dislike, how could they conclude it any other way? SPOILER AHEAD- As Paul Williams sings ""What Would They Say"" (uncredited in the film itself), Tod chooses to be free to pursue his only love, leaving behind the dedicated parents responsible for his well-being, still asleep and unaware, equal parts heart warming and tragic, just like the angst of teenage love. No matter how old we get, we never forget that first love, or the obstacles that needed to be overcome, which Williams beautifully renders as Gina rides away with Tod at her back, toward a future unknown. What a delicate balance that couldn't be bettered, and it remains difficult to watch to this day without tearing up. Robert Reed, just as in THE BRADY BUNCH, is a warm and loving father, and this film, along with ROOTS, reignited his career back toward drama. Diana Hyland will always be remembered as John Travolta's first true love, tragically dead of cancer less than five months after this broadcast. The natural smile, fresh wholesomeness (even in a revealing bikini), a sweet girl next door quality that every boy fell in love with- the 19 year old Glynnis O'Connor was a huge cult figure at the time, on a par with Maureen McCormick, Jodie Foster, Tatum O'Neal, or Kristy McNichol, but appears to be criminally forgotten nowadays; she would continue to score impressively in films such as ""California Dreaming"" and ""Those Lips, Those Eyes."" Only months away from ""Saturday Night Fever,"" John Travolta's movie career consisted of a bit in ""The Devil's Rain"" and a supporting villain in the just completed ""Carrie,"" his dramatic capabilities as yet untested, so this sensitive but not saccharine portrayal was very real and precise (how about the reference to masturbation with fellow inmate John Friedrich, when they easily could have shied away from an honest depiction). This movie's cult should continue to grow, in spite of the dated 70s fashions, despite the raspberries from numerous hipsters, simply because the heart never stops yearning and no one forgets their first love.",1
7,"RELEASED TO TV IN 1976 and directed by Randal Kleiser, ""The Boy in the Plastic Bubble"" is a youth drama inspired by the true-life stories of David Vetter and Ted DeVita, both of whom lacked effective immune systems. John Travolta plays Tod Lubitch, a teen born with immune deficiencies in Southern Cal while Glynnis O'Connor is the girl next door with whom he slowly develops a relationship and inspires him to crave freedom from his germ-free 'prison.' Robert Reed & Diana Hyland are on hand as his parents.The opening act is relatively dull, but it's necessary because it establishes Tod's situation. Thankfully, the story perks up with the star power of Travolta and O'Connor. The former was 21 during shooting and is quite good as the protagonist while O'Connor is winsome as ever. She was almost 20 during filming and has a bikini sequence for those interested.At its heart, this is a coming-of-age movie but with a unique twist (the bubble boy). There are several well-done high school sequences, like the football field scene where the kids sneak away to smoke pot. Unrealistic? Not at all.The best part is the ending where we share in Tod's joy and sense of wonder at the most simplest things that normal people take for granted. I can relate because when I was his age I fell off a cliff and ended up in traction and a body cast for four months. While in the cast, I was laid-up at home on a lake, just like in the movie. When the cast was removed I walked with crutches to the woods & lake with sheer delight.The real-life bubble boys David Vetter and Ted DeVita were still alive when the movie was released. The former died in 1984 at the age of 12 & a half while the latter died in 1980 at the age of 18.THE FILM RUNS 1 hour, 36 minutes and was shot in Malibu Lake and Century City, California. WRITERS: Douglas Day Stewart and Joe Morgenstern.GRADE: B",1
6,"Remenbering my teenagers years when this movie aired for first time in Brazil by Globo TV in 1978, based in real facts about the boy who was born without immune system, so the doctor developed a bubble added with device to supply sterile air to secure him against bacteria, so he lives inside the bubble since then, the movie made a huge success at this time even though it a low budge and lousy work, also catapulted John Travolta's career before Staying Alive, unfortunately the DVD released here has a poor image needing a complete restoration, it's a crying shame that so important movie didn't has it before to sell, but even so brings me good memories from this time!!!Resume:First watch: 1978 / How many: 2 / Source: TV-DVD / Rating: 6",1
6,"Here is a film for the pandemic! This is the story of a boy born with no immunity from disease, meaning he has to spend his life living in a germ-free bubble. This is one of the first starring roles from John Travolta and its one which relies on the goofy, dumb charm he brought to his early appearances. It's a TV movie from Aaron Spelling and it is melodramatic with a requisite romantic sub-plot involving the girl next door but all that basically works and we are rooting for germ-free John the whole way and we hope he gets the girl! Scenes of him wearing a space suit to school or chilling on the beach in a plastic box, are a bit dorky but that's part of the over all charm. Pretty good!",1
7,"When this movie was made, John Travolta was at the height of his popularity as the tough guy sex symbol ""sweathog"" Vinnie Barbarino from the TV series ""Welcome Back, Kotter."" Obviously, he had plans to become a major star and to do that he would have to demonstrate some range of ability; he would have to show that he had the capacity to take on a very different role and make it work. Certainly he managed to do that as ""Tod Lubitch - ""The Boy In The Plastic Bubble."" This is an obviously made for TV movie in both budget and quality. In fact, I think I remember watching it when it first aired. Still, it's a pretty good movie with an interesting subject. In spite of what it claims, I don't believe it's really ""based on a true story"" except in the sense that there are people who live with this problem. There was no Tod Lubitch, though. The character is (at best) a composite of people who live with the condition and an imagining of what their life must be like. According to the movie, Tod is born with an immune deficiency - in fact, with no active immune system - so that he has to be constantly kept in a sterile environment, able to interact with people only through the plastic walls that constantly surround him. Travolta, who takes over the role after brief accounts of Tod's life as an infant and as a 4 year old, does a good job of showing Tod's growing frustration with the limitation he has to live with and of his desire to be free of it, as well as of his growing feelings for his neighbour Gina, with whom he falls in love. Tod experiences a growing independence, up to and including attending high school in a sort of space suit and graduating. When Gina makes her decision to go to art school in New York City, Tod is left with a decision - to stay in his safe but sterile (in every way) environment, or to take the risk of walking out into the world. In the end, he enters the world, and the last scene is of Tod and Gina riding off on a horse together (a bit too romantic a scene, perhaps) so that Tod's ultimate fate is left unknown to the viewer. Instead, we're left with a strange combination of hopefulness but also anxiety - a somewhat unsatisfying ending, I thought.The supporting cast was good, but this was Travolta's movie. There were some plot problems created by the scene in which Tod runs out of air in his suit and has to run back to his ""bubble"" in the classroom before he suffocates. He just runs right into the bubble. Wouldn't his suit have been contaminated? And after he goes in, a classmate - who lost a $10 bet to him - slips the $10 bill right into the bubble. Again, wouldn't it be contaminated? Plot oversights aside, it's a pretty well done and interesting story. 7/10",1
4,"Several years ago, when $1 DVD bins were in the front of every discount store in America, you could find hundreds of copies of The Boy in the Plastic Bubble – many with different artwork. It was one of those movies that budget DVD companies just loved – a (I'm assuming) public domain movie you could slap John Travolta's face on. I'm sure they sold thousands of those things. The Boy in the Plastic Bubble tells the story of Tod Lubitch – a boy born without an immune system. The slightest hint of a germ could kill him. He spends the first few years of his life in a hospital until his parent decide to bring him home. Tod lives in an enclosed, sterile environment inside the Lubitch house. Jump forward about 12 years and we see Tod as a fairly normal teenager – well, as normal as you can be living inside a plastic tent. He's smart, gets along with his parents, and enjoys spying on the neighbor girl, Gina. Tod takes classes via closed circuit TV and eventually attends real classes in a special enclosed suit. He's doing all this to be closer to Gina, not necessarily to learn. But in the end, will this be good enough and will he ever get out of his bubble?I sat down to watch The Boy in the Plastic Bubble the other night. I don't think I'd seen it since it originally aired back in '76. I had two distinct memories of the film – 1. It was incredibly sad. 2. Glynis O'Connor's bikini (the stuff of 13 year-old dreams). How did it hold up 40 years later? Not as well as I had hoped. It's still a decent enough story, but now I see problems I didn't necessarily notice (or care about) before. There are way too many moments that make me cringe as I watch them now. Travolta overacts in a lot scenes to the point that I felt embarrassed for his character. I know he was meant to show innocence and all that, but he just looks stupid. Another thing that bothered me after this view was the ending. I don't care for it. (SPOILER) What are we supposed to think? Are we supposed to think that Tod just walked out of his bubble and he and Gina lived happily ever after? Are we supposed to think she threw away her dream of going to New York for some guy she's had minimal feelings for? And are we supposed to assume that Tod didn't just keel over a few weeks after stepping out of his bubble? If he did die, what a guilt trip to lay on Gina. (END SPOILER)I've watched several movies and TV shows from my childhood recently. Many of them are still as good as I remember. But not this one. The Boy in the Plastic Bubble didn't hold up for me. I'll rate it a 4/10.",-1
7,"I'm not sure why this movie is disliked among some, maybe because it's loosely based on a true story? A 5.6 rating certainly isn't bad, but it's way too low for a quality film like this one. Sure. It's corny at times, but that doesn't make it any less moving. I have to be honest. I was one of those people that thought I was gonna dislike it after the groan inducing opening, but it proved me wrong. It was one of John Travolta's first starring features and it shows why he went onto super stardom. I don't think I've seen someone with a handicapped be this cool to be honest. What I liked about it is it managed to balance all the sentimentality with sharp humor. When I first went into this one, I thought it was gonna be full of sap, but I was pleasantly surprised at all the sharp humor. It also helps that Tod (Travolta) is very likable and sympathetic. If the lead was unsympathetic, then it probably wouldn't have been as entertaining as it was. I also dug the cute little love story between Tod & Gina. It is somewhat forbidden due to Tod's condition, but I loved watching it unfold the way it did. I also dug how Tod's parents were written. They felt and acted like natural, caring parents should. You do have some clichés like the typical bully fodder, and the ending was rather artificial, but other than that, I really don't have much to complain about. John Travolta is excellent as Tod. His charm is undeniable, and he gives a really sympathetic show. He was perfect for the part. Glynnis O'Connor is a total cutie. She has her wooden moments, but overall I dug her for the most part. Her chemistry with Travolta is good. Robert Reed & Diana Hyland are very effective and natural as the parents of Tod. Note: Interestingly enough Thanks to some IMDb Trivia. I found out Diana Hyland & John Travolta fell in love off screen before she sadly passed away. Final Thoughts: Everyone has a right to their opinion, but this is a good film. I really don't understand the average rating for this film. Travolta proves why he was meant for super stardom here. It's on You Tube, so I'd definitely go and watch it if I were you. Give it a chance!7.5/10",1
6,"I remember seeing this on tv when I was a young teen, I enjoyed it much more back then. It's pretty corny and after school special in its style, very much a product of the 70's, cheesy. Good nostalgia buzz all the same. Story follows a boy born without an immune system, doomed because of his birth defect to live in a completely sterile environment, never knowing human contact. His parents set up a germ free plastic room in their house and the boy grows up to be teenager John Travolta.The Brady Bunch dad (Robert Reed) is the dad here again, Travolta is very young, he does a decent job, its just feels awkward to see him acting so childlike, temper tantrums etc. His character is also a bit strange. He falls in love, attempts high school in a spacesuit. The ending is weird, not sure what happens there, one of those and then what?",1
9,"John Travolta before his Saturday Night Fever and Grease fame, really got to show his acting shops. As a teenager born with a rare immune system. And that he can't even go outside the world. And has to live it in a plastic bubble.As he grows up, he wants to go outside the world. And wants to see it beyond his bubble. But that is hard to do. Due to his rare disease he has. And the overprotection of his parents, played by the late Diana Hyland and the late Robert Reed.He falls in love with pretty Glynnis O Connor who is cruel to him at first due to his condition. But then, after what happened at the beach changes her attitude on him.He must decide either to follow his heart and love meaning impending death. Or stay in a bubble for his health and protection.Travolta was in love with Hyland eighteen years his senior and would later die of breast cancer. He dedicated his Emmy Award to her. Touching and great TV movie!",1
4,"Travolta clearly had not yet learned how to act in this movie... unless Grease would be a sequel to this nonsense. Yeah, sure... that has to be it: Grease IS the bot in the bubble part II and Travolta just moved from one state to the other, from A to B, from introvert to extravert. Unfortunately in real life things have gone less pleasant for Mr Travolta, and the boy in the plastic bubble sucks in it's overalls...",-1
4,"The Boy in the Plastic Bubble: This is going to be a weird one. There is so much to unpack here. First of all, let me confess I watched the Rifftrax version of this film. It is a bit of a strange choice for Rifftrax. This, after all, is a drama writ large. It would be like a Rifftrax of Love Story or Terms of Endearment.The next thing to unpack is Seinfeld's Bubble Boy. He haunts this movie as it was such a wonderful parody of this film and circumstance. I spent the entire movie with the phrase ""It's Moors"" stuck in my head. The third unpacking is the cast of the film. You, of course, have John Travolta in short shorts. His real life love interest Diana Hyland who was 18 years his senior, divorcing her husband and unknown to both of them was about to get a tragic fatal disease that would not be out of place in the film itself. She, in a creepish aside, plays his mother in the film. I know I know it shouldn't matter. But like the actor playing Dexter marrying the actress playing his sister it illogically just seems. well creepy. On the plus side, we have Robert Reed, Mr. Brady himself, as the father and a very young PJ Soles as one of the high school kids. Also on the plus side, this really isn't that bad a movie. Though based on a true story it really doesn't tie itself to the true life (and much more depressing) real life escapades. Travolta has a light touch and the film seems to do a nice job humanizing the issues at hand. In addition, if you are watching the Rifftrax version there are some pretty good riffs to keep you smiling through the slow bits. Definitely a fun time with Rifftrax and an interesting curiosity piece for those watching without.",-1
3,"The director of this TV-movie wants to make you cry, but it's mostly laughs that he'll get out of you. This is the story of a kid born with no immune system. At 16 or 17, the kid, played by John Travolta, is quite attracted to the girl next door, played by Glynnis O'Connor. But what can you do when you're stuck in a plastic bubble? Why not just walk out of there and go ride a horse! That's exactly what's going to happen. This movie is ridiculous but gives you a good laugh. Good when you have nothing else to do... I give it a 3, and I'm generous.",-1
10,"Indeed,what would they say? That is,the cast of this film if they could see how time has only served to treat this above par TV movie,like it's some sort of 1970's retro-joke?! I'm sure if Robert Reed were alive today he'd be outraged! My main thought though,does Travolta know about this? ...and if he does,why hasn't he done something about it? If I were an actor I'd certainly find a way! I bought this on VHS in 1997 after having not seen it for over 18 years. On the cover of mine is a fairly young Travolta wearing a white turtleneck. (Ick!) It was a mere $2 at Montgomery Wards and here's why...it was a cheap knock-off recorded off FOX Channel 32 in Chicago! The stations logo briefly appearing during the scene of Todd's fist day in High School.Okay,enough of the tirade! My opinion of the movie itself? I think it's one of the finest ""movies of the week"" ever made at the time and in some cases,since. I saw this in it's initial airing on Nov. 12th,1976 and never forgot it. Travolta gives us a waterfall of emotions in this film:Joy,Sadness,Anger,Fear,etc. Films about medical conditions usually would have been preachy or maudlin. This treats Todd's condition like it should be, not ""oh poor Todd,he's an outcast!"" Like Robert Reed says to the reporters,""My son's not a freak!"" He turns in a very good performance as well. He doesn't completely do a 360 from Mike Brady but it was a good start. The other young actors do a fine job of being exactly what kids are like when faced with something they don't understand. They talk about Todd behind his back and Gina plays a cruel joke on him at a beach outing. I wont say more about them,I don't want to ruin it for those who haven't seen it.It's no wonder that Travolta became as big as he did! ""Welcome Back Kotter"" was a mere stepping stone compared to this. This was his spring- board to ""Saturday Night Fever"" and beyond,in my view. To all those under 30 who haven't seen this....forget that it's made in the '70s and watch it for the story alone. I know you will not be disappointed.In closing,one amusing thing I remember. Without giving away anything,when I saw the ending back in '76 at age 8,I thought he was ""all better""! (Ha-ha,talk about innocence).",1
5,"I remember watching this on TV the first (only?) time it was run. I don't remember why I watched it; although I was a teenage girl when he was at the height of his popularity, I was never a Travolta fan and never got the hype about him. (One English class assignment in the 9th grade was to watch ""Welcome Back Kotter"" with the sound off and try to follow the story... I complained long and loud about having to waste a valuable half-hour of TV time watching ""Kotter"", although I'm sure the teacher chose it because almost everyone would have been watching it anyway.) I found the film on streaming last weekend and watched it again for a nostalgia buzz; discovered that the only thing I remembered was a few bars of Paul Williams' song at the end (never got the hype about Williams either). Strangely, the streaming version seems to have the same flaws other reviewers have mentioned about their DVDs; at times it squiggles up like I remember VHS recordings doing when they'd been over-watched or stored improperly.I guess the biggest problem I had with this film overall was the almost complete lack of tension. Todd seems reasonably content to stay in his bubble, with only occasional displays of frustration or unhappiness at his isolation. Okay, if he's fine with it, let's leave him in there and go make a movie about someone who throws hissy fits; it's more interesting. (Well, Todd did have one hissy fit... but it seemed over the top and out of place since he was so placid the rest of the time.)The supporting cast was kind of cool... you get to see P.J. Soles who was in ""Carrie"" (with Travolta), and Kelly Ward and Darryl Zwerling who were in ""Grease"" (with Travolta).Inconsistent, dull, simplistic. If it had a different actor in the lead I don't think I would have liked it any better, so I'm not hanging all the blame on Barbarino. There just isn't much here substance-wise.P.S. Add me to the list of people who are positive that's a sailboat, not a mysterious white-robed figure, in the background at the end... although I'll admit it gave me a start and I said out loud ""what the heck is THAT?"" before figuring it out.",-1
8,"I can still remember this movie when it was shown on TV back in 1976. I thought it was a good story. It still is, but I was extremely disappointed in the DVD release of it. It's a really bad transfer & the packaging that it came in is really pitiful. I can't understand why they (Essex Entertainment) would want to cheapen the best format in the world?There was also a huge error on it as well. On the disc they have: ""The Boy In The Bubble"".It's a shame that this great movie had to be wrecked by a very poor DVD release.",1
6,"I remember watching this movie as a kid back in the seventies. All I could think about was that John Travolta and Diana Hyland became a couple.Lots of memories of other made-for-TV movies featuring Glynnis O'Connor. Mike Brady played the dad - was nice to see him in a movie.Overall not terrible but not completely believable. I know there were children in real life who had no immune system and this movie portrayed that, but I doubt that the real-life boys with this condition ventured to school and had relationships like Tod Lubitch did.Ending was artsy fartsy.",1

3,"It felt like a bizarre reality show where the wife doesn't work and husband toils in a small anonymous cubicle and comes home to a multi-million dollar house.
The forced multi-culterism was off putting as well. 
There seems to be a trend in shows I've been watching (hey, maybe it's me) where 'vigilante' approaches are the way to go. It just doesn't work in the slighetst here, there's no feeling of being a hero, just rather a bunch of morons who react to everything out of fear (hello america...well, maybe not the moron part, but the fear part)
I have found most of the episodes to be rather conclusionless, but this one just took the cake.",-1
8,"Six months ago I walked away from a project that was incredibly important to me: to watch and review every single Sabrina. I was not mature enough back then. I didn't have the commitment; the dedication. In short; I was not a man.We open with a pretty simple gag. Hilda puts on someone else's sweater and is comically punished for it. Then Sabrina makes the same mistake. Sabrina laments that she can't just have an ordinary life. A theme that permeates the show.Libby is such a piece of ass. I mean man. Oh man.Sabrina wants to go to a Violent Femms gig and is joined by Libby, Gordo, Harvey and Hilda and Zelda; who refuse to let her go without them. In order to make them more acceptable to the group; they transform themselves into teenagers.This episode features an abundance of secondary characters all with their own plot lines. Zelda and Hilda are forced to confront the ageing process. Sabrina is confronted with peer pressure. Libby see's the dark side of idolatory and so on. An episode like this needs very careful management to ensure that each plot line is given its deserved share of screen time. For the most part the episode is successful in this regard.Zelda and Hilda learn to have a little more empathy for Sabrina and the challenges of adolescence. I spelled adolescence correctly on the first try and will now do the same with schizophrenia. Straight out of the park.This episode is home to one of the most surreal scenes I've ever seen in a Sabrina show. The band randomly breaks out in song for no reason and everybody stops what they are doing and dances. A strange folk like dance. The kind of dance you do on Harvest day. Its merry, familial, childish and a little disconcerting. With some hand held jovial shots. You can almost picture the cameraman dancing just as hard as the cast. Its made all the stranger by the fact that the music is real. The band is real. Our universe is bleeding into her universe of pure fantasy. There is no dialogue. No jokes. Its Sabrina Vérité and it all looks like it would be more at home in an Acid laced student film of the 1960's than evening network television.The way Hilda and Zelda scream when they realise they have changed back to normal but are still in teenage clothes is over acted but the crowd absolutely loved that joke in particular. You can actually discern five or six people in the sound mix; each individually writhing with laughter.Its really odd. I actually remember this episode completely differently. In my . memory, and I'm being completely genuine, Sabrina and Libby end up in a hotel room alone with the Violent Femmes. Libby starts getting pressured into sex and its up to Sabrina to stand up for her friend and stop her doing something she'll deeply regret. I still remembered the joke about the band loving Ren and Stimpy. That memory is completely accurate. Many years, two foreign languages, a degree and a failed relationship later I can't remember the plot outline. But I remember that the band loved Ren and Stimpy. That just makes me despair.Over all I had a blast with this one and I'm giving it an 8/10. I can't believe I'm back. I can't believe I'm back. I can't believe I'm back.",1

How he molds the stand, how he chooses and mixes the colors, and he talks the viewer through the different stages.

1,"I saw this film on a DVD compilation that is simply the worst and cheapest in film history. On one side is this production and on the other is the even worse ""Die Hard Dracula"". Both looked like they were made for about $32.99 and had production values that would make most YouTube posted home videos look like Spielberg productions by comparison! Cheap cardboard backdrops and freeware editing software made this film look just dreadful--and I hardly think the word 'movie' is appropriate for this....thing.If you remember any of the TV horror hosts from the 60s and 70s, then you can picture the quality of this production. I kept expecting Count Gore De Vol or the Cool Ghoul to come walking on to the cheap sets. And, in fact, a guy who does a burlesque of these hosts appears and introduces each of the mini-horror shorts. Each short share qualities such as cheapness, amateurish writing as well as equally amateurish acting. Overall, the production is a cheap crappy mess...and that's probably the nicest thing I can say about this.Oh, and you might wonder why I said this is the second worst film I've ever seen. That's because the other side of this disk (""Die Hard Dracula"") is the very worst.",-1

Some of them are not half bad like The Snatcher - it was kinda cute actually. But mostly... mostly it was kinda poor. But most of the monsters seem to be straight from the Halloween costume rental. And I do mean the cheap one.The ""party of monsters"" is particularly annoying, especially those two trolls or hobbit or something who do speak only together. They are just annoying.Even the quality of the video looks like from the seventies. Was this intentional? You know... even the taxi driver smokes cigarettes in the car. Isn't it illegal in the US like from about 20 years ago?Maybe this is just some amateurish retro effort, then it is probably okay. But I just do not believe this was made in 2003.",-1

Add to that some Jay and Silent Bob wannabe's, The Professor's crypt remade to be a wood shed (the covered up the windows and removed the Spencer's $19.95 discount knocker) and a Rabid Scooby Doo mask and we have 3 stories that absolutely do not deliver on anything ... horror, camp, or gratuitous boob shots. The sad thing is I really have to give the producers credit on 3 really unique story lines that really could have gone somewhere.

Even so, I found the doc interesting and well made, but it was just way too biased in the choice of experts and overall perspective to become convincing.
There is not one single mention of the fact that the Catalan economical elite was one of Franco's biggest allies and an integral part of the sectors in the whole of Spain who benefited the most from the dictatorship. Also, many of the current Catalan nationalists come from families who used to support Franco.. Is it relevant for the purpose of this doc? Not sure; but at least it deserves to be mentioned in a roughly 10-hour doc series, where the only perspective seems to be that of Cataluña as the oppressed and passive victim of history.",-1

To get revenge on Naomi, Liam sleeps with Jen. Later in the episode Naomi thinks it was Annie that Liam was with. She screams at her and kicks her out of her house. Very upset about this, of course, Annie calls the police saying there is an under party. Ethan finally admits that he has feelings for Silver and they share a passionate kiss outside. At the very end of the episode, Annie accidentally hits someone with her car and she drives off very quickly. Overall I give it a 10 out of 10.",1
10,"I'm really surprised this game doesn't even have a Wikipedia page. It's so well made! The sense of humour of this game is on a completely different level. I got this game on Epic Games in the form of separate episodes instead of the entire Season 1. So I had to download and play each episode separately. And trust me, it was worth it!3 out of 10 is a game that is based around Shovelworks, an indie gaming studio that never makes good games. None of its games have ever received a rating higher than 3/10. They even have a board in their office entrance which predicts the score of their next game. It's always stuck at 3/10, except in some instances where it goes to either 4 or even 2. The studio consists of 8 members - Jeb the dumb CEO, Midge the confused animator, Kevin the stubborn lead designer, Viper the aggressive VFX artist, Joan the nice old lady, Ben the bored artist, Pylon the green guy and Francene the annoyed HR Manager. All the employees hate each other's ideas, because of which they end up making a Frankensteined game called Swimming With The Sharks, which is supposed to be their magnum opus. They do get their interns, but they use them for a purpose I don't want to reveal.Every episode is very hilarious. The sense of humour used in this game is absolutely new. If this were a TV show there would have been a laughter track after every joke, and that's why I don't like to watch sitcoms. Occasionally between the cutscenes we get a gameplay from one of the arcade games that we have played previously. There are callbacks to DOOM, The Legend of Zelda, Death Rally, Midtown Madness, Snake Game etc. There is a retro console in the Shovelworks studio on which there are absolutely mediocre games that have a very complicated story but a simple, if not a terrible gameplay.My favourite character in this game was Viper. Every time he is on the screen you know something funny will happen. I like how he always replies about everything in context to blood and gore. He is like a more extreme version of those people who want to see violence and profane language in every piece of entertainment they find. But don't worry, there is no foul language or violence in this game.At the time of writing this review Season 2 just came out a week ago. I have completed both the seasons. I really want to keep seeing everything the game has to offer. This is such a unique concept, I think it deserves a lot more popularity than what it already has.",1
10,I loved everything about this game and hope you do too!,1
10,"""Seal Island"", produced in 1949, is known as Disney's first nature documentary and runs 26 minutes. It studies animal life on Seal Island, which is a small island in the Bering Sea. The life cycle of the seals is the dominant theme, of course, although the documentary talks about the other animal residents of the island too. Because it was Disney's first attempt at a nature documentary, it is awkward at spots. It tends to get very slow at one point, and then picks up the tempo with a bloody battle between feuding male seals fighting for dominance that tends to be a bit graphic.Disney was a pioneer in these kinds of films that are so commonly done today. Without today's technology this still stands up as being clearly photographed and being able to follow motion without giving you a headache. I'd recommend it but I know of no way to get your hands on it other than a DVD set that is now out of print and being held hostage by scalpers - ""Walt Disney Legacy Collection - True Life Adventures, Vol. 2"".",1
10,"A Walt Disney TRUE-LIFE ADVENTURE Short Subject.This excellent little documentary studies the saga of life ON SEAL ISLAND, one of the tiny specks of land in the Bering Sea. We witness the arrival of the bull fur seals, who stake out individual territory on the beach and await the arrival of the females. How the harems are gathered & the young tended is examined. Other inhabitants of the island, including its myriad & colorful bird life, are noted. `This is one of a series of TRUE-LIFE ADVENTURES presenting strange facts about the world we live in. These films are photographed in their natural settings and are completely authentic, unstaged and unrehearsed.' Winston Hibler is the narrator.",1
7,"The second film about Jarle Klepp (The first being ""Mannen som elsket Yngve"") is a charming story, well acted, actually superbly acted. But the story lacks some of the fun and music score from the first film.Jeg reiser alene is about Jarle getting to know that a one-night stand he had as a 17 year old rooster has resulted in a now 7 year old daughter. This comes as a chock, but not more than it should. What happens when this daughter is sent on holiday to her newly discovered father?This film is a character driven story. Well acted (little Lotte is fabulous) and there's good music here too, from back in 1994. The music is what made the first film so great. The time frame was perfect. Here there's too much muzak in between. Of course there's some great music from Pulp (Common people) and several from Bob Hund, but where's the kick we should have gotten from the rest? Well, simply not here.This film balances between a 6 and a 7. I give it a 7 because of the acting. The story is maybe a bit too thin, and obviously better in a book where you can imagine the things happening, and less successful as a film. A small minus also for some dialects not being easy to understand for everyone. The sound just isn't good enough. Subtitles would have helped. But all in all it was a nice time at the cinemas.",1
7,"House is in open war with Amber in NO MORE MR. NICE GUY, but the episode drags and House is way beyond his normal curmudgeonly self. After awhile, in fact, you wish he'd just disappear. While House and Amber duke it out, Wilson stays largely silent and Cuddy ends up playing referee. The patient this time around is a middle-aged man afflicted with being too nice, which House figures has to be due to a disease. No one can be that nice without being sick, he reasons. The man is married to one of the hospital nurses, played by an amazing actress (I think she is Bobbie Bergstrom) whose face in several closeups reveals an astonishing range of changing emotions. The episode falls flat all too quickly, however, and all I can think of is perhaps different writers may have been involved. Who knows? Maybe it's the director's fault. For those who have missed the old team, by the way, they play a bigger role in this episode. It's funny to see Cameron and her lookalike, 13, sitting near each other in a couple of scenes as they simultaneously try to figure what's wrong with their patient -- and House.",1
7,"Okay, for those of us that waited out the writers' strike that made this episode come out 6 months after the previous (and in the same season), this was pathetic. I love House, and could predict what the deal with House was from the second ""team #2"" diagnosed him. He faked cancer to make a point, and get what he wanted, an STD doesn't come as a shock to me. I am hoping this isn't a slippery slope into repeat episodes with a different team. Yes, the theory used in the show, about the bell curve, and who lies on the extremes, but there are exceptions to every exception. I thought for their first episode back from the strike, this was NOT the way to go.",1
5,""" Be Melodramatic "" just didn't work for me.Although the start was pretty good and the characters interesting, the drama got boring. They lacked the spark to keep everything interesting. Plus, the romance was corky which didn't help. Though, the characters were original, real and realistic. The performances were really good from all actors and actresses in the cast. Some of the side stories were interesting for a while as well. However, they had just too many stories to follow and they keep them entertaining for long.So, overall, five out of ten.",-1
8,"There are about 10 couples in this kdrama including the couples with two partners (one with a ghost), the gay couple, the parents, the side kick and even the little kid has his own love line. I only liked the writer-director. I give 8 out of 10 for the witty and comic lines of the director-writer couple, the couch conversation, the mom and daughter convo and the kid. I like the realistic acting of the director and the funny side kick/friend of the director. I also learned how arduous the work of a writer and director are and the product placements managers. They also showed the difficulty a person experienced from losing a love one. The song about the ""shampoo scent"" is catchy and gives good vibes.",1
8,"The start and the ending of this series are not quite catchy but what's in the middle is just perfect with a mix of melodrama and supreme comedy. The series was well-acted and shot. I just wish they too, more effort in closing this series. It felt very open as if they were keeping a door open for a second season. It would have been better to see a conclusion to the various relationships this series portrayed. Still, it is worth the watch. I recommend it.",1
7,"To simply put, this is a coming of age, female centric drama. It touches unique issues which can be hilarious or extremely heart wrenching, but give possible solutions to them too. The drama has an open ending to most of the main characters so, it's up to us viewers to give our own ending for them, however, at the end of the drama you will definitely feel light and good about it. Especially if you are turning 30 soon!Don't miss it.",1
8,"I didn't really have high expectations from this drama. It has a strange title (it makes scense once you watch it) and the synopsis didn't make me want to watch it at first. But I have to admit, that it's very good. It's literally the first kdrama, from the many I've watched so far, that did everything right. I know that most kdrama fans will disagree with this statement but let me explain. Good acting, good music (and most importantly not overused), good scenario, nice humor, nice dramatic scenes (but not to the point you want to cry all night long). I like many kdramas, but even my favourites lack on something. For example, ""Something In The Rain"" is one of my favourite dramas (not ony kdrams), but I have to admit that I grew tired of listening to ""Stand by your man"". Believe it or not I rated ""Something In The Rain"" with 8 stars instead of 9 because of that.To be honest this is not one my favourites. It's not the type of dramas I like to watch and it was hard for me to watch more than 2 episodes at once, unlike other kdramas. But I really enjoyed it. The only thing I didn't like, is some parts of the fast conversations, but only because I've watched its with subtitles and I didn't have time to properly read, so sometimes I had to pause or rewind. And some conversations were a bit weird, but this could be probably poor translation. This is,unfortunately, a problem,when watching a drama or a movie in a language you can't understand.By the way, it's not really so close to reality as some people wrote in their reviews, but it's ok. This is actually for the best because it's humor works better this way. There are so many things I could write about this drama (social critisism, witty humor, making fun of product placement etc), but I think I wrote what I needed to write.Edit: I forgot to mention that although it's supposed to be a romantic comedy, it focuses mainly on the everyday life of the characters (worklife, life decisions etc) and if anything it's mostly a comedy.",1
10,"This unheralded show deserves a full measure of praise. I am not sure why I started watching it but it's really terrific.No major name brand actors and an utterly conventional set-up featuring three heroines who are hitting 30 and angsting about their middle class single lives. So far, so what? Well, for one thing, this has a wonderful literate and inventive script, peppered with wit, sly (and sometimes laugh out loud) humor, and wisdom and insight. There are a host of well-acted supporting characters who engage our attention, no out and out villains but rather so many people striving to do well and occasionally to do right, stumbling as they go. The entertainment industry setting has a certain self conscious sense of ironic navel gazing, but it really doesn't matter. You yearn for our heroines' success, in work, in love, in life, and you follow their adventures with a mixture of anxious anticipation, sympathy and a wide smile on your face. A producer once told me that the reason people watch a television series, as opposed to a movie, is that the characters are being invited into the viewers' homes. In this series, please, extend the invitation.Before acknowledging the actors and writer in more detail, I want to offer particular thanks to the subtitle team at Viki, where I watched the series. Since this show is set around the genesis and pre-production of a drama series, it has many references to other Korean shows, including impish allusions to the very popular Reply 1988 in which the male lead, Ahn Jae-hong (here playing a successful but put upon drama director called Son Beom-Soo) also appeared. The subtitlers added translator notes to these and many other cultural allusions. In addition, despite the complexity and rapidity of some of the dialog, the translations were literate and almost error-free. A superb job.Now to the actors: The three lead actresses give wonderful, nuanced performances. None of them are Hallyu royalty, although Jeon Yeo-been, her career launched by her standout performance in After My Death and now (2021) starring in the Netflix series Vincenzo, seems on her way. She plays Lee Eun-jeong, a documentary film maker whose career is on the rise but who continues to be traumatized by the early death of her fiancé from cancer. Chun Woo-hee, previously perhaps the most prominent of the three, leads the way as Im Jin-joo, the scriptwriter who is getting her first shot at having her pilot script, ""When You're 30, It Will Be OK"", turned into a 16-episode drama. Finally, Han Ji-eun delivers a strong turn as Hwang Han-joo, the single mother whose stock in the marketing company she works for is rising. The three (as well as Han-joo's son) live comfortably with Lee Hyo-bong, Eun-jeong's gay younger brother, sympathetically played by Yoon Ji-on. The scenes among the four, as they confide in and comfort each other, are warm and often hilarious. I especially liked the scene where Han-joo, just to see their reactions, teasingly implies, to her roommates' horror, that she is considering going back to live with her good for nothing ex and the father of her son.Surrounding them are a substantial cast of other actors and actresses who infuse their characters with depth and substance. It seems unfair to single anyone out, but I feel bound to give it up for Baek Ji-won, playing Jeong Hye-jeong, as Jin-joo's former boss and herself a famous screen writer, whose tough exterior gradually collapses in the face of romance.This drama was underrated. I can't think why. For a refreshing peak inside the world of KDramas, with a stellar cast at every level and a truly witty script, go for it.",1
8,"This drama is one of the best k-drama i've ever watch.The acting is good.The story good.The joke is amazing.Alot of value.Good writing.Good and memorable dialog.
Character development is good enough.",1
10,I've been in Korean dramaland for 20 years (I'm in my mid 20's) and I've seen countless dramas.This is one drama with scenes I've never come across before. The whispering scene and unique slap dodging scene got me rolling on the floor. The PPL scenes were creative too.I didn't find the first few episodes interesting so I dropped them only to go back to the drama because of how much the Koreans were praising it. I'm glad I did because it only gets better.Similar drama: Age of Youth (slice of life drama),1
7,"I can really relate to this movie. Very interesting. Somehow in the few last episodes, it kind of getting slow and losing its rhyme by showing too many characters and their love life rather focusing on the 3 main characters. It will be great if they dig deeper on the emotions. Still it is a fresh and interesting drama to watch. Most of the actors/actresses are amazing and have good chemistry. Except for Han Joo character, it is very hard to watch the unnatural act from ms Han Ji Eun. But she has many rooms to improve in the future.",1
5,"The characters were nice and good lookingBut I'm sorry i feel the story is poor and the act is cold
I felt so bored from the first episode but i told my self to continue may the story get suspense but I still was borrd so i stopped watching at the seventh episode .",-1
8,Good drama where it explores relationships in deeper level,1
10,"Why I just watched this drama this year?! Why this drama just shown up right now? I LOVE IT! The reason I watched this drama just because it shown up at viu list. I start watching this drama without knowing either the casts and the synopsis. And because of that while watching this drama, there is no expectation at all and GOD I LOVE THE VIBES OF THIS DRAMA. The concept that their always having night talk together just somehow give me a slight dream to have someone beside me like them wkwkThe interesting part of this drama is, I got to know little bit about the process of making the drama, and its fascinating!! Its makes you to be part of the team wkwk Last but not least, the soundtrack. I love how this drama just having 3-4 soundtracks but still perfectly match with the storyline. You just need to watch this with no expectation and enjoy the drama~~~",1
9,"Wow. I loved this drama so much. For me, it comes under the category of the more realistic ""slice of life dramas"" like 'Hello My Twenties' or 'Because This Is My First Life'. It was witty, fast-paced, heartbreaking, hilarious, cute, embarrassing... all the things you feel in life. It was like watching my best friends live their lives on screen.Yes, there were many couples in this drama, some significant and others not, I do feel they equally shared the spotlight and everyone's screen time was evenly distributed. However I will say that one couple I would have loved a deeper breakdown of, was our LGBT couple.  Would have loved to expand on their story as I know it would have been a very interesting one.All in all, I immensely enjoyed this drama and I will definitely be watching a second and third time! Do not miss this!!! It's worth it.",1
4,"U took a full episode talking about farting , and ended all the series in one episode !! Didn't like the ending at all.",-1
10,"This one should go in the modern classic section.
That's how good the show is.The characters in the show are really well fleshed out.
Their dynamic with each other is fantastic.The show is funny when it wants and has a very fresh take on comedy compared to other k dramas.
The show displays pathos In such heartful manner that you deeply root for each character.It's really a very funny showIt's literally a show with no bad characters. Not one!
There are no black or white textbook characters,
They are human and have their flaws and even the stupidest character in this show make some sense in terms of their motivation towards their actions. And they all give a sense of comfort and security.Generally the female centric shows kind of repel people a little cuz it can lean into being preachy.
But this one's a breath of fresh air when it comes to dealing with those tropes.Acting was great too.
Han Ji Eun gives life to the amazing character Han Joo with her innocent caring and yet strong n competant mother.Jeon Yeo been playing the stoic Lee Eun jung is witty and poignant.Lastly Chun Woo hee was the most relatable as the writer Lim Jin Joo with her trivial struggles in Daily life.This one. For sure. Will stay with you.",1
9,"What a journey this was by the way. The actors, brilliant. The writing though even more so. They somehow managed to make a show full of life and unbelievable self awareness especially in the product placement bits. So creative and incredibly witty. The rapid fire conversations were a joy to behold in real time. The characters had so much depth and displayed such humanity. I'm amazed this isn't spoken highly enough. The cinematography was also good too nothing outrageous. But the story as light as it may appear had so much going on. The lives the women lived and the trauma they went through in the first episode (that set the tone for me) was gut wrenching but amazing to see how they fared and sealed with it. I'll give it a 10 if it was only 2 episodes longer just to see more of them god damit!",1
10,"This series plays like an audio book. The dialogues are fast, witty and rich in philosophy. The series is full of surprises and twists. It deals with relationships where comradery, love, friendships are explored in a deeper level. It does not follow typical k-drama cliches. You are expecting one thing to happen but something completely surprising and insightful occurs.If you are into the contemporary Korean language and want to learn more of literary devices such as alliteration, onomatopoeia, pun and etc, you will not be disappointed with this series. The current translation cannot convey all of it, but does a decent job.",1
10,"Korean dramas are known for their stereotypes. The overarching story may change, the genders might be revered (figuratively but in some cases literally), the girl might be rich instead of the guy, the witch may get the man instead of the princess, but the major beats are always the same; guy and girl are meant to be, blah blah gets in their way, they get together in the end.
True that some of the recent entries have tried to shatter major stereotypes (take Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo for example) but no kdrama breaks stereotypes the way Be Melodramatic does. Most kdramas start off funny and light hearted, then quickly shift to the same gear that every other kdrama does with over the top melodrama and sadness, oh so much sadness.
Be Melodramatic has surprisingly managed to balance the tears-in-your-eyes comedy, heart throbbing romance and poignant melodrama that never goes over the top in such an effective manner that I doubt any other kdrama comes even close. The fact that this is such an outlier in the cookie cutter world of kdrama might be the reason behind it's low ratings. In being so different, it may have alienated some of the typical audience members for this type of media. But if people aren't hyping this kdrama up to the max, they are making a mistake. This drama is awesome.
To those who are skeptical of this show, just watch episode 1 till the end. You won't regret it.",1
8,"I definetly recommend this drama, it so unique and well written. I love kdramas but most of the kdrama creates a virtual ideal reality that u will get a happy ending just like the leads or u will meet a handsome cute loving guy/gal etc.....but guyssss this will never happen..even if it did what happens next after that- this drama will show u the reality..please watch.",1
10,"It's everything you can ask for there is drama, comedy romance.
You will easily get attached with all of the characters finally a reality drama that you will relate to 100%A bounce
you must bring a tissue whenever you are watching because it will sure bring you to tears imma tell that you will cry an actual cry",1
6,"(*Chester quote*) - ""You know, maybe it was just an accident.""This episode of TV's ""Gunsmoke"" was aptly titled ""The F.U."".Its story all has to do with a crooked blackjack dealer named Al Clovis who tries to pull the wool over Marshal Dillon's eyes.Clovis is a pretty crafty gambler who unexpectedly gets his just deserts before getting around to reaping his profits.",1
7,"Everything is going nice until we get to the ending and the story comes crashing down. It just did not end in a way expected in a 'Gunsmoke' episode.Al Clovis is a gambler that has some highly questionable tactics. When a common farmer, Onie Becker, claims that Clovis dealt from the bottom, the gambler is set for a gunfight. Becker leaves but is later gunned down on Front Street.Marshal Dillon is highly suspicious of Clovis' action when he suddenly takes the train out of town. Somehow Marshal Dillon and Chester get aboard the train heading east and capture Clovis. But while the Marshal was away the Dodge Bank gets robbed. Matt believes that both situations are tied together.A common story that has been played many times in classic western shows. It will be the ending that will leave viewers scratching their heads and wondering what else happened. Another thing that was puzzling was how did Matt and Chester get on the train. I feel sure that if they ask the conductor not to leave before they check the train then it would have never left Dodge. Perhaps they got on the train at another stop which is rather unlikely since it was night time. Anyway there are some questions about the show but the most important question is, 'Can someone direct me to part Two'?",1
10,"**SPOILERS** I liked this one. Of course, everyone who watched drams like these realizes that when an innocent party to anything is just walking down the street, He's a goner. So it is with Onie. Problem is after Matt figures out what happened (this bit has been used before), the bank's been robbed.You've all seen the episode, and if you haven't, get it from Amazon and watch it; so you know that Chester is faked out, and the three guys who took the loot get away again, on horseback, in the rain. Now, I know everyone's P.O.ed at old Chet, but if he hadn't been dumber than a box of rocks, he could never have offered Matt part of his horehound stick as they stood there in the rain, could he?, and let's not forget that Matt stopped and stood in the rain, too.Truth to tell, they didn't always get the bad guys, and it could mean the end of a sheriff's or marshal's career if they got away with as much money as these guys did. Now, lets figure up the damages, okay? There were four bandits, including Clovis, who is now dead. If they were running the robbery the right way, they'd already made the split. This means $25,000 by 4 = $6,250 apiece. Who was it that killed Onie? Probably the leader. No smart murderer/gang leader is not gonna be ready for action, so HE'D be the one holding Clovis's take, right? The crap hit the fan, they take off, money and all. Really? A gang this ruthless,daring, and smart would have a real good escape plan. Here's how you do it. You always take the best care of your mounts, They're rested overnight, and as long as it takes Matt, Clovis, and Chet to get started and ride twenty miles to the shack they're waiting in. No barn, so their horses are fed and watered, and inside with the robbers. Even if you had to knock out a few wall boards to get them in there. YOU heard the storm comin' too, and you won't leave them out. You're all watching for Clovis, you see what's going' on, saddle up, throw on your slickers, out the door and out of there. Finding your tracks the next day's gonna be tough, too. you've got a long head start on Matt and Chester, and you're gonna split up from each other as soon as you can. IF you're the leader, you're holding about $260,000, compared to the other's $130,000.It didn't always work out for justice back then, but you know Matt's not gonna give up real soon, is he? If you know how these things really worked, sometimes the good guys just lost.",1
6,"I liked the episode up until the end. I thought Bert Freed played Al Clovis well as a slimy villain. I liked how Dillon was set up so the bank was robbed and how Dillon figured it out that Clovis was in on it. Also, Chester had one of his most hilarious moments, throwing dirty water from the wash bowl out the marshal's front door, accidentally hitting someone. The look on Dillon's face was priceless when he heard Chester say sorry. Hilariously funny.Everything went well till at the end Dillon had Chester hold a gun to Clovis while he went after the 3 bandits. When will Dillon learn? Chester says don't worry about a thing, of course Clovis gets the gun off Chester and Dillon has to shoot Clovis, Dillon's 79th kill. The noise enables the 3 bandits to run away and Dillon's horses run off from the sound of gunshots (they weren't tied). Dillon finally lays into Chester, but not enough. Chester messes up again, and as smart as Dillon is, why on earth does he still bring Chester with him? He probably would never killed Clovis if it wasn't for Chester's incompetence. The formula of Chester's screw ups is getting old and the ending stunk!",1
9,You really had to feel sorry for Matt in the early episodes. Having Chester as an assistant ( not a Deputy) had to so frustrating. With Quint Festus Newly and Thad to follow as actual Deputies it did get better. Chester's heart or courage was never a problem . Just his competence.,1
9,Finalment he didnt vet the and guy! Twists plot. Would lo e to know well Matt mas relibed back in Dodge. Chester is a hoot.,1
8,"The story is OK and has a good plot, but Chester shows his incompetence.Early on, Chester is making coffee. He's just adding water to the residue that's two days old. Must be scrumptious. Probably could cut it with a knife.At the end of the story Chester's guarding one of the crooks with Matt's pistol as Matt goes off to round up the rest of the gang and he basically gives the crook Matt's gun. Of course the rest of the gang ride away in the rain making it impossible to track them.",1
10,"""The F. U.""No explanation for the title! Can anyone explain where that title comes from? Sounds kind of risqué to me!For a show from the 1950s that title seems kind of odd does it not?What do you think?",1
9,"This film is one of many that are included in a collection of short films entitled ""Shorts: Volume Four"". This and the rest of the films in this series are interesting shorts made mostly but up and coming film makers.Considering that this was made back in 2005 and is not the product of Pixar, Fox or Dreamworks, it's quite an accomplishment. That's because the CGI graphics are absolutely lovely--and not in the usually ""cartoony"" sense. Instead, the graphics look a bit more realistic and I was especially impressed by all the attention to detail. With the mason jar, for instance, all the writing on the jar was there and it sure looked real. About the only nod to more traditional kids-oriented graphics is that the caterpillar's head looked a little cuter and less creepy than a real one--probably a good choice in retrospect.The short film has a very simple story that couldn't possibly happen but is entertaining. A caterpillar finds itself stuck in a jar in someone's bedroom. After a while, a mantis arrives and seems to delight in seeing the trapped bug. However, when ""the shoe's on the other foot"", it's up to the caterpillar and some friends to save the day.Well constructed and exceptional in execution, I can't wait to see more from these folks.",1
10,"As a filmmaker myself, with a short film on the festival circuit, I see a *lot* of short films. Rarely have any captivated me as much as The Mantis Parable, which I saw at the Santa Barbara Film Festival. One of the greatest difficulties of making a successful short is creating an emotional story that rings true in 15-30 minutes. This film does so and much more in 8.One-man-band Josh Stuab crafts a lushly animated tale of a caterpillar captured by an entomologist, who is visited by a malevolent mantis. The mantis soon comes to learn the Golden Rule after mocking the poor creature.Stuab sets the scene to an evocative piano theme and beautiful sound work, which do a spectacular job of setting the mood for imprisoned insects. The details strewn about the small desk and window sill in which the story takes place make the tiny space seem vast and intricate. What else could you expect from a director who got his start working on the Myst series?The story itself is very simple, sweet, and powerful. The film is available now on iTunes and a special edition DVD. I would certainly recommend the purchase.",1
10,"Anyone who gave this film anything less than a 10 was nuts! It was beautiful to look at, had a great story, and music which matched the story perfectly. It was a technical marvel. Most amazing thing is that one guy made it. All of it. The music, the art, the animation, everything! He sought no help from anyone and produced this marvel.I thought it was one of the best animations I've ever seen. I produce animation films and have been watching this film kick my film's butt all over the country...and deservedly so. I would recommend it for all ages. Ra",1
10,"Not only has Josh crafted a beautiful looking animated film, but also a fine piece of short form storytelling. Having seen quite a few animated short films, many of which fail to strike a balance between story and style, I was instantly fascinated by his approach using beings much smaller than us humans.The Mantis Parable provides something for everyone: lessons in the treatment of others and forgiveness, as well as an appealing color palette, fluid animation, and simple, yet effective effects work. The film will no doubt rank highly with other animated insect fables including: 'A Bug's Life,' 'Antz,' and 'James and the Giant Peach.'We can definitely expect more good tales (and hopefully longer ones too) from Mr. Staub!",1
10,"Without risking any spoilers, let me simply say that The Mantis Parable is a beautiful and touching, remarkably spiritual little film with splendid animation and excellent music. Like any really good and Truthful parable, the story does not make it obvious where it is heading, nor to where it will eventually lead. Also as in any great parable there is layer upon layer of meaning to it. I was extremely moved by it, suffice it to say I viewed it three times in a row upon discovering it. The Mantis Parable is really an almost perfect little work, amazing that it can cause a lump in the throat and a thrill of hope in the heart in only a few minutes time.I give it the highest rating.",1
10,"When I first watched the intro to The Mantis Parable, I was excited and eager to see the rest of the story. I was not in any way disappointed when it arrived. Here is a work that calls us to wake up a little, and take a closer look at the world around us and within us both. The imagery of The Mantis Parable is intensely real in it's simplicity, detail, and depth. The music is wonderful, and together with the sound effects, brings the events to life. There is adventure, suspense, longing, beauty, sadness, and hope - the drama of life - in this small tale well told. Sometimes haunting and provocative, sometimes delightful and fanciful, this carefully crafted animation deserves a place among the classics.",1
10,"The Mantis Parable rates a 10 on so many levels. The concept is at once thoughtful, poignant, instructive, inspiring and simple. The realization of the concept is poetic, thought-provoking, convicting and, as one viewer said, ""wounding"". The graphic presentation: animation, coloring, detail, set, lighting and visual context is exquisite. The more you view it the more details you notice. It is packed with nuance far beyond just the movements of the main characters. You always find something new to marvel or wonder at. The fact that there are no words, no dialog lets it be enjoyed be people of any language. It is often put in the children's category as a film but it should be seen by adults as well. It teaches, hence the ""parable"" in the title, but does not preach. It inspires, but does not push the viewer into a specific interpretation. The more I see it, the more I see different and deeper levels of meaning. The music also plays an important part, enhancing the visual and creating a gentle, almost magical atmosphere. (I understand Mr. Staub is the composer as well as performer of the score.) Many attendees at the Film Festivals at which it has been screened have concurred often voting Mantis ""audience choice"" and ""people's choice"" awards as well as ""Bast Animation"" in several festivals. Josh conceived the idea, realized it by himself at his home computer, wrote the music and directing and producing it all. The world should take note!! It's a very fine thing.",1
10,"This is a sensitive movie that can be used to generate conversation in a variety of settings. It is particularly good to use with children is small groups. Because it is a movie that can be viewed on different levels, it appeals to a wide age range. For parents, it has many wonderful conversation starting points. The marriage of music, animation and story elicits a variety of emotions. Whatever your age, you will recognize the situation and identify with the characters. It is a movie that deserves to be seen more than once as you will see something new each time. Much attention has been given to details and you will find yourself smiling in different places as you see new things and waiting in anticipation to see something that particularly appealed from a previous watching. This is a movie that you will want to own and share with others!",1
10,"This film affected me on so many levels. It was beautifully crafted, and the balance of brilliant color and music provided an exceptional foundation supporting the purity of the theme. There is something magical about the 8 minutes of perfect execution. The color and animated personalities all combine for an enjoyable experience that allows your imagination and personal depth of experience to relate to a sophisticated presentation of a simple theme. All who see it will relate on a personal level. The characters have personalities reflected in the unexpected but appreciated expression in their eyes. A flashback to a moment of insensitivity and the response teaches us all how to love each other and forgive.",1
10,"...especially for those of us with children. It's a blessing enough for a filmmaker to let the audience figure things out for themselves these days; it's even more so when such careful attention is paid to every aspect of the work: story, animation, music; etc.The story is made even more poignant with just a caterpillar and a praying mantis as the sole characters, and it's well enough written that it doesn't need any dialogue.The animation is first rate, with lots of nice subtleties, and the music is nice and really lends emotional support to the story.I hope to see more work from this studio in the future!",1
10,"I loved the Mantis Parable's craftsmanship, beauty and grace-filled storyline. This first-time filmmaker has won awards at major film festivals including Palm Springs, Hollywood, Santa Barbara, Seattle, Winnipeg, Chicago and Denver; PLUS MOMA (Museum of Modern Art), The Smithsonian AND the National Gallery of Art have secured copies for their archives. In this dumbed down entertainment age, those who still believe humans are capable of creating and receiving the good, the true and the beautiful, take heart! I offer you exhibit-A, Josh Staub and ""The Mantis Parable. This warm, provocative story reminds us that in the hands of a master storyteller and like all good parables, universal themes can be conveyed to people of all ages with simplicity and depth.",1
10,"Josh Staub uses his incredible creativity, both visually and musically, to lay the background for a tale of the highest morals. This short movie would make an excellent creative writing story starter in our public or private school systems. Technically masterful and purely heartwarming, the Mantis Parable places the viewer inside a glass prison, yearning to breathe free. With crisp audio effects, haunting piano accompaniment, and crystal clear graphics, this movie is enchanting and ennobling. One can easily relate to the caterpillar yearning to be released from his glass, mason jar prison, as well as feeling the resentment for the praying mantis and his flippant cruelty. All ends well, as both of God's creations find redemption and liberation through an act of selfless love and service.",1
10,"From the exquisitely written and played score to the masterfully and richly executed graphics, this story of compassion and grace touched my entire family when we viewed it for the first time last night. The story was magical in its portrayal of emotions from the arrogant mantis to the tender and meek caterpillar. We all climbed that twig with the caterpillar last night and felt empathy for all the mantises we've encountered in our lives with similar twists of fate. Mr. Staub showed us how we can become transformed not only as the downtrodden but as those who would seek to keep others down. And he did so with amazing sensitivity and creative and artistic talent.We will be hearing this man's name for many years to come.",1
10,"I really enjoy this animation because the subject matter was new and refreshing. I have seen hundreds of animations, but nothing concerning natural looking insects with emotions. The quality of the animation was professional. The mood of the scenes were nicely controlled with different lighting setups. The music score also helped to control the mood. The score was simple and direct without any extra baggage. I have been waiting at least a year for Josh to complete this animation, and then waited again for it to complete many animation festivals. I can understand now why it won so many awards. It was worth the wait, and I enjoy it immensely.",1
10,"In the three years prior to finishing this movie, we, the audience, were allowed to learn all about the true making of the Mantis Parable. After receiving several prices on festivals all over the world the only logical step was to release this beauty on DVD.The Mantis Parable is a great experience in storytelling, animation, composition (canvas as well as sound) and artwork. You can see that Josh has put more then just his heart in this little gem.I hope Josh will get a job within the film industry to ensure that his talent will be seen by many others. Because this is what he deserves.Just great!",1
10,"First let me say that I am a Myst fan so was already familiar with Josh's work. It was one of the primary reasons I bought his DVD. I can say unequivocally that I was not disappointed. This is a man of emerging talents who will go far in which ever field he chooses. The simple story was eloquently told and shows the mind of the author. The music was just perfect and went well with the animation. The DVD version also contains extra content about how the animation was created. This part is something I'll be sharing with my daughter, who is interested in a career in computer animation and programming. Now I just need to invite my Grand Daughter over to watch with me. I'm sure it will become a favorite with her as well. If you haven't seen it yet, I urge you to do so. The message pertains to all of us and the delivery method was outstanding.",1
8,"I really enjoyed this. I haven't yet acquired the DVD, but purchased it directly on iTunes. I'm not one who typically compares things, but rather, tend to look at things from the perspective of - is it worth $2 to have a slice of entertainment. If I'm entertained, then it was worth it. And I was entertained!I could see any parent of young children, as the new-era version of reading a book in bed with their child, lying down together with a laptop and watching this, then discussing its message.Firstly, I go to the movies ALL the time. I try to see about 150 to 200 movies, at the cinema, each year. But, I'm not a critic. I go to be entertained. I have only a little understanding of the CG science, art and craft, however, the 3-dimensionality of the graphics in this piece, the contemporary colors used and the personality created by the animation are excellent. The structure of the piece, and the genuine attempt to tell a good-hearted story, are endearing. As a solo piece of work, this is quite an achievement. Whilst the bar has been set high by heavyweights such as Pixar, one needs to get things in context and remember the enormity of such a task - from concept, storyline, story arc, characters, look, feel, imaging, graphics, construction, music etc., (I really liked the piano piece), and appreciate that this guy, did it all, as a one-man-show. I think it was an excellent effort, and genuinely a nice piece of wholesome entertainment.",1
10,"This film was emotionally captivating! Furthermore, Joshua Staub's attention to detail and ""bug"" movement was absolutely amazing. The fact that he is the sole creator of this film truly proves his artistic mastery over 3d animation, art directing, storytelling, character design, and post-production. It was colorfully charming and beautifully animated. Each frame was its own painting!!!! The camera movement was not intrusive, suspension of disbelief was attained and the personalities of the characters were bursting with energy. Thank you for the inspirational storytelling. Joshua Staubs is helping pioneer the independent 3d animated film movement!",1
10,"Wow...OK where do i begin?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? From start to finish you have this connection with the mantis and the caterpillar. The graphics, The colors, the way the characters interacted with each other was all amazing. The music fit with the entire theme of this film, It helped me feel more emotion while listening to it. It was very simple yet made you feel more strongly about it, it would be worse if there were no music and just sounds of the characters. I played Myst, and i love how the games always had a certain glow to it. The animation and everything and I never seen a movie capture that before. Thats why I really enjoyed the movie.I hope that Josh creates more short films similar to this. With him playing the piano as well. I really enjoyed it and can't wait to see more of his work :]]",1
10,"There is little to dislike about this animated feature, because even the smallest details are given the appropriate attention. The camera movement works well with the flow of the story; its placement accentuates key moments in the film. The rich colors are are evenly balanced, not too bright or dull. The lighting is advanced, with realistic shadows and depth. The characters move with an ease that belies their obvious complexity. The sound design is accurate to and complements each scene where applied. The music is moving with just a touch of earnest hope beneath it. It is a story with irony and a little bit of comedy for good measure, and as result it will give you pause to consider the golden rule. Overall, it is a study in the accurate deployment of artistic talent.",1
10,I love CG animation so I am definitely biased but I think anyone with an appreciation for genius will enjoy this short film. I stumbled on it unexpectedly and was amazed by it. The story is told so brilliantly without one word having been spoken. Visually it is stunning and leaves you in a better place after experiencing it. My three year old son continues to ask to watch it over and over. What my wife and I found incredible was how our son was able to create his own story with his imagination while watching this animated masterpiece. I highly recommend that you treat yourself to this gift. I will continue to follow Josh's work and look forward to the next creation! Thank you Josh!,1
10,"I read one time that the hallmark of a great film is when an audience can sit in a darkened theater, put all their differences aside and experience a ""community of emotion"" in those 105 minutes.Certainly, based on all the heartfelt reviews received from around the world, Josh's brilliant animation and portrayal of simple values through poignant storytelling has accomplished that. The Mantis Parable is a rare 8 minute gem that will continue to strike a universal chord with viewers no matter where you're from or how much time has passed since his film was made.This talented filmmaker left me wanting more",1
10,"I took my daughter to see the family short collection at the Indianapolis International Film Festival back in April of 2006 and she absolutely loved this film. As a film maker myself it brought me to choking tears to see her so happy and moved by an image on a big screen. She was at the edge of her seat wondering what was going to happen to the caterpillar. She got out of the theater and for weeks she was telling complete strangers about the film. Did I mention she's three years old? Forget ""Over the Hedge"" (which we also saw at the festival) it was all about the Mantis, the caterpillar, the jar and the butterfly.",1
10,"My only regret with The Mantis Parable is that it took me so long to get around to watching it. In my capacity as an on-air host for a Myst Online: Uru Live game podcast, I once interviewed Josh at length, and have met him in person in Spokane. Each time, I was deeply impressed not only by his considerable talents, but by his soft-spoken modesty as well. His contributions to the Myst game series have been pretty amazing, so I welcomed the chance to see what he could do on his own. It's easy to see that ""Mantis"" was truly a labor of love. It goes well beyond being a showcase of CGI technique, incorporating a beautifully-crafted story that is truly thought-provoking. It says so much in its eight minutes. Being the product of a single creator, the visuals, story, and music are tightly integrated into a seamless whole. Highly recommended!UruFan (normally known as Mowog)",1
5,"Written, directed, narrated and dubbed by award-winning female pornographer Doris Wishman, trading on the title of the big studio hit ""Perils of Pauline"", this super-cheapo one-woman soft-core show otherwise shares nothing in common with that legit project, neither in talent nor in budget, but still manages to amuse as a satirical ""cautionary tale"" from the sexual revolution of the Swingin' 60's.Just your typical ""boy meets girl, girl becomes prostitute, boy takes girl back anyway because he LOVES her"" story, but that's not what's important. What IS is the fresh-faced small-town girl's descent into the depths of degradation on a downward spiral of despair. recounted in ""shocking"" detail to her ever-understanding boyfriend, played by Tony Lo Bianco in his first movie as opposed to TV role, cast WAY against type relative to the sicko he'd ;later play in the celebrated ""Honeymoon Killers"",The rest of the cast's only talent seems to be the ability to take off their OUTER clothes (remember this is 1964) and smooch and writhe around in their undergarments--dig the horrendously bad ""drunk girl"" sequence, They don't even actually have to speak, the words being put in their mouths by Miss Wishman's (credited as ""Mati Hara"") narration.These get-togethers take place in an apartment with decoration heavy on ""exotic"" oriental art objects. I wonder, did the set designer (again, Ms. Wishman) find Fat Buddha's exposed belly sexy?To say the script is pedestrian would be to give it too much credit. Crippled is more like it. And ""Ms. Hara's"" reading of the lines her alter-ego Ms. Wishman (as ""Dawn Whitman"") herself wrote, well. let's just say Pixar won't be calling her to do voiceovers anytime soon, never mind that she's been gone almost 20 years by now.Dead in 2002 at 90, her last picture released posthumously, second last the year of her death. first in 1960. 31 shlocky self-produced ""features"" in a 42 year career (she was inactive during most of the 80's), right up to the very end! Such cheap ""efforts"" always rely heavily upon stock footage and a recycled soundtrack, and certainly no exceptions here,New Yorkers will get a laugh out of the few exteriors actually shot at midtown Manhattan locations that, amazingly, haven't changed in all these years...To start, busses from small towns in Ohio don't drop passengers in front of the UN as seen here, that's for diplomats in limos. And after a montage of her trudging around ""All day, all over the city,,after which I was exhausted"" she says, ""Then I had to find someplace to live."" (See what i mean bout the script?) Audience members in the know will recognize the montage of her walking ""all over the city"" consists solely of different angles of her walking around in circles around UN Plaza!The quick cutting of the trailer promises more sexy than finally actually ends up on screen here,, especially since some shots in it aren't even in this picture, which, at 55 minutes run time, certainly didn't need cutting, and borders on the customer not getting their money's worth, which would've been $2 in 1964, but Ms Wishman was also notorious for recycling her own footage, and probly squirreled those shots away to reveal them in a dreaded ""up-coming attraction"", which is how she managed to produce 31 ""features"" with NO MONEY.
Fun .",-1
7,"Claude Lelouch weaves together Vichy and German newsreels to paint a portrait of how they wanted to portray the war to those under occupation.Interesting look at how the Vichy government presented itself and the war to the people it was ruling over. More a footnote film rather than a full meal it moves along at a good clip and never gets boring. The film assumes you have some knowledge of the war since the narration of Brian Cox (in the English version) is geared to briefly putting what you are seeing in context of dates not for telling you anything particularly deep. The film is the march of the war across the movie screens of France, the deeper implications of what we are seeing is left for the passage of time and the viewer to fill in, we know how different things are because history has told us what really was going on. Some of the best bits are some weirdly chilling moments as the news reel narration is placed by Resistance broadcasts. In those moments time shifts and we are truly back in France during the Occupation. If there is any real flaw it's that we never see anything complete we see only clips. It would have been nice to see one complete newsreel so that we got a feel for how the news was presented.Recommended for those with an interest in how the war was seen by a conquered people.",1
10,"Claude Chabrol's excellent film documents the alternate history that the Vichy government, in collaboration with the Germans, proposed to the French from 1940-1944 via newsreels. A sinister undertaking, the puppet government of Petain attempted to show the collaboration with Germany as a good thing for France and a good thing for the French people. Meanwhile, men were being shipped off to work in German factories, French Jews were deported to concentration camps, and everyday essentials (like food and electricity) were being denied. This is a brilliant look at a time that is so outré, it's hard to believe it's such recent history. Each fake newsreel is more outrageous than the next, from phony unemployment numbers to propaganda cartoons featuring American icons like Mickey Mouse & Popeye. Chabrol offers no overt opinion and lets the footage speak for itself. An astounding, one- of-kind look at the German occupation.",1
8,"As one poster has already commented, this is a movie designed for those who already know what happened in France in World War II - a French audience, in other words. If you have that knowledge, it is indeed fascinating to see how the Vichy government used newsreels to shape French thought - a classic example of Big Brother in action. Watching this movie also requires that you put yourself back in the era to an extent, to realize the impact these newsreels would have had. Today, we get our news from endless different sources. In World War II, there were newspapers, radio, and what was shown at the local movie house. Since the government could control all three of those, it did. (Yes, there was also short wave radio, which was how the French got news from England.) What I would have liked at the end is a few sentences telling us what became of each of the big figures in the newsreels: Pétain, Doriot, etc.",1
9,"This is an awesome collection of archive footage from the Vichy regime. What sets it apart from countless surrogates is that today's 'commentaries' is kept to a bare minimum. A caption forewarns that the footage depicts France NOT as it was, but as the Vichy regime wanted it to be seen... Oh really? Isn't what media are all about, serving the powerful? But I suppose the point they want to make is that there are 'good' puppeteers and 'evil' puppeteers...Vichy was evil, while England or USA were good... It is no hatred encyclopaedia, either. You watch infomercials peddling fabric made of human hair collected at hairdressers' and of 'alternative fuel' for vehicles (I don't know how effective, but it shows that was doable in the 1940s, while today we're told to wait while the next cheque from oil producers clears in the pockets of the 'good' ones ). There is a lot of propaganda hailing Pétain (voted into power by the legitimate French Parliament in Assemblée Nationale 569 votes for, 80 against and 17 abstentions ), but Pétain appears rather sad and trying to make the best with what he's got. After the war they said the above vote was a joke and none had ever wanted Pétain to take power. Now Pétain's motto was to distance France as much as possible from ""l'affreuse aventure"" and the institutions that had caused it. Priceless is the NIMBUS LIBERE' cartoon depicting the 'liberation' of France: French listeners to Radio Londres are forewarned the 'good ones' are coming...overjoyed by the news, a family awaits because 'they are coming'...what comes, though, are allied bombers that bomb their house into oblivion. It is also apparent how Vichy represented the French who never fully (or at all) endorsed the Jacobin legacy of the French Revolution, but were closer to clerical and royalist values. Recommended for collectors and history amateurs.",1
8,"Film is the closest to a time-machine that we yet know, and this remarkable compilation of authentic newsreels from the Vichy period, (and let's not forget, the Vichy regime was officially recognised as the legitimate government of France by the USA, the USSR and the Vatican), are particularly chilling since so much of what the politicians and official spokesmen of those times said is unsettlingly close to much of today's political rhetoric. We hear of a United States of Europe, ""a New World Order"" that is ""all"" Hitler is seeking to achieve, and how `patriotism' is always free of dissent or criticism. That people constantly fall for this jingoistic rubbish is a cause for mourning rather than celebration, and these films clearly illustrate the overlooked historic fact that France was not `occupied' but had reached an armistice with Germany under the terms of which Germans were allowed to operate in the Northern sector of France. It also shows that Vichy needed no prompting from the Nazis to implement anti-Jewish legislation and eventual persecution and relied on good old French anti-Semitism to get away with it. This film also makes one wonder just how France was deemed `qualified' to administer a zone in post-war Germany, and how truly dangerous it was to be heroic enough to be a member of the Resistance. History is always written by the victors, but the uncomfortable gaps in their given version are exposed when you can see these shadows from the frontline experience. A vital and exceptionally important document.",1
6,"French documentary charting Marshall Petain's shameful administration in France during the Second World War.Excellent documentary, especially if you are studying this period.  In French.",1
10,"The DVD of this performance in San Francisco came free of charge with his album 'Want Two'. The film contains over twenty songs ranging from early releases to songs from his latest album. It also contains some previously unreleased songs, including the excellent 'Liberty Cabbage' and 'As In Happy'. Footage of the concert is also interspersed by short interviews with Rufus as he walks around San Francisco. The concert itself is all one would want from Rufus, who entertains not only with his songs but with anecdotes and jokes. A thoroughly enjoyable concert featuring Rufus with full band, including his sister Martha and Joan Wasser. Particular highlights are the songs 'Go or Go Ahead', 'Matinee Idol' and the previously mentioned 'Liberty Cabbage' and 'As in Happy'. My only problem was that the song '11.11' was cut at the end of the closing credits.",1
8,"I really really felt so so sorry for Claude, Marion shouldn't have bothered his head with getting into a affair with Sara. Although I think in my personal opinion that Marion could be a closeted bisexual but again, we don't know that much about him. I was literally crying when Claude committed suicide, Marion didn't help him with his life and like, I was utterly devastated that the pair of them weren't able to be together in the end. They would've been such a great couple to end a happily ever after but I'm afraid it wasn't the case this time! Seriously bring your hankerchiefs folks, this is a good strange romantic story that you would literally be glued on! I give this a 8/10",1
8,"Adolescence has always been a turbulent time. It marks the no-man's land between childhood and adulthood, where you have to balance your desires and needs with your obligations and responsibilities. Anyone too repressed is bound to crack, and anyone too carried away is bound to do something irrevocable. If you don't learn to maintain balance, you could change things forever.This is the lesson four schoolboy friends on summer vacation – Marion, Claude, Lindo and Jacques - learn the hard way. The stoic and firm Marion is seduced by an older woman, which teaches him about emotional balance; his devoted friend Claude strains under a secret passion; and Lindo and Jacques quarrel over a girl they both like, which escalates into a duel to the death...The story was written by Keiko Takemiya, an anime/manga writer who pioneered stories of relationships between males (both physical and platonic); thus the tale is sensitively written, mostly focusing on the boys, their personalities with both virtues and vices, and their development over the course of the film. The female characters don't get too much attention, but they serve as catalysts for the boys to react over and what time they have is well used.The feature boasts a rich, moody atmosphere to the tale, in which the animation changes according to the tone; romance and joy are portrayed in misty pastel visions, while passionate dramas are stormy and stark vignettes. One of the best scenes in the feature is of Marion finding Claude having a breakdown in a stable, which is both desperate and heartbreaking. The story also contains an air of impending doom and nostalgia through the viewpoint of an extended flashback, when the boys were younger and the outcome of the duel has already occurred...The voices are well done, featuring a cast of now-veteran voice actors who were in their early years (it's not often you hear Yamcha and Piccolo go to war over Luna LOL). The direction is also very good, displaying both restraint and expressiveness. But the top draws in this are the artwork and the music, which enhance the film's story and turn a standard coming-of-age drama into an emotional voyage and roller-coaster (with the latter slowly and unstoppably overwhelming the former).Overall, it's a very unique feature in anime, in that it's a mood piece (a rare thing nowadays, even for Western animation) and that it's one of the best mood pieces ever made. A great watch, and a heartbreaking ode to turbulent adolescence.",1
2,"Perhaps in revenge for the five films that exploited his species, the ""schlockoporous"" is on a murderous spree and thousands of victims are discovered, with only bananas as evidence. Through the wacky mind of John Landis (""Animal House"", ""The Blues Brothers"") comes this silly and mostly unfunny horror spoof that overdoes it on stupid characters, ridiculous names and idiotic pratfalls.There's also a very bizarre sequence in a movie theater where the monster goes to see ""The Blob"", deals hysterically with a woman in a hat (with bigger hair!), a boy who needs an escort to the bathroom, and a football player sized black man. He tears a car apart and reacts to the driver as if he was Oliver Hardy. But any creature who plays the piano and likes milk with his cake can't be all bad. This monkey business is completely bananas, goes on far too long (even at just 80 minutes), and doesn't succeed in making memorable at what it apes.Not only does this movie rip off the type of humor done much funnier in the Beach Party movies, it rips off Johnny Carson's recurring phony movie title skit from The Tonight Show. A letter falling off the police station sign out of nowhere is as funny as this gets with the gorilla claiming his victims in the most harmless of ways that is supposed to make him stronger than your average zoo gorilla. I admit that I did like the game of raspberries between the boy playing baseball and the gorilla, stupid I realize, but strangely amusing to my inner child. There's also product placement here, showing the gorilla reacting to the Chiquita banana logo like the prehistoric man in ""2001"" (same music, too!), something I'm surprised that didn't create a lawsuit.Between the Prince Albert in a can jokes and other really wretchedly ridiculous parodies, this is an example of why most comic spoofs of the ""Airplane!"" and ""Naked Gun"" variety failed miserably. Forget about seeing any real attempts at acting here. The people on screen, if acting in a commercial, would make me decide NOT to buy the product. The mentality is 10 year old boy, 1973 style (my age that year), and I realized that if you watch this through that perspective, you might be amused, if you aren't too ashamed to admit it.",-1
10,"In John Landis' directorial debut, he plays a prehistoric gorilla who gets loose and kidnaps a blind woman, thereby making a mess of the entire city. Sound like a nonsense plot? Maybe it is, BUT IT'S SO COOL! Basically a spoof of '50s B-movies, ""Schlock"" allows everyone to be as silly as they want, with hilarious results. Since Landis is unrecognizable in the gorilla costume, the only cast member whom I recognized was the woman who later played the receptionist at the girls' college in ""Animal House"" (what's her name?). All in all, ""Schlock"" is fun from start to finish. You might want to check this movie out if possible. You'll love it.",1
4,"After years of reading about John Landis' first, I finally got to see Schlock on YouTube. There were some pretty funny scenes like that reporter's plugging a dinner prize for anyone who can guess the number of bodies in a bag or his different descriptions of the movie See You Next Wednesday which is a title always mentioned or displayed on a poster in a Landis film. Or another scene in a movie theatre involving a woman with big hair. But if you want things to make sense, this movie is definitely not for you. In fact, unless you've seen some other classic movies like King Kong or Love Story, you won't get some of the lines at the end. Overall, Schlock is interesting and somewhat entertaining but you might have to be familiar with some of the other classic movies it references in order to really enjoy it. P.S. This was a Jack H. Harris Production as evidenced by other Harris films displayed in clips here, Dinosaurus and The Blob, the Steve McQueen version.",-1
4,"Back before John Landis became a big deal and killed Vic Morrow, he was making movies like this, inspired by 1950s monster movies. Landis wrote, directed and starred as the ape in this, wearing one of the first special effect makeup jobs by Rick Baker.Landis couldn't find anyone willing to release this movie, but then Johnny Carson saw the film, loved it and booked Landis as a guest on The Tonight Show. Clips got shown, Carson laughed and the film was released*.Schlock is a prehistoric apeman - you know, just like Eegah - who has come out of a cave into Southern California to terrorize some teens. He falls for a blind girl named Mandy who really likes him - well, she thinks he's a dog - until she regains her sight and realizes that he's a beast. That means that the military has to put him down, with Mindy quoting Love Story and a cop says the immortal final line from King Kong. As for Professor Shlibovitz, who studies the hairy creature, he comes out of the cave with the subject for a sequel, the Son of Schlock.Landis originally wanted to make an adult movie, but then found out that he'd have to work with the underworld. So instead, he got his family and friends to donate money and made this.*Jack H. Harris agreed to distribute the film if John Landis added ten minutes to the running time. He gave Landis $10,000 and allowed him to use footage from The Blob and Dinosaurus! Landis almost advertised that Steve McQueen was in his film, but didn't. Still, McQueen told him years later that he was owed money for Schlock.",-1
3,"I realize this film has quite a large base of loyal and devoted fans, but to be entirely honest, it undeniably remains a truly dumb and irredeemable amateur flick. In fact, the sole reason why I'm glad ""Schlock"" exists is because it meant the first venture into cult-movie world by John Landis; - and John Landis will always be the genius who gave us ""American Werewolf in London"". ""Schlock"" apparently did get noticed here and there, which ultimately led to Landis modestly building out his career further, first with the more crazed out comedies ""Kentucky Fried Movie"", ""Animal House"" and ""Blues Brothers"", but then he and Rick Baker (also debuting here) immortalized themselves with the still-fabulous transformation sequences in ""AWiL"".""Schlock"" is a type of slapstick and absurd parody about a prehistoric ape-monster, supposedly the Missing Link, going on extreme killing sprees in Los Angeles and leaving behind a trail of banana peels. I could still appreciate the first 10-15 minutes, since Landis exaggerates so tremendously with his numbers. During the opening sequences, the camera pans around a playground where literally dozens of dead bodies lay spread around. When ""Schlock"" attacks, he allegedly makes two-hundred victims at once and the local news reporter even organizes body-count contests on live television! It immediately goes downhill, however, with non-stop lame and infantile jokes, as well as reference to cinematic milestones (""Frankenstein"", ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""King Kong"", ...) that don't really work. There's a frustratingly high number of gags in which the monster is treated or addressed to like he's an ordinary human being, and those eventually make the film dull and tedious. After the first half hour (which seemingly lasts twice that long) the lack of financial means and creativity also becomes too obvious, and John Landis hardly still manages to hold the viewer's attention.",-1
6,Low budget comedy that helped launch the careers of director John Landis and makeup artist Rick Baker. It parodies everything from King Kong to Dragnet to 2001: A Space Odyssey and more. Funny stuff but it does lose steam the longer it goes on. Still worth a watch especially for Landis fans. I would also recommend the many would-be filmmakers whose crappy iPhone-shot home movies dominate the internet today take a look at how a proper low budget (really no budget) indie film can be done.,1
8,"Like EQUINOX and DARK STAR, SCHLOCK is an impressive low budget debut film; and, like EQUINOX, SCHLOCK was covered in FAMOUS MONSTERS OF FILMLAND. FM editor Forrest J. Ackerman had a bit part in EQUINOX (doing some voice-overs that were eventually re-dubbed) and an extended cameo in SCHLOCK (in a theater, which is where we would see him again, years later, in Landis's THRILLER video based on the Michael Jackson song). Though less refined than KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE, SCHLOCK has all the earmarks of a Landis feature: corny dialogue (and performances), over the top humor, effective use of slow motion (the ""2001"" sequence), and superb makeup and cinematic craftsmanship. Rick Baker's remarkable ape-wear (a cross between TROG and Bigfoot), seen throughout the movie in broad daylight, holds up to close scrutiny and Landis's performance is just as spot-on (in particular, the scene where he jams with a blind piano player in a scene that harks back to the scene between the blind man and the Monster in THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN). John Chambers (whose award-winning work included the fantastic makeup in the 1968 PLANET OF THE APES) has a cameo as a National Guardsman. The baby Schlockthropus at film's end helped set the stage for a sequel that never materialized (though it still could, even after all these years). Landis would be a logical choice to helm a Big Screen version of Jack Kirby's KAMANDI- with Rick Baker handling the makeup, of course. (Landis could also do a sequel to THE BLOB, now that Global Warming has started melting the Polar ice caps...)",1
5,"The Schlock really got its funny moments but there are parts that do not work very well or where the humor feels rather forced and some scenes are even rather boring. Also from a today's perspective I would add some real gore to spice things up. Therefore, I won't say that Schlock is a classic or cult (like other reviewers claim) or even a must-watch. But I am also not a great fan of director John Landis' biggest hit The Blues Brothers (good but not outstanding in my view). All in all, okay to kill some spare time - if you want to go on a nostalgic trip.",-1
7,"Movie fans know well the name of John Landis. From the seventies to the nineties he made some of the funniest films ever created. While we all may recognize movies like ANIMAL HOUSE, THE BLUES BROTHERS, TRADING PLACES and AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON, few know the very first movie Landis made when trying to break into the business. That film was available in some truly bad releases on disc and to my knowledge never on blu-ray. That's all about to change.Back in 1971 a young Landis, discouraged by the Director's Guild, went to see a bad movie called TROG. Thinking he could make a similar movie but better that's what he set out to do. Two years later the film was done, he found a distributor and SCHLOCK! was unleashed on the world.The movie opens to a town filled with dead citizens and a trail of banana peels. It's the work of the dreaded ""banana killer"". Tracking clues the police find...nothing. The local on the spot newsman reports from the scene ending his piece by telling folks to stay tuned for today's afternoon movie ""See You Next Wednesday"".Local teens walk the area where the banana killer was last seen before heading to the local dance that night. They discover a cave and search it only to confront the banana killer, an ape of some sort. Two escape with their lives and bring back the police as well as a local professor who hypothesizes that this isn't the work of a killer but the missing link that's been sought for centuries, the schlockthropolus.I could provide more of the plot but that's pretty much all you need to know. Yes this movie is a spoof of all of those long gone monster on the lose films combined with the ape movies that were prevalent at one time. It's a formula that Landis would go on to use to perfection with his next film KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE. He was responsible for the script here and many of the laughs show his love of old movies using plenty of slapstick style comedy in scenes as well as some witty dialogue.Made for just $60,000 it shows but that was his intent as well. He wanted to show that he could direct a movie on his own having been working in the business for several years at this time. The production value for being such a low budget film is better than many that have long since been forgotten by directors with much less skill. That Landis could pull this off is a feat in itself.The film also served as a kick off to a friendship and working relation that lasted for a vast number of Landis films. Looking for someone to create the man like ape for him he couldn't afford anyone he knew in the business. A suggestion sent him to a home where a young man was living with his parents and also trying to break into the business but in make-up effects. His name was Rick Baker. The same Rick Baker who would transform David Naughton into a werewolf for Landis in AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON.Landis has said that the movie isn't very good and that more than anything it was a learning experience for him. But the fact is it's better than he might recall. No, it's not a blockbuster film by any means but it has its moments. More importantly when placed in viewing order with his other films you can see the burgeoning talent that is there as well as watch the progression of his abilities from one film to the next starting with this one.This new version of the film is being released by Turbine Media Group in an exclusive dual-format mediabook Blu-ray/DVD worldwide-playable combo set limited to 2000 copies. Not only are they releasing it in blu-ray for the first time but the extras are as interesting as the movie itself. They include an exclusive new introduction by Landis, a newly shot interview with Landis that's informative and entertaining, vintage audio commentary by Landis and Baker from the 2001 Anchor Bay DVD release, Landis take on the film from Trailers From Hell, the original trailers for the film including its re-release title BANANA MONSTER, the original radio spots and an informative booklet with text and photos. The film also is a bilingual edition in both English and German.So if you're a fan of Landis work you'll want to rush out to buy a copy before they're gone since the print run is only 2,000 copies. If you love movies you'll enjoy this as much as his fans will. It's a lot of fun and reminiscent of a time when mavericks could pull together enough money to make a name for themselves with something like this before making major films. Alongside movies like ATTACK OF THE KILLER TOMATOES, SCHLOCK will be one to remember.",1
1,Why do they ever try to parody horror films when horror is an inherently self-parodying genre?Not funny. Get some real laughs off a real horror movie instead.,-1
10,"I actually saw this in the theatre where they filmed the movie theatre sequence just a few months before. I think the movie was only out for about a week, but my buddies and I caught it twice! Even dragged our drama teacher to see it (he loved it).This is the kind of high-school humor that was a carry over from the Three Stooges and is still going strong, but Landis was one of the first to bring it up to date.I think they shot this in 16mm (it looks it) and the photography has all the depth of a Wilderness Family entry, but the laughs are very much there. And this had one of the most memorable ad campaign tag lines in history: ""Due to the horrifying nature of this film, no one will be admitted.""It was also the only film I know of which had ads featuring a rave by Johnny Carson. It's low budget, but high yuks. I still remember it fondly (Hey, Landis, please return to your comic roots of the 70s and 80s; we don't need another Woody Allen).",1
3,"'Schlock"" is the often talked about, but rarely seen, first film from John Landis.  The story concerns a prehistoric ape man, played by Landis, terrorizing a California community.  'Schlock' is of interest mainly because of what Landis went on to do later. Is it great filmmaking...not by a long shot.  There are some good moments, but the comic timing Landis displayed in films like 'The Blues Brothers' and 'Animal House' just isn't there yet. I am a huge fan of Landis' work, but it's his first film...one shouldn't expect greatness.  The best thing about 'Schlock' is the ape suit made by Rick Baker.  It's very expressive, and seems somewhat out of place in this low budget environment.",-1
2,I'm almost 35 minutes in and haven't seen one funny thing. Complete and total failure as a comedy.,-1
10,"SCHLOCK is ridiculous, offensive, ignorant, and childish. It's also really funny, and it's now available on DVD with, yes, a great commentary track that you may have to listen to more than once; because in their enthusiastic recollections of making the film, director John Landis and special makeup artist Rick Baker reveal a surprising number of historical details. FAMOUS MONSTERS did an article on SCHLOCK way back in 72 or 73, with nice pictures of John Landis on location, wearing the hairy Schlockthropus suit...I didn't see this issue until 1979, I think, when I ordered a back issue; but when I saw the pictures, I said to myself, ""I have to see this. There's something profoundly fascinating about this!"" Maybe my curiosity was aroused by the fact that Landis directed the film largely while wearing a realistic ape-man costume! This alone seemed to be proof that something strange and perhaps even unnatural was going on here.Looking back on that time in 1979, I now realize my motivation for wanting to see the film so badly. The 70's were slipping away and I wanted to capture the ""flavor"" of fantasy films in the 70's. It was obvious, even before the 70's had wrapped up, that many films from this decade had a very particular style and tone--a very wild and innovative quality. This was some years before VCRs and home video releases were really commonplace; and I still had not seen the film by the time 1983 rolled around, although I had seen a couple of clips on the Science Fiction Awards show on TV. And that had only served to confirm something that I sensed about ""Schlock""--that it was unique and energetic. It just made me want to see it more. Some time in 1983 I was walking through a video store with a friend, looking at tapes to possibly rent. And there was the box. ""Hey, look, 'Schlock!'"" I exclaimed, figuring that we could maybe rent it. ""I've seen it,"" my friend said with real disdain. ""It's not very good."" For some reason I believed the comment, and forgot all about the movie for several years.And I think I FINALLY saw it in 1990 or something like that, after much searching; and it was under the title of ""BANANA MONSTER"" (I would've preferred the original title, but if a person had to change the title, ""BANANA MONSTER"" is as good a title as any). I don't think I ever laughed so much.This film is STRANGE. The title monster is unpredictable. He'll be friendly and silly one moment, and straight-up murderous the next. There is a song which repeats throughout the film, called ""Your Sudden Impulses."" So I guess this unpredictability was the main concept for the monster. On occasion he is quite frightening, and he does kill quite a few people, for example the entire ""Canyon Valley Metaphysical Bowling Society"" at the opening. A stimulating and sometimes unnerving farce comedy that is not devoid of blood. Quite a lot of fun! See it any way you can.",1
9,"So this is a shoe-string budget ($ 60.000) movie... It happens to be a brilliant movie for people who have kept alive the child in themselves. John Landis has a talent for making comedies.There are a number of fantastically executed gags in this one. Very deadpan. The body language of ""Schlock"" is absolutely hilarious.If you're only interested in today's slick, over-produced comedies as well as romantic movies in which Hanks/Stiller/Grant get their girl or if you need CGI, car chases, shootouts and explosions to entertain yourself then stay away from this.The bottom line and ""theory"" of this movie is symbolized in all the excerpts from ""Blob"" with a certain Steve McQueen. Here is a guy who evidently took himself serious and played some tough guys in his days.YET: Steve McQueen was in ""Blob""... CONCLUSION: Don't take yourself so serious, people. Whether it's comedy or drama or action: it doesn't take 200 mio. dollars to be entertained.",1
7,"The reviews for this movie here are mainly positive. And it's no surprise. This is a very, Very strong first movie. In fact, it looks almost exactly like the more famous Landis movies down to the lighting and editing. It does have some silly stuff in it, and there are scenes to make the picture longer. But the movie never feels constricted by its low budget, it successfully pokes fun at it. Landis is great as the titular ape and Rick Baker's done a great job on the mask - it even allowed Landis to emote. Eric Roberts' wife plays a blind girl who befriends Schlock thinking he's a dog, but soon she regains her sight and then!... Schlock's really funny, it looks like it's someone's first movie only for the first 15 minutes, and then it becomes big and quite enjoyable.",1
7,"This is a pretty simple review to write, if you like Monty python stuff, you'll like this movie. It's very surreal, but in the best way possible. I thought it was pretty funny, while not all of the jokes stuck, but you could easily say the same thing about Monty python. Give this gorilla film a chance if you like bizarre comedies!",1
5,"This is a truly bad film in almost every conceivable way: Poorly scripted, amateurishly acted, badly directed, and incompetently edited, but is saved by director Landis himself: His largely improvised performance in Rick Baker's excellent ""monkey suit"" for most of the second half of the film is laugh-out-loud funny in places, truly saving an otherwise forgettable film.Sadly, despite Mr. Landis's encyclopedic knowledge of early cinema, many opportunities to parody or pay homage to other monster movies are missed. For example, the sequence where Schlock is feeding the ducks at the pond is just asking for a reference to the ""flower"" scene from James Whale's ""Frankenstein"". (Or is this reference enough? Hmm.) Other similar opportunities are missed throughout.",-1
10,"This movie did something to me, something subversive. (I can't remember what, exactly, but it was really something.) It was like lighting a bottle rocket, which whooshed up into the air and exploded my sense of humor into a million tiny bits of laughter. To this day, I cannot even THINK of this movie without laughing out loud. Even now, lo these many decades later, just watching the trailer still sends me into full-on crack-up. Looking back, I can clearly see how this film served as a kind of weird initiation that ultimately pointed me in the direction of The Church of the SubGenius. Praise Bob! (and John Landis also...)Can anybody stop it?",1
10,"Everyone who wants or has to educate himself will not get around this film.
It doesn't matter whether it's about bananas or the erotic aura of big breasts, the movie never uses cheap humoristic clichés.The illustrated story is to be seen as the basis of all that is funny and desirable about the human race, that should imitate us first of all an artificial intelligent. Now I could write watch this movie and your life will improve in quality of life, but I'm honest most people are just too forgetful to have some of the great philosophical insights in the long run.It can also be assumed that the people who rate this movie worse than 10 stars either have to be stupid complete idiots or their sense of humoristic activities has been extracted from them beforehand. So I remain respectfully,
her T.T. from the German Ministry of Popular Humor",1
6,"I love this movie. I watched it when I was about 12 and laughed so hard my sides hurt. A movie about a blind girl who is the object of the 'Missing link's' affection and the chaos that ensues. (Pity about the ending... very King Kong) I have to mention some of my favourite parts in this movie, just to indulge myself and bore those who haven't seen it yet.The reporter's face when the old scientist explains terms that contain 'homo-' in them, is classically hilarious and something I will never forget, despite the fact that I saw this movie so long ago.The part when the crowd are standing around the hole where Schlock is believed to be, and Schlock himself joins them all out of curiosity. One lady looks at him and exclaims: ""Why don't you get a hair cut? Why don't you get a job?"" HILARIOUS!! - The part where Schlock fetches the stick for the blind girl, only to watch her throw it away again. This concept escapes Schlock's logic and he keeps fetching the stick every time she throws it away, wondering what the point is.A big thank you to Landis for starting off my Movie education with such comedy. It's completely stupid and painful to watch! I LOVED IT!!",1
10,"*WARNING: MORE THAN ANY OTHER MOVIE THAT COMES TO MIND, THIS IS A TRUE CULT MOVIE! WATCHING IT COULD CAUSE DANGEROUS NEW THOUGHTS IN YOUR HEAD* DO you understand the above warning? If you don't get that statement, or don't like what it implies, you will HATE this movie. I sat alone in a theatre in a rotten, crummy little one-horse town in the Midwest and saw this movie in 1973. I laughed harder that night than I have since.The film violates every possible rule of good taste, all conceivable social norms, and is terrifically long on puns and non-sequiturs. It is a positive wealth of sight gags. this is not highbrow movie by any stretch of the imagination, but low comedy was one thing in the 70's and something less now: it is probably ""too hip for the room"" at the dawn of the 21st century.Think of this movie as a knowing ""wink"" at the audience. It says, ""we're going to play a game here--I'm going to pretend to be a movie, and you're going to pretend to be an audience...all you have to do as the audience is to get the joke."" ""Schlock"" is a satire of a lost genre of horror films: the ""caveman"" movie (specifically it is a first rate send up of one of the classic bad movies of all time: ""Trog"").If you watch bad movies for their unintentional comedy, if you think Mel Brook's first six movies are funny, then you're going to love this. On the other hand, if you think that the three funniest movies ever made were ""Scary Movie I,"" ""Scary Movie II,"" and ""Not Another Teen Movie,"" then avoid this at all costs.",1
10,"Great movie for those who like slap stick stupid movies. i.e. Benny Hill, Airplane, etc...... It has moments you'll never forget. I liked seeing it because it gives me the history on John Landis when I watch his films. See you next Wednesday!",1
8,"Renegade detectives Ross and Wilson decide to take down major drug kingpin Blasi. Writer/director Mitch Brown keeps the entertaining story moving along at a speedy clip, maintains a hard cynical tone throughout, stages the exciting car chases and shoot outs with flair and skill, and makes nice use out of such practical locations as an open field, a train yard, and a parking garage. Richard C. Watt and Chuck Russell are appropriately scruffy as the maverick cops on the case while Frank Himes makes for a pleasingly nasty villain. The aerial photography provides an impressive sense of scope. Considering that this movie was made for a modest fifteen thousand dollars, it's competently put together and manages to milk a lot of production value with its minimal resources. A cool little flick.",1
7,"Surely one of the most obscure, low-budget films to receive a major label home video release (thanks, Sony), it's not even clear what the original title of this film was. There's a disclaimer in front of the feature which indicates that the title has been changed for the video release, but the title card for the film consists of the single word 'Shot'. So was this released to theatres as Shot, or as something else all together? We're not likely to find out any time soon. Death Shot starts off with a low rent drug transaction gone bad: one gang of hairy thugs accuses another gang of shorting them $200 (!) and end up getting caps popped in their collective asses. The jaunty blues-funk score of Area Code 615 then commences, supplying us with a clue of where this feature might have been shot: most likely Tennessee, from whence the band sprang in the late 1960s. Wherever it is, it looks COLD, with snow either falling or on the ground throughout the entire film. There's also lots of violence, as a pair of hairy, not-by-the-books cops chase after the motley drug lords who spend their time hanging out at the Mr. Quick fast food establishment when they're not pushing dope on the local kids. It all adds up to a gritty good time for admirers of regional cinema and fast-paced crime dramas. I'd love to learn more about this feature, but I suspect the DVD commentary is still pretty far in the future. Postscript: according to the credit crawl, Death Shot was filmed in East Central Illinois.",1
8,"Make no mistake that this was an independent production made and financed by a group of college film students shot in and around the campus town of Champagne, Illinois.

I've shown it to a couple friends, we still quote it.",1
8,"Of all the crummy movies I've seen in my lifetime, I was sure that even IMDb might have missed this one, but, lo and behold......I am a huge fan of substandard film, mostly in the action and horror genres, and I first saw 'Death Shot' (or simply 'SHOT' in the actual credits) back in 1987 very early into my quest for crappy film. My friend and I just couldn't resist the cheesy artwork on the box depicting some dirt-bag with a headband and an assault rifle. The date on the box said 1987, so we figured we'd just stumbled across another direct-to-home-video, shot-on-home-video, laughable piece of junk..... In reality, it turned out to be much worse. This film was shot in 1973 and then dug out of a cellar somewhere and re-hashed for the home video market of the 1980s. The box artwork I mentioned didn't even depict an actual character in the movie, and not once was an assault rifle fired or even brandished for that matter. In fact, the characters pretty much fire snub-nosed revolvers that 'snap' suspiciously like caps....It is really impossible to describe an actual plot. For the most part, scenes toggle between a group of greasy looking 'criminals'-- who are supposed to be bad-ass drug dealers, but pretty much behave like schoolyard bullies -- and the equally grubby cop duo who try to track down the criminals while engaging in some questionable behavior of their own (i.e. sleeping with junkies, shooting suspects, getting drunk...) Other random characters come and go during the film with little or no explanation as to who they are or how they tie in to the events. There are a few woefully done action sequences that should induce some laughter, but it's the dialogue that'll ultimately have you rolling. A couple of scenes that really stand out: 1) The 'head' bad dude (I don't recall his name) wanders into a Mr. Quick restaurant to confront a client who is delinquent on some payments, then intimidates the Peter Frampton wannabe by stomping on his watch and tearing up a picture of his girlfriend, and then lets out a clichéd 'bad guy' laugh after breaking a wine bottle over the dude's head. 2) Shortly before the scene above, the three baddies bump into some dweeb named Mickey and allow him to join their gang after they make fun of his clothes and tear his frisbee in half. The verbal exchanges in this scene are so preposterous they have to be seen and heard to be believed. 3) The bad guys threaten to throw one of their pushers off of a rooftop because he supposedly short-changed them. Of course, the guy accidentally falls off the roof (one of the worst looking dummy falls in history), and one of the bad dudes remarks about how cool it was to see him splatter.There are several other rotten scenes to enjoy, but the movie does have a number of slow spots, and the overall dreary atmosphere and bad sound might make it hard for some people to sit through. But for fans of fetid film like myself, this is a gem. The only problem now is that it may be nearly impossible to find, as I'm sure this one was ultimately discarded from most stores that carried it once DVDs took over as the mainstream format, and I highly doubt 'SHOT' will be on DVD anytime soon....1.5 out of 10 for 'film' buffs.8 out of 10 for lovers of crapola.",1
6,"Friends and I stumbled onto this title because we A) heard it was shot at the University of Illinois B)Was just awful C)had lots of helicopter shots and needless violence. Delivery- yes. As far as I can tell, all shooting was on the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign campus, as we could spot many public places in the scenes which have changed dramatically. Notably the chase in the parking garage, walking on a bridge which are the Presidential Towers (a local student housing), and the drug lord's mansion (the Japan House, a Japanese Cultural Center). For the most parts, it's a surprisingly good (at keeping suspense) for a low budget. Tire squeals on dirt, and fighting over $200 just adds to the fun. I specifically got the feeling that a large amount of the budget was supplied to destroy a car and use a helicopter, which many of the scenes reflect. If you have a case of beer and sadistic disposition- go for it.",1
7,"Zombies, brain experiments, and cannibals all in one film! A low budget, plenty of inept special effects, lousy acting and locations...these factors combine to make ZOMBIE HOLOCAUST one of those so-bad-it's-good films. If you have a sense of humour like me, you'll love it, because there are a lot of things to laugh at, such as the jesting students in the morgue. One joke is along the lines of ""I thought you might have mutilated the corpse, after all you did say that you needed a hand with your studies."" It's so pathetic that you have to laugh at it because of the sheer cheesiness and absurdity. Lots of other immortal dialogue abounds in the film, that's just a sample.Now, ZOMBIE HOLOCAUST is a truly bad film. Viewers more acquainted with glossy American dramas with high budgets and lavish sets will be disappointed by the badness of it. As the film is Italian, the voices are all badly dubbed, which can be something of a hindrance. But to lovers of the bad film, there's a lot to savour. Firstly, the cast; Ian McCulloch lends wooden charm as the lead, complete with an ill-fitting wig; Alexandra Delli Colli is there for glamour purposes alone, as she's certainly no actress, and Donald O'Brien (who had a life in flicks such as this) is excellent as the over-the-top villain of the piece.The cannibals run around and shout in high pitched voices. They may not be the most convincing of actors, but they soon get down to a lot of gut ripping and eyeball popping to 'entertain' the viewer. The zombies, who actually don't eat any people in this film for a change, walk around and breathe heavily like an asthmatic Darth Vader. Sometimes they run with knives, too. They're pretty unpredictable. The comedy brain experiment ending is so unconvincing and badly acted that you just have to love it. Lots of gore, a scene of a naked girl being painted by natives, and hilarious dialogue make this one a very enjoyable watch. Okay so it didn't win any awards, but it's fun, and that's what counts in my book. I can think of films with budgets hundreds of times higher which I hated...",1

The lead female character is a complete mess with her doctorate in medicine and also in anthropology, performed by the sexy Alexandra Delli Colli that is shot naked most of the time without any reason. The lead male character is performed by the ham actor Ian McCulloch that makes the story hilarious with his ridiculous acting.

But then, you won't need me to tell you to watch this (or not). This is decently made, good effects for the budget they had (and considering that weird red ""blood"" they used back in the day).The title is quite sensational and obviously is meant to offend.

While slinky blonde distaff lead Alexandra Delli Colli's hopelessly acting leaves plenty to be desired, she nonetheless compensates for her woeful thespic abilities by showing off her fine sender figure with pleasing regularity. Fetching brunette Sherry Buchanan brings a winningly perky charm to her role as pesky reporter Susan Kelly. The cruddy dubbing, plodding pace, priceless tin-eared dialogue (""I could easily kill you now, but I'm determined to have your brain!""), and meandering nonsensical narrative all give this fabulously fetid flick a certain endearingly ramshackle charm. The make-up f/x are rather crude, but still deliver the gory goods by the tasty truckload (said gore includes throat slashings, dismemberment, graphic gut munching, and grisly brain transplant surgery).

7,"If, like me, you enjoy Italian zombie movies, but are also partial to the occasional cannibal flick, then Zombie Holocaust (AKA Dr. Butcher M.D.) is a real treat, for it not only features the walking dead, but a whole load of gut munching natives too. And for good measure, you also get a mad doctor!Director Marino Girolami hedges his bets somewhat with this mish-mash of genres, but the result is a fun-packed gore-fest that is guaranteed to put a smile on the face of any fan of trashy horror. Whilst it is true that the story makes little sensea team from the New York Dept. of Health(!) travel to a remote island and encounter all manner of dangersthe high level of violence and the film's general technical shoddiness make Zombie Holocaust unmissable.Ian McCulloch plays Dr. Peter Chandler, the leader of the expedition to the mysterious island of Keto. It is here that he and his fellow travellers hope to discover the reasons behind a spate of recent cannibalistic attacks in the Big Apple. What they do find, however, is a bloodthirsty surgeon who is attempting all manner of dodgy operations on live victims, creating zombies in the process. Like I said, the story is complete hogwash, but great fun.Alexandra Delli Colli plays Lori, a yummy anthropologist who accompanies Peter on his trip. Also along for the ride is Susan, a journalist, her boyfriend George, their guide Molotto and some porters. Delli Colli provides the necessary T&A (she's a game girl and gets buck naked a few times), whilst the others are merely there to be eaten or operated on.Gore highlights include quite a few disembowellings, a nifty eye gouging, a messy zombie/propeller interface, some scalpings and an assortment of bloody corpses. The effects are bargain basement quality, but extremely bloody.Zombie Holocaust is great cheesy entertainment and should be a must see for all fans of 70s and 80s Italian horror (and look out for some unintentionally hilarious momentscheck IMDb's goofs for details).",1
8,"Also known as Zombi Holocaust, the American version of this film features a sequence from an unfinished film called Tales That'll Tear Your Heart Out, a different music score and some edits for pacing. It's also got a much better title: Doctor Butcher, M.D. (Medical Deviate). And let me warn you right here and now. This is a film that takes no prisoners. It's everything horrible about horror films, the kind of Satanic panic nightmare that your clergyman warned you about. It is vile, reprehensible garbage. And it's entertaining as hell.New York City in the late 70's is a bad place to be. Even in the hospitals, a maniac is caught cutting off body parts and escaping with them. All the higher ups want to keep the story out of the paper, but morgue assistant and anthropology exert Lori (Alexandra Delli Colli, New York Ripper - imagine having those two movies on your IMDB history!) grew up in the Moluccan islands, where the cannibal came from. Let's forget what a coincidence this is and just savor the madness that is to follow. As soon as she learns the truth, a journalist named Susan (Sherry Buchanan, Escape from Galaxy 3, Tentacles) breaks into her place. And right after she kicks her out, her ceremonial dagger gets stolen! How could this happen!? And how coincidental - again - that a killer who works in the same hospital as Lori would steal it, get caught and give chase before falling to his death from a rooftop (and magically turn into a mannequin before crashing to the pavement)?Maybe Lori's hospital isn't that unique because this is happening all over town, all with hospital workers baring the same tattoo. Dr. Pete Chandler (Ian McCulloch, Zombi, Contamination), Lori's anthropologist friend, suggest that she join him and his friend Pete on a trip to the islands. And oh yeah - Pete's girlfriend is Susan, in another coincidence. God only plays dice in Italian zombie films.Once they arrive, they meet Dr. Obrero (Donald O'Brien, Ghosthouse, Emanuelle and the Last Cannibals), who warns them that the natives are more like wild animals and will not take kindly to strangers. To prove his point, one of them leaves a maggot-ridden severed head in Lori's room. At this point, any sane person would just go home. But then, we would not have a movie. Obrero sends Moloko, his assistant along with them on their journey. Is it weird that he has the same name as the island?Within minutes of the running time of the film, all of the party's guides and porters are dead, other than Moloko. Soon, George and Susan are raw meat and the rest of the party seem like they are soon to be dinner, too. That's when zombies attack, sending the cannibals off into the jungle. And strangely, Dr. Obrero gets to them faster than they expected with help.Let me spoil this one for you - Dr. Obrero is Dr. Butcher. He got the natives to rediscover their cannibal ways and they provide him with the raw material that he needs to create his zombies. He uses them for experiments, moving science forward as he works on the same set as Fulci's Zombi. He's a decent fellow, though. He lets the natives keep the scalps, after all.After killing a zombie with a boat motor, Chandler breaks into the doctor's office, where he is transplanting Susan's brain, who is bald because, you know, they took her scalp. Also, she's still alive. The doctor takes Chandler captive and Lori is taken by the cannibals, who the natives see as some kind of god. You know, blonde hair and white skin and all that. They paint her with flowers as if she were Goldie Hawn on Laugh-In and she lies in a body shape on the altar that looks like the tattoos we saw earlier. Somehow, again through total coincidence, she fits perfectly into the impression.Lori uses her power over the cannibals to attack the doctor and his zombies, freeing Chandler and allowing them to head back to civilization. Where, you know, they'll both get over this with no issues at all.The ad campaign for this film, such as the stolen image of Salvador Dali and lurid copy on the poster, push this movie into a transgressive art experience. And that's before the Butchermobile hit the road. A rented truck with posters plastered on every side that dripped blood, it cruised the streets of downtown New York City promising that Dr. Butcher, M.D. could deliver an experience that other lesser films could not.You can learn all of this and more with Severin's jam-packed blu ray release. From interviews with Aquarius Releasing's Terry Levene, the men who drove the Butchermobile, Ian McCulloch and Sherry Buchanan to a tour of today's Times Square, you could almost make the case that the extras are worth a release of their own. Throw in two versions of the film - both the American cut and the original Zombie Holocaust Italian version - and you have a release that simply cannot be beat.If you ever watched a movie and wondered, ""I wish that people got eaten and torn to bits every twenty seconds while loony synth music played,"" I have some good news for you. Your horrifying prayers will be answered by this movie.",1
7,"Zombi Holocaust is one of the biggest pleasant surprises I purchased in a long time. And that's a really positive thing to say because you probably know this kind of horror films...Fully made and produced in Italy in the early 80's, these movies have like a dozen alternate titles and versions. Tons of similar movies like this were made during this decade but most of them only seem promising but disappoint in the end. Zombi Holocaust doesn't !! This movie is an extremely enjoyable mixture of all kind of interesting and nasty horror topics. Okay, the movie is called ""Zombi"" Holocaust and there ARE a few zombies to detect, but Zombie Holocaust is sooooo much more than that !!Actually, the plot of Zombie Holocaust is about a mad scientist / doctor who uses a tribe of cannibals to perform medical experiments on. Due to those experiments, the aborigines become zombies. Now, in that simple plot summary, we've had ZOMBIES, CANNIBALS and freakin' MAD DOCTORS !!! I don't know about you, but to me that already sounds like every fan's dream. And I can assure you that - if you have the privilege to watch the fully uncut version like I did - you'll have a true gorefest !! The level of sickness and utterly nasty scenes is very extreme and it even surpasses the work of undeniable masters in the field like Lucio Fulci and Ruggero Deodato in certain sequences. Zombie Holocaust contains a gruesome autopsy, many throats are being slit, faces and guts are being ripped off/out etc etc...the gore highlights really are numberless. If I have to pick one, I'd say the scene where a zombi is hacked up for barbeque by a propeller !! Classic need-to-see stuff for horror fans !!!Furthermore, the plot contains many, many holes and the acting is abominable. Even though O'Brien shows a lot of potential as the freaky doctor, he's given too less screentime to impress you enough. And even though Alexandra Delli Colli has a gorgeous body, ( and she proves that multiple times by showing it ) she isn't much of a talented actress. But seriously...who cares about all these things ? Besides, bad acting is necessary for this kind of early 80's horror...it adds a lot more charm to the production. Zombi Holocaust is just a magnificent splatter movie that comes with my highest possible recommendation. I've only got to known this movie recently because of all the confusing aka's. It was listed as ""Zombie3"" in my local videostore and as ""Zombie Holocaust"" in another. But there are just way to many Italian movies called like that to let it bother you. Seek this one and enjoy it !!",1
6,"Cult following fare from director Marino Girolami that begins with strange body parts missing from corpses in a teaching hospital in New York City. This activity is believed to be tied to a cannibal cult that is faithful to Kito, a god of cannibalism. This all leads to an expedition of doctors, students and reporters to a remote island in the Pacific. A trail of pilfered corpses lead to a jungle laboratory of the mad Doctor Obrero(Donald O'Brien), who is conducting bizarre and tortuous experiments on living and dead specimens. As if someone really desires to add another hundred years to their life expectancy. Some brutal and graphic scenes for the zombie lover. Predictable, but fun. The cast includes: Ian McCulloch, Alexandra Delli Colli, Peter O'Neal, Sherry Buchanan and Franco Ukmar.",1
7,"Corpses in an NYC hospital are being mutilated, and it's discovered that a member of the staff is responsible. These actions are linked to other crimes, and the perpetrators are found to have originated from an East Indies island. A doctor (Ian McCulloch), his associate (Peter O'Neal), an anthropologist (Alexandra Delli Colli), and a reporter (Sherry Buchanan) travel to this area to figure out the whole story, which doesn't just involve cannibalism, but ""zombies"" as well, being controlled by a fanatic doctor (Donald O'Brien) determined to perform revolutionary surgery.Comparisons to Lucio Fulcis' ""Zombi 2"" are apt, what with the basic story being so similar, and this doesn't bring too much to the party other than the canny idea of combining an Italian zombie movie with an Italian cannibal movie. This movie even has *two* of the same actors from ""Zombi 2"", the always take charge, always kick ass McCulloch, who's as engaging a hero as before, and Dakar, playing a native guide. The location shooting adds the necessary atmosphere, and there is an amusing level of ""what the Hell is going on?"" mystery to the proceedings, although it shouldn't be too hard for the average viewer to figure that out. The production design is by Walter Patriarca, who also appears on screen as Dr. Drydock; as another connection to ""Zombi 2"", he was the costume designer on that show. Luscious ladies Delli Colli and Buchanan add all the eye candy we could want, with blonde Delli Colli actually going full frontal as well. Buchanan is especially fun in her performance as the stereotypically pushy reporter. McCulloch, not surprisingly, is a total hoot, especially when he improvises by dispatching a zombie with an outboard motor to the face! O'Brien (who's dubbed by Edward Mannix) is fun, too, having just the right look for our mad doctor / butcher. The zombies are ugly suckers with something of a resemblance to the beings in ""Burial Ground"" (they also announce their presence with a creepy breathing sound), and the gore is excellent: it's right in your face and stays there.All of these elements add up to okay if not truly remarkable viewing. As has been said, the film does, on the whole, feel rather familiar. But it's still acceptable entertainment for loyal devotees of this kind of thing.Seven out of 10.",1
7,"Zombi Holocaust starts in New York as it is revealed that an orderly at a hospital has been eating various parts of the autopsy cadavers like hands & hearts. When eventually unmasked he commits suicide by jumping out of a window, upon inspection of his body nurse & anthropologist Lori Ridgeway (Alexandra Delli Colli as Alexandra Cole) notices a tattoo on his chest which she recognises as an ancient symbol of some god that some tribe or other worship somewhere on an island called Keto. Lori instantly becomes an expert & together with Dr. Peter Chandler (Ian McCulloch) his assistant George Harper (Peter O'Neal) & his girlfriend a reporter named Susan Kelly (Sherry Buchanan) decide to set off to the island of Keto & see what they can see. Chandler has a contact on the mainland, Dr. Obrero (Donald O'Brien) who gives them a guide named Moloto (Dakkar) & a couple of men. After a minor incident where a rotten decapitated head covered in maggots is left in Lori's bed they travel to the island in high spirits. Once on Keto things take a turn for the worse as they encounter deadly booby traps, flesh eating cannibals, zombies, sacrificial rituals & bizarre brain transplanting experiments...This Italian production was directed by Marino Girolami as Frank Martin & I thought Zombi Holocaust was reasonable entertainment as long as you don't take it too seriously & have the stomach for this sort of Euro gore/exploitation film. The script by co-producer Fabrizio De Angelis, assistant director Romano Scandariato & Walter Patriarca who also acted as production designer & has a small role in the film as Professor Strafford moves along at a nice pace but can't quite decide what it wants to be. Part jungle adventure, part cannibal, part zombie & part mad scientist film all rolled into one implausible scenario! But then again what did you expect? Deep meaning, a life changing emotional roller-coaster, Oscar worthy performances or perhaps a film that asks profound questions about modern society & where we are headed? Nah, didn't think so! It's all rather silly but at the same time good fun if your in the right mood & like this sort of stuff, I also felt the ending was a little rushed almost as if director Girolami was told to wrap it up as quickly as he could. The zombie elements are virtually none existent as we get about four during the whole film & the first one doesn't turn up until the 50 odd minute mark, there are more cannibals than zombies. In fact when you think about the title Zombi Holocaust it rips-off the two most famous Italian films it's basically trying to replicate, Ruggero Deodato's infamous Cannibal Holocaust (1980) & Lucio Fulci's equally infamous Zombi 2 (1979). In fact it actually use a bit of footage from Zombi 2, looks like it's set on exactly the same island, has two of the stars more or less play identical characters here & I thought that large white missionary building at the end was very familiar... Technically Zombi Holocaust is decent enough, cinematography, direction, editing, special effects & music are adequate while not exactly outstanding. The one area where Zombi Holocaust distinguishes itself is with it's gory set pieces, there are sawn off hands, cut out hearts, sliced open chests, poked out eyes, hungry cannibals cutting stomachs open & feasting on peoples intestines, bad for your health spiked booby traps, a decapitated head, a machete in someones head, brain operations, scalping's, a boat propeller used to obliterate a zombies face, some mutilated corpses with guts hanging out everywhere & a couple of gory slit throats. While not always convincing there's enough of the red stuff flying around to keep most gore hounds happy. Delli Colli takes all her clothes off at various strategic points as well so there's plenty of nudity when there's no blood. The acting is mixed, McCulloch makes for a likable hero & O'Brien for a great villain but Delli Colli is awful, except for taking all her clothes off obviously. Zombi Holocaust is good undemanding entertainment, I liked it but it can't really match the best Italian horror but it's head & shoulders above the worst. Definitely worth a watch especially if your a Euro horror fan. Also known as Doctor Butcher M.D. which is a slightly different cut of the film & is quite a cool sounding title.",1
5,"Ian McCulloch (Zombi) and Italian beauty Alexandra Delli Colli (in the recommended, but not seen yet, New York Ripper) travel to a cannibal island to find out what is happening in New York.If you like cannibal gore, then there is plenty of that. The zombies, created by the mad scientist, Donald O'Brien, don't really play much of a role until the end. There is one who gets his brains scrambled with an outboard motor earlier - cool! The one thing I cannot figure is how Alexandra (who is definitely a natural blonde) managed to get off the sacrificial table just as the dagger was about to be plunged into her and lead the cannibals to destroy the zombies. It just happened - no explanation - you have to use your imagination.",-1
4,"A hospital assistant in New York City is caught cutting out the heart of a cadaver and trying to eat it. Rather than being captured alive he leaps out of the high-rise building to his death, leaving only a small clue as to where he is from. Because this isn't an isolated incident, an attractive micro-biologist by the name of ""Lori Ridgeway"" (Alexandra Delli Colli) agrees to go with an expedition to the isolated island in the East Indies to investigate this issue further. Once there the expedition encounters a tribe of cannibals who seek to kill and devour them. They also encounter zombies who want to do the same thing. At any rate, rather than divulging the entire story I will just say that this film isn't the best zombie film ever made. But for that matter, it isn't the worst zombie film ever made either. Although it certainly had enough blood to satisfy most gore-hounds, it seemed to be lacking in suspense which gave a lackluster quality to everything. Likewise, the plot was a bit convoluted and the acting was below average too. As a matter of fact, about the only thing this film had going for it was the presence of Alexandra Delli Colli in various states of undress. No doubt that was sensational for its time (1980) but it just wasn't enough to elevate this film to an average rating in my opinion. In short, I recommend this film for die-hard zombie fans only.",-1
4,"Put them together and you get a completely mindless movie! Yes, the title of this film is completely misleading (the Zombie Holocaust one) as when I hear it, I imagine hordes of zombies rampaging the countryside. Instead, what we mainly get is a cannibal horror film fused together with a mad doctor film with a dash of zombies in it for taste. It shares a lot of similarities to Lucio Fulci's Zombie movie too as it features Ian McCulloch and another actor from that film and it appears to be on the exact same island! When they first drive to the one doctor's house they go down a street and it looks exactly like a scene out of Zombie, heck the donkey may have even been in Zombie. They depart in terms of plot; however, as this one does not focus on the zombie aspect. Well, it does not really focus on anything, as nothing anyone in this film does makes much sense. I think they just tried to fuse to many sub genres together without a complete script or something.The story of this one is the weakest element of the film, because at times it almost seems like there is none. There are mutilations in a hospital in New York and it is soon learned that it is the work of a cannibal. Other cannibals turn up here and there because somehow they can just get jobs at hospitals. A group of four people travel to an island for reasons that are really no one's business, because them going makes absolutely no sense. They meet a doctor who provides them with some yummy looking lemonade and then they are off to another island where the cannibals live. The group which now includes three very expendable helpers and another dude soon find themselves under assail from the cannibals who get scared by zombies going ""Ah"" and nearly everyone is killed, but the two survivors decide to try and figure out the mystery even though it literally accomplishes nothing.The film moves at a rather fast pace and it features some good Italian splatter and some good nudity too. That makes the film at least watchable, but the plot is so horrendously bad that I just cannot score it any higher. Some of the effects are rather horrible too, as at one point one of the cannibals is caught in New York and he proceeds to jump out a window. It is obviously a mannequin and when it impacts the ground, its arm pops off! I realize they may not want to redo the scene, but they could have at least jump cut and edited that part out! The mad doctor is the only person who seems to know what he is doing, but making a race of ineffective zombies seems kind of a waste of time. Just too much bad in this one to overcome even with the nice gore and very hot blond.So this film is a combination film, but I think they just tried to do too much. At times it is a cannibal film, at other a mad doctor and then a bit of zombies in there for effect. Heck, the scenes where the blond undress could be considered soft core porn because the music is right out of one! They just tried to do much, and as I have said, I just do not think they had fully completed script to go along with it all. Though another interesting aspect of the film is its similarities to Zombie; however, that one is the superior film as it makes a bit more sense why things are happening and why they go to the island. Here, it just makes no sense at all.",-1
6,"Zombi 2 saw Lucio Fulci deliver a film that took huge influence from George Romero's zombie masterpiece Dawn of the Dead (even though the great horror director claims to have been influenced by Jacques Tourneur), and Zombi Holocaust in turn takes influence from Fulci's Zombi 2. Zombi Holocaust is more than just a simple rip-off, however, as prolific director Marino Girolami finds time to implement other horror themes such as cannibal tribes and mad scientists into the plot. The film takes place in the same location as Fulci's zombie flick, and sees the undead eating people on a Caribbean island. This film very much fits into the Italian zombie sub-genre, with such treats as bad acting, worse dubbing, a rather absurd plot line and plenty of blood and guts making it into the finished product. The plot sees a mad scientist on a tropical island experimenting with life and death and ending up turning a number of the locals into zombies. We follow an expeditionary group who land on the island as they come face to face with the zombies and cannibals that live there.If you're a fan of blood and guts, you're in the right movie. The gore is mostly comical, but it works due to the fact that it's so massively over the top. Scenes that see a zombie have its face mashed by a propeller, numerous slit throats and several sequences that see the living being eaten offer a gory treat for the horror fan. The fact that this is so much like Zombi 2 put me off a little, however, as it really does feel like you're watching a follow up rather than a supposedly original zombie film. Saying that, this film would have made a far better follow up than Fulci's own Zombi sequel. The atmosphere is well done, as the setting gives the piece an element of mystery that comes part and parcel with a lot of the Italian cannibal films. The zombie make-up is suitably disgusting and a lot of the monsters really do look like they haven't been among the living for some time. Interestingly, the central roles are taken up by Fulci collaborators Ian McCulloch (Zombi 2) and Alexandra Delli Colli (The New York Ripper), which seems quite fitting. Overall, I can't say that this is one of my favourite zombie films; but its decent enough entertainment, and there's definitely something here for zombie fans.",1
10,"Marino Girolami's ""Zombi Holocaust"" is one of my favourite Italian gore flicks.I simply adore this film.Of course the script is pretty idiotic,but there is plenty of extreme gore to satisfy fans of Italian zombie/cannibal cinema.There are actually only about six zombies throughout it.The majority of violence is dealt out by cannibals and doctors.Italian beauty Alexandra Delli Colli is incredibly sexy and has several nude scenes.The gore is pretty extreme-there is an autopsy scene near the beginning that is actually a bit disgusting and looks fairly real.The film is fast-paced and hugely enjoyable,so if you are a fan of Italian exploitation cinema give this one a look.Highly recommended.",1
5,"****SPOILERS**** It's when a number of patients, dead as well as alive, are mutilated and eaten by an orderly named Toran at a New York City hospital, who when caught ended up doing himself in, that it's suspected by staff member Dr. Lori Ridgeway, who and expert on cannibalism, that the person who's been doing these things is a die in the wool cannibal who's arrived on a students visa from the far off Caribbean island of Maluku! In trying to check thing out any more cannibals from entering the states an fact finding expedition to Maluku is organized with Lori in charge to find out if in fact a undiscovered race of cannibals still live in the island. Their soon confronted by Dr.Butcher and his trusted aid Molotto who are more then willing to help with Lori not realizing that the two are really really bad news. Dr. Butcher has been experimenting with the people on the island for years and turning them into walking dead Zombies in an insane effort to increase the lifespan of the human race.Dr. Butcher in trying to steer Lori and her party away from the island of Maluku , and keep the secret of his experiments hidden, has the opposite effect when they, by getting lost at sea, end up being there anyway! It's then when the cannibals come out in the open looking for human flesh and end up killing and eating almost all the members of Lori's expedition except for Lori and her boyfriend Dr. Peter Chandler. It's when a bunch of Zombies, looking like they were just dug up out of their graves, pop up and scare the cannibals away it becomes apparent that Dr. Butcher and Molloto have been secretly been creating them and even worse are planning to turn both Peter & Lori into Zombies themselves!****SPOILERS**** Blood splattering Zombie/Cannibal film that one has to have a strong stomach to be able to watch and sit through without a barf-bag available at hand. Ironically it's the cannibals who turn out to be the good guys by putting and end to Dr. Butcher and his aid Molotto's evil experiments. As if all the people that the cannibals killed and ate, on the island of Maluku as well as in NYC, was nothing more of a crime then picking their noses in public! It's just when Dr. Butcher was about to pick Peter's brain in came or crashed a bunch of hungry cannibals lead by non other then Lori, who convinced them she was on their side, putting an end to him Molotto, who was already did in by Peter, and his crazy experiments in what turned out to be a fiery holocaust: With only the Zombies being the ones holocaust-ed!",-1
6,"A classic zombie splatter fun spiced up with cannibals, boobs and a mad scientists work, Marino Girolami's ""Zombi Holocaust"" of 1980 is a true B-movie, pure exploitation, blood, and gore, everything the lover of bad taste craves for. On top you get these 70/80s synthie musicscore.
To all the critics, everyone who watches a movie called Zombi Holocaust from the 80s and expects a fine and elaborated story-line, big production and great movie art is a lost cause himself ;)",1
6,"I first saw this in the late 80s on a vhs. Revisited it recently. Found the film very shocking then due to the gore but aft revisiting it, found it to be boring cos almost for 34 mins nothing happens.
We have lots of nudity by Alexandra Delli Colli, who in her short career is noted for the kinky female from New York Ripper.
In this movie, there is nothing new except for the gore.
Even the plot is stale - A team of scientists travel to a remote island aft witnessing cannibalism in various city hospitals by immigrants from a particular island. On the island, the team is shocked to come across cannibals n zombies.
The make up effects of the zombies is lol. Jus plain human in torn, raggy clothes.
Till now, i haven't been able to fathom how can u pierce someone's belly by a bamboo.
In this movie, a female falls into a trapping pit laden with pointed sticks but survives.",1
6,"Doctor Butcher M.D. (1980) was a cheap remake of Zombie. Why would anybody want to remake a movie that was already out a year ago still boggles my mind after all of these years. Several key players from Zombie make appearances as well (even the main zombies are played by the same cast). Another cheesy entry in the Italian zombie sweepstakes. Unlike the others, this one is not as enjoyable or that entertaining on any level. I also saw Zombie Holocaust as well. It's the same wonderful film except it has all of the gore and goo that was edited from Doctor Butcher.For die hard Italian zombie fans only",1
8,"Another classic from the golden era of Italian splatter (1979-1981), Zombie Holocaust does what other movies from the same era does...that is rip-off a slightly more successful movie and make it on a much smaller budget. Works for me! Like Zombie Creeping Flesh, the Zombie Dead, etc etc we've got a rip-off of Fulci's Zombie Flesh Eaters, with the same lead character, and the same jeep! This time, instead of being a journalist, Ian McCulloch plays a hard line Environmental Health Officer (or something) out to discover why natives from some island or other are chowing down on folks at the local hospital. I've watched the film about a dozen times but I'm still hazy on whether he succeeds or not, but there's plenty of gore in the film so - who cares.Ian heads of for this island with Alexandra Della Colli as a companion. Now, this lady is definitely a better trade in for Tisa Farrow, as she seems to have trouble keeping clothes on. For the last fifteen minutes of the film she just gives up on them altogether and struts around in the buff. Plus, she's quite handy with a machete.This island is crawling with cannibals but luckily Ian's got plenty of sidekicks that get carved up in various ways, and although there are zombies this film is more of a showcase of cannibalistic set-pieces where the natives gut folks and eat them. The zombies are more like a kind of garnish, although one does get mashed up with a speedboat motor.There's also a mad doctor in there, played by Donald O'Brien in a lovely over the top manner. Once again I wasn't 100% clear on why he was doing what he was doing, or even what happened to him at the end, but the film was so insanely enjoyable I was beyond caring.Infinitely re-watchable due to the scores of mistakes in the film, and the gore, and the nudity, Zombie Holocaust is yet another great Italian movie set partially or wholly in New York, just like Zombie Flesh Eaters, Contamination, City of the Living Dead, Days of Hell, Eaten Alive, Cannibal Ferox, Inferno, New York Ripper, Bronx Warriors, 2019: After the Fall of New York, Manhattan Baby, and Bronx Warriors 2: escape from the Bronx. And part of House by the Cemetery. And a two minute flashback in Last Hunter.Etc.",1
7,"Once again I must play something of the contrarian. Most of the reviews for Ab Tak Chappan have been extremely positive. Mine is positive, but only slightly. A 7 out of 10 is equivalent to a ""C"" letter grade from me.It seems that a lot of the praise is rooted in two factors: One, that Ab Tak Chappan is more realistic than the typical Bollywood film, and two, that it is trying to do things differently.The first point I couldn't care less about. I'm not looking for realism in films, and so I do not score higher for a film that shows a story and characters closer to how I believe the real world to be--I'm a big fan of surrealism, fantasy, absurdism, and so on, although I do not dislike realist films merely for the fact that they're realist.For the second point, I agree that it is commendable to try to do things differently. However, I don't think ""originality"" versus formulaicism makes for a better or worse film in itself. A film can be ""original"" and poor, just like a film can be formulaic and excellent. What matters are how well the film does whatever it sets out to do and how enjoyable or aesthetically rewarding that is to the viewer.Ab Tak Chappan is based on the true story of a Mumbai cop named Daya Naik. Naik was an ""encounter specialist"". Encounter specialists, who could be said to be early instantiations of real world ""Judge Dredds"", are trained to operate like the criminals and gang members they pursue, and they're basically given a license to kill--effectively acting as policeman, judge, jury and executioner in a matter of moments. Ab Tak Chappan follows the story of Sadhu Agashe (Nana Patekar), the encounter specialist based on Naik. We see him at work, interacting with his fellow encounter specialists and engaging in violence. We see him at home, trying to live a normal life in his less-than-luxurious surroundings. We see him trying to adjust to a new ""commissioner"" halfway through the film. And we see his odd relationship with a notorious Indian gangster, Don Zameer Zafar (Prasad Purandhare).All of this has the potential to make a fabulous, gritty film. I agree that it's nice to forgo the typical Bollywood musical numbers and romances--not every film needs that stuff; Ab Tak Chappan producer Ram Gopal Varma is famous for leaving music and romances in the background or by the wayside in many films that he's directed or produced. Additionally, Ab Tak Chappan has some good performances--Patekar almost gives off a Death Wish (1974)-era Charles Bronson vibe. It also has admirable cinematography--the hand-held stuff near the beginning of the film was particularly effective, for example. It has a great score that mixes more of a moody Hollywood-sounding action/crime score with traditional Indian instruments and modalities. The violence is well done and gritty.There is also decent exploration of subtexts, including the morality of (having) encounter specialists, the idea of following orders, and so on. The encounter specialists are shown having to largely divorce themselves from ideas of right and wrong. More poignantly, the film questions the merit of blindly following orders. Parallels are drawn between the encounter specialists following orders and, say, members of a country's military, and we're shown what a corrupt situation this can lead to.But (you just knew there was a ""But"" coming, didn't you?) director Shimit Amin and his scriptwriters have created a story with far too many characters, far too much sprawl, and that moves a bit too slow. All of these problems may be due to Amin and crew looking at the Godfather films, which Ab Tak Chappan has some (at least superficial) resemblances to, although from a policeman's perspective.Most of the encounter specialists we do not get to know very well--these are shallowly drawn characters to say the least, except for Agashe and Jatin Shukla (Nakul Vaid). For one, Narayan, I didn't know who he was until at least halfway through the film. His name is mentioned a number of times, but I'd only get glimpses of him until the scene would change. Then everyone would change clothes by the time they appear again and I'd have to start all over figuring out who Narayan was.The same thing happened with Agashe's first commissioner. The film was already far into the new commissioner before I could figure out the relationships. It seems like there are new characters in every scene. We never learn the stories of most of them. While that might have some artistic merit in that the encounter specialists are mostly killing people they do not know anything about (because they're mostly doing so on orders), since we do not learn much about most of the encounter specialists, either, it's difficult to find characters to care about, and that doesn't exactly make for a gripping film.The primary villain is Zameer. But until about halfway through the film, there's no indication of this. He doesn't get much more screen time than the other villains parading through the film, and he's literally ""phoning his performance in""--he's in another location (Dubai), communicating only by telephone for the majority of the film. We don't actually see Zameer doing much. To an extent, the film depends on a couple ""twists"" that necessitate not showing Zameer doing a number of things, but we could see him do other things, and a lot of the other villains could have been left out.That would have tightened up the film a bit, making it more focused and about a half-hour shorter, both of which would have benefited its impact. This is not an action-packed film by any means. For at least the first 45 minutes or so, I found myself admiring Ab Tak Chappan's considerable style, but saying, ""Okay, get on with the story already"".",1
6,"A familiar cop story told interestingly.It's the story of Sadhu Agashe as an encounter specialist and when he encounters a loss and then becomes more cold blooded and from cop to fugitive becomes lethal. Written and directed well by Shimit Amin, a director who writes well and directs the same superbly, this was his debut and how? Taking a well treaded path and make it more interesting and exploring a few niche things. The plot isn't original but the taking is. The way the climax is held and even 5 minutes before that, I did not expect it to end so menancingly as it is done, I must applaud the director here. The cinematography is too very stereotypical and follows its predecessors like Satya and others. The art direction, the costumes and the background score are good and simple, background went a bit overboard at times yet its just there aptly.Now Sadhu Agashe is a character that was as said 'inspired' from real life encounter specialist Dayanak just that the whole plot is fictionalised to take us through an engaging ride. Sadhu Agashe and for that matter most cops here are shown as sensitive and humane, like the Commissioner of police asking Sadhu, ""how is your son's fractured hand?"". Not sure if police are so humane but I will give in to most of such eccentricities in a plot that is a cold blooded revenge act. It has got a psychological thing as Sadhu Agashe tells his story through the induction a new cop into his team. More psychological would have more it less accessible and more interesting though, I liked it still the way it stands out now. Had production values been enhanced this was for sure then been a better watchable film.I will go with 3/5 for a good movie that could have been so much more. Watch it for Nana Patekar nevertheless",1
9,"What worked:
The movie is a game changer by one of the underrated directors Shimit. It is a very well directed piece of art. This movie has a very well written screenplay and dialogues by Sandeep,maybe one of those movies with a great narrative. One of the reasons n this movie can be multiple times is the screenplay and direction. Another reason is Nana Patekar who has played a phenomenal role in the movie, making it one of his best performances. It's a well acted movie by the supporting casts with Mohan Agase and Yashpal Sharks being on top of the league. Background score was well done as well.It's also the time when Ram Gopal Verma was considered one of the leading filmmakers in a progressive and parallel cinema, making some great movies in Bollywood. This movie is one of those rare movies with amazing story and great execution by the whole team.
What did not work:
One thing that the filmmakers of today would notice is the cinematography and I think they could have amended some of the ways the movie was shot.
Final verdict: highly recommended",1
6,"Not having much interest in action movies and abhorring violence, I avoided this movie for a quite a few months after its release, but I constantly was hearing good things about it. I finally got the willpower to rent this movie, and I was delightfully surprised. This isn't your ordinary dose of dhishum-dhishum nor your typical ""underworld/taking a harsh look at reality"" flick. Ram Gopal Verma ensures the audience never has a chance to lose their attention, even for a split second. There's no background information, no detailed explanation of events, etc.--just a straight cut to the chase. One by one, each of the plot's events take place in rapid succession leaving the audience with plenty to ponder about. The climax is totally unexpected (as is most of the movie) and has wonderful dialogues. The strength of this movie is definitely its slick and powerful script. Nana Patekar gives a good performance.",1
6,"Nana Patekar, the ""Morgan Freeman"" of Indian Cinema, has given some great perfs. as a village head in ""Shakti"", a mute in ""Khamoshi"". No one with an eye for good acting can miss the brilliance of this performer. A good script,a good supporting cast like Revathi, Yashpal Sharma, a crisp editing and direction makes this movie a winner. There are some great scenes and dialog-like when he first meets Zameer and explains him the ""nuisance value,"" when he invites his subordinate for dinner and cooks ""Sambar"". The movie is dominated and sustained by Patekar, who takes you into the web of underworld-deceit,deception and corruption which may border on exxageration at some point but the outline to some extent is real life dilemma faced by the law enforcement. The word ""Encounter"" is a misnomer but it is accepted as most accept the word ""Bollywood"". Any movie that can hold your interest with one actor and a clever dialog is a good movie and coming from an established film House-it is even better.",1
10,"Breathtaking performance & an app-laudable achievement for Nana Patekar is Ab Tak Chappan.Shimit Amin brings to us the most definitive cop movie Indian Cinema has seen after a long time.The movie shares the relation between underworld & police on screen.As well as one man commitment to his job as well as to other things.Dialog Delivery of Nana Patekar is sensational.Rest of the casting is perfect.Finesse though i think is added by Prasad Purandhare as Zameer.His acting & his dialog delivery seriously collides with the brilliance of Nana.Superb performance by him.This movie has no songs so this gives a Hollywood kind of an atmosphere.Dialog delivery are stupendous.The ending & the last conversation of Inspector Sadhu Agashe & Zameer just makes your day.Totally amazing ending.Also to go along slight soundtrack like the voice of great Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan just adds that extra spice.There is no limit on what frequency i see this.Mostly when i have nothing to do,i switch on my DVD player just to see this movie.Definitive entertainment focusing on the nexus of police & underworld.",1
9,"NANA Sir, hats off to most of your films couldnt review everything..
But this is mind-blowing then later (part 2), not leaving comments there..You actually pushed hard into the character making us trust more on Mumbai Police (whatever department that is).Hats Off Sir.. Thanks for great work.",1
7,"Feels little old but the movie is actually good, Nana Patekar did great.",1
7,"Nana Patekar once again proves that he is the best actor working in Bombay without a doubt. His recent movies involved shouting his lines that does not bode well for the theater trained thespian. One wonders why he  is always not given his accolades during awards season.""Shakti-The Power"" was one of his flicks that was an utter disapointment along with Kohram (a missed oppurtunity to create screen magic with Amitabh Bachchan).But Patekar exudes a cool calm in this film playing a cop on a sort of social justice journey. Ridding the streets of Bombay of underworld dons in fake encounters, Patekars character takes control of the screen (and the viewers attention) and never lets go. The editing is tightly paced and there are no annoying songs to distract from the story.Along the same lines as the modern day cult classic ""Company"", the movie is well acted, directed and should have a long shelf life on DVD.
The final ten minutes that see Nana and the main villain talk at his offshore haven are bound to be part of Hindi cinema classics. Won't be dissapointed with this cops and robbers flick.",1
6,"This film based on the life of Mumbai Police Dept. Encounter Specialist Daya Naik and his band of mercenary cops, depicts the face offs between underworld dons and the CID (crime branch) plainclothes detectives, in which the latter have an upper hand with their direct-hit 'Shoot first, ask questions later' M.O.Sadhu Agashe's (Nana Patekar as Daya Naik) team goes about the business matter-of-factly, with tacit blessings of their masters, both political and police force. Sadhu has some scores to settle with an overseas don, who frequently phones in, tending his ops remotely and lending the cops grief. For reasons undisclosed, their rivalry continues unabated even after Sadhu's superior changes, a wanted gunman supposedly escapes from custody and Sadhu's own wife is killed in a revenge spree.Although a different film than the usual cop-criminal drama, it settles quickly into a dull, monotonous pace. Director Shimit Amin is unable to breathe life into the plot. Some of the textbook dialogs do not build up any intrigue. Even a five-year-old could figure out the climax as Sadhu holes up overseas to avenge his wife's murder.Nana Patekar's hard-hitting performance does salvage the movie to some extent. Daya Naik was well-known amongst crime-watchers both within and outside Mumbai, though the 'encounter business' has encountered serious opposition from politicians, civic activists and Human Rights groups, and has largely wound down.Just like instant baby cereal, this 'Instant Formula Flick' from RGV's factory spoon-feeds viewers using a patent format. Burrrp.",1
8,"Ab Tak Chhappan is a fictitious story surrounding a police department in Mumbai, India. Sadhu Agashe is a hard working, hard-edged cop heading up a plain clothed crime squad who makes a name for himself by killing dangerous criminals in staged police encounters rather than locking them up in prison. His loyal officers obey him without question but a rift forms when one of his officers, Imtiaz, becomes frustrated by Sadhu's high ranking status and is secretly competing with him for criminal kills and status. A new recruit is also pushed into the fraternity and Imtiaz is angry when Sadhu allows him to take the lead on his first case. Further change comes in the form of a new police commissioner who disapproves of Sadhu's tactics and everyone gets caught up in internal politics.I was surprised to see such a well directed action thriller coming from India. The camera work is excellent, the story is well told and the tension is high when the drama unfolds. The acting, pace and political subterfuge convinces the viewer that they are a fly on the wall witnessing the blood, sweat and tears from a close up and personal view and that the events are based on reality which is no doubt why we are told that it is not at the beginning of the film although it is likely that the director, Shimit Amin, has taken liberties with factual accounts. Nevertheless, Ab Tak Chhappan is an extremely polished piece of film-making.",1
8,"I think I have watched this movie a 100 of times, and still finds each and every scene so brilliant and realistic.",1
9,"wow ! This movie really hits the spot. It is so well made and balanced resulting in some quality entertainment. It is a true thriller. The movie is hilarious with its dialogues without being comical. It maintains its pace and there are no songs.The characters in the movie are another highlight, all were introduced well and will make you like them.Nana Patekar's performance is brilliant, his bad-ass police style and slang will make u fall in love. The way he takes people's cases is fun to see. Revathy is also adorable as his wife and i am glad she plays a woman of her age.Sadhu(Nana) is an encounter specialist who pursuing members of two rival gangs. He has a happy family life ,he is respected at work and he is not conflicted by what he does. He has jealous subordinates and dons trying to buy him out but all under control. Good amount of screen time is spent in showing this setting in style and introducing characters. life is good ,until......When u are done watching u will find yourself chuckling in the memory of the dialogues , recollecting the plot with amusement and humming the theme music.",1
8,"Crime drama genre is just like the chess game, if handled sensibly and very seriously. Its like you don't notice the motive or intention behind any move played by players ( in a movie, there are protagonist and antagonist) But as soon as the game comes towards climax, and protagonist checkmates the villain, you think of all those moves in sequence and how those moves trick the opponent to fall into his own trap. This game becomes more interesting and engaging when you get to know thinking behind every move played by the players. This is what director Shimit Amin achieved, with his brilliant direction, in this film by portraying each character and their role in main story which makes the movie one of the best crime drama movie.When you first see the poster and Nana Patekar in it with a tag line like ""If I have to think about what's right and what's wrong just like you guys (addressing to the readers), then Who will do it (the killing)"", u get the feeling that you will get to see something very interesting on the screen.The fearless encounter specialist, with very supportive commissioner of Mumbai Police Department to perform his duty without any restriction to clean the underworld and at the same time struggling to keep himself away from becoming a victim of jealousy of his own department member, faces difficulties while doing his job when a new commissioner is appointed. And execution of new orders from commissioner about an encounter leads to set a chain of incidents which create a gripping mind game.The depth in the character of Sadhu Agashe is wholeheartedly portrayed by legendary Nana Patekar with nuances and remarkable detailing. The dialogue delivery, body language and attitude of this actor is perfect for fearless Encounter Specialist. At the same time Nana Patekar portrays a loving family man, a protective father, frustrated cop. His facial expressions were outstanding while having a dialogue with his colleague about how cops are puppets of the politicians and system. All the other supporting actors play their role very well. Special mentions are Yashpal Sharma and Nakul Vaid.The character theme for Nana's character created by Salim-Sulaiman suits that character. The editing is tight and doesn't lose the hold and pace. Story and screenplay are awesome. Dialogues given to Nan's character are quirky and help build the character strongly. Dialoges between Nana and Don also add some humor in scenes. Cinematography is OK. Overall a good crime drama with magic touch of Nana Patekar is what Ab tak Chhapaan can be well described as. And yeah it is worth having along shelf life on DVDs.",1
10,"Satya was excellent.... Company was just as good but more polished, probably owing to the money earned from previous movies. Ab Tak Chappan however is even more entertaining. The dialogue is gritty, crude and at times hilarious. Nana Pataker shines yet again in a role that only he can fulfill with authority but the supporting cast are very talented. Direction is tight and the story evolves at a satisfying pace with a very dramtic climax. As a depiction of reality it may be over-dramatised but at the end of the day it's a movie so the balance is spot-on. I've ordered my DVD and can't wait to see it again at home. As a lover of these type of gangster flicks, this is very gratifying  and comes highly recommended for the refreshingly ""non-Yash Raj"" Bollywood gangster flick lovers out there.",1
8,"I almost stopped watching Hindi movies because of the mediocre quality and story lines. One exception for this is Ramgopal Verma movies. This is a nice movie with great performances from the star cast. This is must see movie for those who are sick of watching stupid dancing and love stories. The adaptation of the story and characterization was exceptional good.You should watch this movie for Nana Patekar. based on the life of Mumbai cop Daya Naik this movie deals in a more realistic way. The film delves into the life of the common man, which he has apart from being an encounter specialist. I rate this as one of the best movie of the year",1
10,"This is by far one of the best films that India has ever made. Following are the plus points of the film...Wonderful direction, cinematography and editing, the editing is very smooth and the timing of changeovers is excellent.Even though the film shows the life of Mumbai Policemen and their hardships, it never gets boring or sympathetic.Mind-blowing acting by lead actor Nana Patekar. One can surely hope that he gets nominated for the Best actor for the academy awards.Controlled violence. The violence is controlled and the film doesn't become a bloody mess.No stupid songs as in usual Indian movies.",1
10,I love the way he experiments. Ab Tak Chappan was a thrill to watch just as much Satya and company was. Jatin the new comer also lived up to his role and Nana Patekar was at his best. Suchak was really irritating but I think he fit the character he was playing - he had really ugly teeth. The story has a great progress and no songs in the movie makes it better. I only wish he signs up Urmila for his other up coming movies. I think they are the best director and actress combination I have seen. I have not seen Naach as yet but I am looking forward for it. I for some reason don't find Antra Maali that exciting to watch on the screen - unlike Urmila.,1
4,"He who fights with monsters might take care lest he thereby become a monster. And if you gaze for long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.Yes, this is from Nietzsche's Aphorism 146 from ""Beyond Good and Evil"". And that's what you find at the start of this movie.If you watch the whole movie, you will doubt if it was the message that the Ram Gopal Varma Production wanted to pass on. As the scenes crop up one by one, quite violent and at times puke-raking, the viewer is expected to forget the Nietzsche quote and think otherwise. That to deal with few people you need dedicated people like Sadhu Agashe who will have the licence to kill anyone, not just writing FIRs (something unworthy of the police to do, as we are made to believe).When TADA was repealed and the government wanted to pass newer and even more draconian laws, RGV's ""Satya"" did the required brain surgery without blood transfusion for the multiplex growing thinking urban crowd whose views matters in a democratic country like India. Within a year MCOCA was passed.When real life encounter specialist Daya Nayak 'became a monster on the path of fighting them' and was himself booked by MCOCA, ""Aab tak Chhappan"" was made to heed out ""false"" impression among the people about this. With it's ""you have to be a monster to save your nation"" approach.And people consumed it. No questions raised. Only praises and hopes that they get a Sadhu Agashe in their local police station who will solve all problems and hence let only milk and butter flow all over. Blood? You can ignore.Every time Israel attacks Palestine or Lebanon, we hear voices like ""India must also similarly attack Pakistan"". This movie is made for such psychopaths. If you don't give them this, they will probably die out of boredom and LSD and what not.Hence this game of the passion of hatred.",-1
8,"No music. No stupid masala. A reasonably realistic portrayal of the police system in India and based on a real ""encounter"" specialist in India, Daya Nayak. That is Ab Tak 56 (56 symbolises how many criminals the lead ""Sadhu Agashe"" has killed"" - well you already know that bit)Brilliance exudes Nan Patekar in the role as a relaxed and calculating Indian cop. THe one liners are just hilarious. The plot though slightly predictable on review, is intriguing all the same. Another one of the films from Ram Gopal Vermas The Factory. Movies which are either decent or really good, Ab Tak CHappan meanders close to very good. But yet remains one of the Top 70 films released from India, commercial and artsy included.What is great is the story telling is relaxed and showcases finally (in an Indian flick) how the police network works. The cast is really damn good but seriously the one liners are funny as hell (though i dont know if the subtitled version will appear as funny) The producers are trying for a Cannes release, which is interesting. Made by debut director Shamit Aman (i think thats his name).Again 55 y.o. Nana Patekar is brilliant away from his silly shouting roles of the past, just shows what a good director can do with a good actor. Really good stuff. If you are interested in Indian movies and are disgusted by the nonsense some of our guys dish out then this is definitely a relief.
Again Patekar is the guy who happilly carries the movie on his shoulders and epitomises the style of the movie- relaxed, funny, intelligent and calculating. Good dialoges, good acting, nice direction all in all Great stuff. Recommendations: Gangaajal, Ram Gopal Verma's Company (both Indian flicks)",1
9,"A really realistic, sensible movie by Ramgopal Verma . No stupidity like songs as in other Hindi movies. Class acting by Nana Patekar. Much similarities to real 'encounters'.",1
10,"It was around 2004 after took a glimpse on a trailer, I continued to look for the movie not knowing the title. All I knew was a police story with Nana Patekar (wish to address him Sir) & Revathy. Going around shops describing the movie for almost 8 months only ended after the long list of ""fuyo"" heroics common movies. My hunt was worth as till to date nothings comes near this.Even the 2 top Tamil cop movies which is good, unable to near ATC Ab Tak Chappan. Not many can act without dialog. Nana Patekar is the 1 thing I look forward. Don't miss in Shigard the scene where he will cry after being slapped and continue to laugh as he walks out. Just bought my 4th ATC copy recently. Look forward for ATC2",1
9,"I still remember watching Satya for the first time. I was completely blown away. Here was a movie that was very different so from the other Gangster films that I had seen. So realistic, so Mumbaiyya and so believable. Despite ""Company"" (which was a very good effort) and ""Vaastav"" (more focused on the journey of the protagonist) which came close, no underworld movie could ever live up to Satya.When I watched Ab Tak 56 for the first time, I said to myself ""Indian Cops have their own 'Satya' now"". The quote by Nietzsche in the beginning itself tells you that this is no ordinary film. What strikes you about the ""encounter"" at the start of the film is the relaxed manner in which it is carried out. There is a cold and scary feel to it cos you realize that it is part of their routine.Ab Tak 56 is not the story of an honest cop or a corrupt cop but of a cop who is ready to do what it takes to get rid of the criminals when all lawful means are exhausted. With simple shots and camera angles, director Shimit Amin manages to capture the essence of the characters and gives a realistic and rough feel to the movie. Editing seems non-existent and hence effective. The music is also impressive and haunting and stays with you long after you've left the movie hall.But for me, what really takes the cake are the dialogues and the superlative acting from each and every character. Sandeep Srivastava has done a brilliant job as the dialogue writer. If I start listing my favourite dialogues, I'm afraid I'll end up re-writing the entire script of the movie.The movie boasts of some stellar performances. Yashpal Sharma is detestable as Sub-Inspector Imtiaz Siddiqui and so is Jeeva as Joint Commissioner Suchak. Revathi, Hrishita Bhatt, Mohan Agashe and Kunal Vijaykar have small roles which they play to perfection. Nakul Vaid as the rookie Jatin Shukla was a revelation. The scene where he has to hesitantly shoot the wounded gangster  Oh My God! He learns under the tutelage of Sadhu Aghashe and firmly believes in him.Prasad Purandhare as Zameer Zafar is impressive. His conversations with Sadhu are real jewels of dialogue writing. Never before in Indian cinema has any film brought out such a beautiful relation between a cop and a gangster.Not that I have not been a fan of Nana Patekar before this film but this film pushed me from a fan to a devotee. Nana as Inspector Sadhu Agashe gives the performance of a lifetime and one of the best I've ever seen in Hindi cinema. From the way he talks to his expressions, from the way he taps his cigarette to the way sips his tea  it's almost as if Nana can do no wrong. He is at his best in each and every scene especially when he's teaching Jatin about how the police force functions. His cool and composed manner of doing things is scary at times. His dialogue delivery and body language had me convinced that he is one of the finest actors in the country. It's a shame that he did not win any popular awards for this one.Last but in no way the least, Shimit Amin does a brilliant job of bringing all this talent together and exploiting them to the fullest to come up with a modern masterpiece of Indian cinema. In an industry that is sickeningly accustomed to lifting stories from here and there, Amin takes an original script and brings it to life with a beautiful treatment. I just hope that he continues the great work and doesn't give in to Bollywood-isation! If he can do that, I'm sure he'll be a force to reckon with in the coming years.",1
5,"Although both Raf Vallone and Joseph Bologna register well as father&son Mafia duo of Joe and Bill Bonanno and the source of this film is Gay Talese's account of Bill Bonanno's life up to that point, it does not really tell the story certainly from the point of view of those trying to bring them down. Read the Wikipedia article on the Bonannos. There was a certain resentment of the son by some of the close associates of Joe Bonanno of the nepotism there. And Bill Bonanno was hardly the reluctant don himself.Interesting this came out in 1973 between the release of both Godfather films. The 70s because of the great popularity of The Godfather in both book and film there was a glut of these on the market. It seemed for awhile back then that every other film was a gangster story.I liked what Brenda Vaccaro did with her portrayal of Rosalie Profaci Bonanno, wife of Joseph Bologna. Back in the day this was considered the great Mafia marriage, in their world like Charles and Diana. But Diana had more free will than Rosalie did. As a dutiful Mafia wife who grew up in that world she certainly knew never to ask questions about her husband's business.Also note Richard Castellano in a portrayal similar to what he did as Clemenza in The Godfather.This is the Bonanno version of their internal wars within their crime family. But the Corleones prove more interesting.",-1
5,"At last, the story about New York's underworld. The real-life drama of notorious Joseph ""Joe Bananas"" Bonanno and his heir apparent, son Salvatore (known as Bill).This film suffers from a sloppy, shaking camera, which is probably present in the original aired version. It also happens to be blurry, making it hard to see faces. But that is probably from the transfer, and if an original negative exists, a decent DVD could be released.The film does a very straightforward telling of the Bill Bonanno story, as it has been told by Gay Talese and by Bonanno himself. Exactly how true any of it is, well... that is a matter of opinion. The Bonanno family (both father and son) have spun a lot of baloney about their lives, and who knows how much is accurate. Amazingly, an objective biography has yet to be written.",-1
2,"""Honor Thy Father"" is a very slow, unexciting TV made movie about an inner city Mafia family. A good source for school projects but thats about it. Otherwise, don't watch it for entertainment or you will be bored to death. I just have to say it's a good thing I got this film for free.",-1
2,"I last saw this flick in the 70's, after having read the book it was based on. It didn't take long into the film to realize why it is not on many lists of great ( or good, or for that matter, even fair) gangster flicks. Joe Bologna as Bill Bonnano, Joe's son, is such a whiny character that is hard to see why anyone would pick him to lead a crime family, even if he is the boss' son. Not only is he constantly whining, he also doesn't have a clue as to what anyone is up to. Castellano basically reprises his role as Clemenza from the GF, although he does add hacking out his lungs to show a bit of difference in the two characters. Early in the film, when Joe Bonanno is hiding out to avoid subpoenas, he is shown staying in about the cheapest, flea bag motel that they could find ( which must have been all they could afford on the budget they had for this film). To think that a boss of one of NYC's 5 families would stay at some $20 a night dump is beyond comprehension, although he does manage to stay nattily attired in full suit while sitting in the room. Other discrepancies involve cars that don't fit the time frame, hair styles from the 70's being used in the early 60's, and other inappropriate mix-ups. The most idiotic part is the attempted hit on Bill, when the street is absolutely empty of any people or traffic ( in NYC no less), while Bill and his entourage park quite a distance away in order to walk down the street, where numerous gunman shoot at them with never emptying revolvers from multiple locations, yet never hit anyone. The film also has the older actors talk in a weird, stilted way that somehow Hollywood screenwriters and directors think make mafioso sound wise , unlike the way real street mafioso speak.",-1
9,"Considering that this was a made for TV movie without a high budget, I was impressed. What carries the movie forward is the great acting. Raf Vallone is one of the best Italian actors in Italian cinema history as any Italian film buff can attest to. He portrays Joseph Bonanno with intensity, emotion, calm demeanor, and gives a well rounded and balanced performance. Vallone must have studied how Mr. Bonanno carried himself in life. It is obvious that he was an honorable person trying to protect his family, and Vallone depicts this perfectly. As for the other actors, they are all veterans of the New York Italian American school of acting: Joseph Bologna and Richard Castellano (of GODFATHER fame) give authentic portrayals of Sal Bonanno and Frank LaBruzzo. They are just so natural and very New York. Apparently they do not even need to act....they are just being themselves. That is why this movie is so realistic and genuine. Sam Coppola (of Saturday Night Fever as Mr. Fusco) and Carmine Caridi (of Prince of the City) also give admirable performances. Overall I rate this movie at 9 out of 10. I recommend it.",1
4,"Here we are in the Swiss Village exhibit at the Paris Exposition. See the men leading cattle! See the women dancing with women because the men are busy with cattle!It's ok, although there's little of interest in this movie, besides the fact that it was happening someplace the audience couldn't get to. That was a major attraction of early movies, and a reason why they seem so dull to the modern film viewer. If you want to see Swiss men with cows and Swiss women dancing with other women, why not go there? Or see something that came out of Switzerland?That wasn't an option for any but a tiny number of people. What came out of Switzerland in this period for most Americans was expensive watches and cheese. With this movie, you got Switzerland.... and Paris, too.",-1
9,"any doctor can do plastic surgery Jane GreerThe show begins on a very stirring note--a woman, despite her husband's pleas, jumps from a building to her death. During the subsequent autopsy, Quincy notices that despite the damage from the fall, the woman was horribly scarred from a botched plastic surgery. It seems that the woman couldn't stand how she looked and this led to her killing herself. Then, when Quincy learns of another botched surgery from the same doctor, he's out on a crusade to stop this butcher. Yet, again and again, he's frustrated--frustrated that any doctor can do plastic surgery regardless of his or her training and also frustrated because the system moves so slowly to put a stop to such incompetence. Quincy's only chance to convince the court to stop the incompetent doctor is to get a famous actress (Jane Greer) to come forward and show the world how he turned her into a deformed creature.Sometimes I like the 'crusader Quincy' episodes and occasionally I don't. This one worked well for me and was a very emotional episode. Plus, although the show aired well over thirty years ago, this sort of problem STILL exists--as gynecologists, psychiatrist and podiatrists CAN open up a plastic surgery practice without no specialized training. Overall, the show packs a great emotional wallop and it's as good now as when it first aired.",1
5,"Quincy M.E.: The Depth of Beauty starts late one night on top of an eighteen storey Los Angeles apartment block as forty seven year old Sheila Connors (Joanna Patrice) commits suicide by jumping off the roof. Los Angeles coroner Quincy (Jack Klugman) records the death as suicide but he is puzzled & intrigued by extensive scarring on her face, after speaking to her husband (Ryan MacDonald) Quincy learns that his wife committed suicide because of the state cosmetic surgeon Dr. Emile Green (Garnett Smith) left her face in. Quincy investigates Green & discovers that he is not a trained plastic surgeon, he has left countless women dead or horribly mutilated & can get away with it as there are no provisions in the law to stop him. Outraged Quincy becomes determined to stop Green operating on people & get the inadequate laws changed...Episode 13 from season 4 this Quincy story was directed by Ray Danton & is alright but I can't work up much more enthusiasm up for it than that, The Depth of Beauty is more of a moral episodes where Quincy ends up on some social crusade against red tape, inadequate laws & bureaucracy. Here Quincy tackles the unlicensed cosmetic surgery trade & those who get rich from it but aren't properly trained or qualified, it's one of those stories which is hard to relate to since I really do think things have changed. In the year 2008 I just couldn't see a doctor getting away with some of the things Green does, I mean we live a 'compensation culture' type society where we sue everyone & everything for all we can get & someone like Green just wouldn't be able to continue operating today in any civilised Western country & I firmly believe that. The murder here is by default, there's no mystery elements & one could say it's a trifle predictable. Still having said that I always enjoy watching Quincy shout at people, get angry & try to blame everyone for everything but sometimes that just isn't enough. It's OK for the type of episode it is but I wouldn't call it a classic.The Depth of Beauty is one of the very few Quincy episodes which doesn't feature Lt. Monahan at all (despite his name still appearing in the opening credits), even at Danny's at the end he is oddly missing. There is a fairly effective scene in this when one of Green's victims reveals the extent of her facial injuries & scars to the camera & it's a pretty decent make-up job with lots of scars & a droopy slanted eye. The acting is alright by all involved.The Depth of Beauty is an average moralistic conscience pricking episode of Quincy, it's watchable & fine for what it is but in my opinion it's not any sort of classic.",-1
4,"The Depth of Beauty begins with a disfigured woman committing suicide by jumping from the rooftop of her high-rise apartment building. Quincy (Jack Klugman) conducts the autopsy and is baffled over the extensive scarring on her face which was clearly the result of a cosmetic surgery gone bad. He meets with her husband who advises Quincy that she was so distraught over the work done by her surgeon, Dr. Emile Green (Garnett Smith), that she felt suicide was her only option. When questioned by Quincy, Dr. Green denies any responsibility and callously blames the victim infuriating Quincy and putting him on a mission to shut him down. Quincy meets with representatives from the District Attorneys office who confirm that they have a stack of complaints against the incompetent doctor, but are lacking the evidence to do anything about in terms of criminal charges under the law. This prompts Quincy to take out a newspaper ad in an effort to locate additional victims of incompetent plastic surgeries so that they may obtain the evidence needed to move forward, and a former actress named Dorrie Larkin (Jane Greer) who was also disfigured by Dr. Green responds.I was shocked that this episode is rated as highly as it is here because I found it to be astoundingly incompetent and stupid. First off, if there had been so many quality of care and wrongful death complaints filed with the DA's office against this doctor, why was none of this coordinated with the state review board for revocation of his medical license if criminal charges could not be filed? There was plenty of compelling evidence to warrant this and the medical review board has a lower burden of proof than a criminal court. Instead, we have Quincy, a medical professional himself, meeting with two other legal and medical professionals at the DA's office and this doesn't occur to any of them?? It isn't until later at the lab that Dr. Asten (John S. Ragin) finally suggests this obvious avenue to Quincy. Ridiculous!! I also could not believe the storyline involving the mother who lost her daughter after Dr. Green left her with an open wound following surgery. If it was as horrendous as she described where she could ""see her insides"", why would you have not taken her to the hospital immediately for treatment rather than waiting for two days making unsuccessful calls to the surgeon's office. Stupid!! I also wasn't buying that out of all these horrendous medical complaints that not a single one of them resulted in a huge medical malpractice lawsuit against Dr. Green. Some of the victims and lawyers definitely would have taken him on in the courts and put him out of business.Finally, I found the whole nobody is willing to do anything or take action against this doctor until a big celebrity (Dorrie Larkin) gets involved to be an extremely irresponsible and misleading message. How was her case different from any of the others and such a game changer? It is not necessary for a celebrity to come forward to stop egregious behavior as described in this story and any citizen has the power to do so by contacting the proper government authorities, legal professionals and media. To suggest otherwise was so offensive.Overall, an extremely poor Season 4 episode with no mystery whatsoever and plenty of misinformation and stupidity all around.",-1
10,"I enjoyed the film - very gritty and realistic, although perhaps a bit dark at times. The cinematography was first rate. I liked James Faracci's acting - understated and enigmatic - almost giving his character an inscrutable quality which lent great authenticity to the film.",1
6,"This installment of the Tarzan series starring Johnny Weissmuller is very similar to one of these movies made just a few years later, ""Tarzan Finds a Son!"". Both have family members who come to retrieve one of Tarzan's family to take them back to civilization to retrieve a large inheritance and in both cases, it turns out that some of these 'nice people' aren't so nice after all.The episode begins with Jane's family arriving at the Tarzan residence. They inform Jane that she's an heiress to the family fortune and that she should come back with them to claim it. None of them realize that the Captain, however, is unconcerned about this and has evil plans of his own. But, when this jerk tries to make a pact with a local tribe of nasties, the nasties turn out to be even bigger jerks and it looks like all the white folks are about to breath their last.There are a few nice things about this film. E.E. Clive plays a very nice part as a guy who really seems taken with Tarzan and his lovely consort. Additionally, the film is very, very romantic--almost as much as ""Tarzan and His Mate"". However, the film also features very, very vague motivations for the Captain and you really never have any idea why he does what he does. There are also a few odd inconsistencies--such as Cheeta being called a 'she' despite featuring very large male anatomy! Also there is that stupid looking bird-like thing that made me laugh--and which was also in a bit scene in ""Tarzan's Secret Treasure"". And, like all the early Weissmuller Tarzan films it features Asian elephants with weird fake prosthetic ears! All in all, a decent but not particularly inspired entry but it's a darn shame that it's practically the same major plot ideas as are found in ""Tarxan Finds a Son"". Oh, and by the way, look for Tarzan to inexplicably use the word 'escarpment'!",1
4,"Although the MGM Tarzan films with Johnny Weissmuller were usually of high quality I had some problems with Tarzan Escapes. This film which does have a bit of continuity in it to connect with the two previous Weissmuller outings, I had some trouble wrapping my mind around the plot.The story has Maureen O'Sullivan's cousins from Great Britain, William Henry and Benita Hume searching for Jane to resolve an inheritance issue back in the old country. They want her to go, but their guide John Buckler also would like to get the famous white ape man Tarzan back into civilization for exhibition.Try as I might I could not believe that Buckler was able to trick Tarzan as easily as he did. The Tarzan we know has a lot more jungle smarts than what is shown here. Of course he doesn't stay captive long, it helps to be on a first name basis with all the elephants in the jungle.Herbert Mundin is always good to have around as he plays Buckler's assistant and one with a conscience. Mundin played a variation on his role as the timid seaman in Mutiny On The Bounty in Tarzan Escapes. Mundin was always a favorite of mine and his death in a car crash in 1940 robbed the screen of a very funny character actor.But what was really freaky was reading about John Buckler who was killed right after making this film also in a car crash with his father, actor Hugh Buckler. Buckler drowns in a swamp in this one and in real life drove into a river and also drowned.Though the film has the usual MGM production values that a place like RKO couldn't bring to its later Tarzans, the story here was a bit much for me to swallow.",-1
7,"When I was a kid watching these Tarzan flicks, there was one film, and this might be the one, that introduced the term 'juju' as something to be feared or forbidden. The word just captivated my imagination for some reason that I can't explain even today, but this movie brought it all back to mind. Funny how one's mind works.Going back a half century or so when I was first introduced to Johnny Weissmuller's Tarzan movies, I can't remember today which ones I saw but this one seemed familiar. I instinctively knew what was going to happen next a number of times, an example being the elephant who came to Tarzan's aid in the steel cage and dunked him in the river to wake him up. One of the odder segments was that goofy looking flightless bird that looked like it stepped off the set of ""Alice in Wonderland"". I'm pretty sure I've seen it before in a picture like that but don't ask me to nail it down.I wasn't surprised to see Tarzan take on a crocodile in the story, Weissmuller did it any number of times in his Jungle Jim flicks a little over a decade later. The thing is, it looked more real in this film than the rubberized versions used later on, so that was a head scratcher. However the Jungle Jim movies were done on a way cheaper budget, so that probably explains a lot.As for the main story, I found it interesting that the expedition led by Captain Fry (John Buckler) traveled through all sorts of terrain to find Jane (Maureen O'Sullivan) and her Great White Ape companion. There were swamps, a desert, highlands and mountains in addition to your standard jungle setting, and the story offered a lot of clever contraptions Tarzan put together for his tree-house home. It was cool to see Cheetah on hand as well; his little interlude with the zebra added a nice comedic touch to the picture.With only a handful of Weissmuller's Tarzan films viewed recently, this is probably the most romantic one involving the relationship between Tarzan and Jane. That scene that went to a fade when Jane released the water lily into the stream could have only meant one thing, and it was quite tastefully done. It makes you glad Jane decided to hang around the jungle when all was said and done, and made the picture one of the better Tarzan films, even with some of the other goofy stuff going on.One last thought - Cheetah's laugh - it kills me every time I hear it.",1
8,"Let me say two things right off the ""bat:""1 - This is one of the better Tarzan films; 2 - The title is a misnomer. Tarzan doesn't get trapped anywhere to escape from until the last 20 minuets and he isn't in a cage long enough to warrant that title.This film also is noted for it being chopped down a bit at the last minute. Apparently, a scene or two was a little too scary for preview audiences (giant bats in a swamp, for instance) so they edited it out at the last minute. They didn't re-shoot the material to make the transition smooth, so there are a few holes in the story's last 15 minutes. But it's nothing major and doesn't detract from the interesting adventure.Slowly browsing through the recently-released ""Tarzan Collection"" DVD pack has made me appreciate these films all over again. They were really great entertainment. There were very few, if any, boring lulls in these films and some of the African wildlife footage is still amazing to this day!Tarzan Escapes is considered one of the best in the series, even if some parts were cut. It's very entertaining with the typical mix of adventure, humor, good guys vs. bad guys, romance and the like. In this film, elephants are the heroes, coming to the defense of Tarzan (Johnny Weissmuller).; the humor is provided by a member of the safari team ; Jane (Maureen O'Sullivan) doesn't appear the first half hour and the action ends with some great film-noir like photography in a swamp (minus the bats). Along the way are an assortment of wild animals and birds, always interesting to view. It's a fast-moving 89 minutes.",1
7,"Nasty hunter Captain Fry (John Buckler) leads an expedition to Tarzan's stomping ground with the aim of capturing the ape-man and exhibiting him in England. Unaware of Fry's nefarious intentions, Jane's cousins, Eric and Rita (William Henry and Benita Hume), tag along for the journey hoping to convince their relative to return to England in order to help them claim the fortune that has been left to them in a will.It's back to the Mutia escarpment for more jungle action in the third of the Weissmuller Tarzan films; unfortunately, this time around, much of what made the first two films so much fun—the gloriously un-PC violence and steamy sexuality—is missing thanks to the introduction of the Hays code, Hollywood's moral guidelines.So instead of Maureen O'Sullivan giving us an eyeful in her animal skin bikini, we have her wearing a much more demure dress, and when the film gets down to the dispatching of native bearers, much of the nastiness happens off-screen; the film also suffers due to a troubled production which saw much of the original film being re-shot and re-edited. It all amounts to a rather tame offering that lacks the thrills and spills of Weissmuller's earlier outings as the affable ape-man (even the nasty execution via tree that horrified me as a child was less gruesome than I remembered).Still, the film remains fairly watchable thanks to the chemistry between Weissmuller and O'Sullivan, some funny antics from Cheetah the Chimp (she teases lion cubs, attempts to ride a zebra, and laughs as comedy relief Rawlins tries to master swinging on a vine), the impressive sight of Tarzan's 'town-house' (complete with elephant powered elevator!), and one particularly bizarre scene featuring a weird dodo-like bird (which I presume must have been performed by a man with no legs, walking on his hands in a feathered suit!!!).6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.",1
6,"Johnny Weissmuller's third round as the loin-clothed Tarzan is a passable time-filler, nothing more. Plot has the Ape Man outwitting smarmy game-hunters who'd like to exhibit Tarzan as a freakish novelty back in England. Well-produced entry in the long-running series apparently had some directorial trouble behind the scenes, with credited director Richard Thorpe getting some unsung assistance. The sly sexual bits involving Maureen O'Sullivan's Jane are amusing, and the action sequences rousing, but there's nothing exceptionally fresh here to entice non-Tarzan buffs. Fans and film-historians should be more than satisfied. **1/2 from ****",1
5,"Arriving in Africa from England are handsome medical student William Henry (as Eric Parker) and his attractive sister Benita Hume (as Rita). They are on the continent to find cousin Maureen O'Sullivan (Jane) and bring her back to civilization, where they hope she will claim an inheritance of half a million pounds. Living among the apes by choice, Ms. O'Sullivan mated with jungle man Johnny Weissmuller (Tarzan) in ""Tarzan and His Mate"" (1934). Jane's cousins consider themselves lucky to find safari guide John Butler (as Captain Fry), but he secretly plans to cage Tarzan and display him as an exhibit... Not much happens here that hasn't happened before, some of it even in the previous MGM Tarzan adventures. The plot about bringing Tarzan and Jane back to civilization by hook or by crook didn't work before, and it won't work again. The title ""Tarzan Escapes"" should be comforting. As this installment was released after the enforcement of the Hays Production Code, MGM had O'Sullivan wear a much more modest costume. This isn't a total loss, however, as O'Sullivan is still sexy and beautiful. This was noticed by writer/director John Farrow, one of those brought in to patch up production problems.***** Tarzan Escapes (11/6/36) Richard Thorpe ~ Johnny Weissmuller, Maureen O'Sullivan, William Henry, Benita Hume",-1

The cousins played by Benita Hume and William Henry, hire Captain Fry, an evil white trapper, to guide them to Tarzan and Jane. His motive is to capture Tarzan and take him back to civilization as a caged exhibit.Johnny Weissmuller, the most popular Tarzan, manages to escape and come to the rescue of the others that are being held captive. Equally popular as Jane is Maureen O'Sullivan. There is some romantic quality provided by Weismuller and O'Sullivan that makes them the best team of jungle mates. The bad Captain Fry is played by John Buckler and his bumbling side kick is played by Herbert Mundin.",1
7,"Johnny Weissmuller once again dons the loin cloth in this fun and breezy adventure for Edgar Rice Burroughs' famous creation. Directed by Richard Thorpe, story has Tarzan fending of the nefarious intentions of an expedition group who plan to take Jane (Maureen O'Sullivan)) back to civilisation, and Tarzan into side-show captivity.Weissmuller flexes his muscles and gets help from his wildlife pals, while Jane wonderfully looks like she's auditioning for the porn movie version of the plot. Action is brisk, the dialogue not clunky, and the all round sense of adventurous fun never once leaves the scene. The wildlife footage is impressive for the time and Leonard Smith's photography is very slick.There's some holes in the plot, but it matters not in the grand scheme of 30s Tarzan movies, it's the sort of film you watched as a kid and adored, and now as adults we go back to find it has thankfully lost none of its charm. Now, where is Jane's telephone number? 7/10",1
9,"""Tarzan Escapes"" is both a beautiful love story and great jungle adventure—I couldn't ask for nothing else since this movie even gives us the violence. This time we see Tarzan battling a crocodile, cutting it with his knife, the blood flowing in the river water. There are some recycled scenes that seem lifted from the first film such as a rescue consisting of a great elephant stampede, Cheetah the orangutan fleeing a lion, and Tarzan having to save Jane and her cousins from a savage native tribe.What is unique about this one is the unwavering affection between Tarzan and Jane, their devotion to each other is touching and sweet. What is super cool, if totally unrealistic, is the architectural dynamo that is Tarzan and Jane's treehouse! They even have an elevator (made out of wood) with a rope that is pulled by an elephant's nose which allows people to be lifted up to the treehouse, not to mention, Tarzan has developed a water system and bridge that connects two treehouses. Oh, and Jane now can swing from vines, and her costume is an amazing patchwork of fabrics which cover all the bits, showing off her stunning figure and legs. She also has these amazing curly locks as if Jane had her own cosmetologist on standby in the jungle somewhere. Tarzan still wears the loincloth, bellows the familiar iconic yell, and remains language-impaired (but is getting better the longer he spends with Jane).I think the best scene could be a POV shot as Tarzan draws closer to Jane (she looks adoringly right at us, to the camera, with director Thorpe also quickly showing Tarzan's face before he accepts her open arms), a flower in her hand released into the water next to her, obviously implying that the two are about to make love. There's this awesome scene where two elephants help Tarzan escape from a steel cage by bending the bars with their snouts! The villain of this particular Tarzan movie is ""great white hunter"" Captain Fry (John Buckler, who would die in a car accident drowning the same year), who sees a profit in exploiting Tarzan's gifts with animals in England, making a potential alliance with a heathen tribe, which goes awry.Maureen O'Sullivan, a sophisticated and gentle little beauty, has some marvelous scenes where she faces splitting from Tarzan, the very notion of such a separation anguishing, but important in her mind because to sign a ""piece of paper"" (she was willed a fortune but doesn't really have an interest in wealth because of her happiness in the uncivilized world with Tarzan) would provide her cousins Rita (Benita Hume) and Eric (William Henry) with a comfortable income and living. Herbert Mundin is Fry's bumbling, cowardly right hand man, Rawlins, completely utilized as a comic foil for not only Tarzan, but is the victim of monkey laughter as one orangutan gets the giggles when he attempts to swing on a vine. Tragic consequences for Rawlins when he discovers the sneaky, underhanded Fry's nefarious scheme; Fry, you just know, will get his comeuppance. There's this atmospheric swamp Tarzan will lead Jane and company through in order to escape the savage natives who fear the ""ju-ju"" of such a scary place with iguanas lurking about. I would LOVE to see the original film before ""Tarzan Escapes"" was reshot (the crew and some cast members replaced) which has gained a notoriety for having been too graphically violent. That said, I found much to enjoy with this Tarzan adventure. The kid in me just eats this up. Some might find this a bit campy (considering Cheetah's antics and Rawlins' goofy bumpkin) and its romance story a bit sappy, but I really adore the casting of Weissmuller and O'Sullivan as Tarzan and Jane; their genuine chemistry I find irresistible. I thought Buckler was very good as the treacherous Fry because he seems like a trustworthy gentleman (you do see glimpses of a dark side like when he whips some of his African slaves), only to show his true greedy self which backfires on him; his fate is particularly disturbing as Tarzan will not allow him to follow them to safety. Seeing Tarzan and Jane grappling with the idea of being apart is really kind of gut-wrenching!",1
8,"Third film in the Johnny Weissmuller--Maureen O'Sullivan Tarzan series.  Two of Jane's cousins come to the jungle to persuade her to return to civilization.  With them is safari hunter Captain Fry (John Buckler) who secretly has plans to capture Tarzan and bring him back to civilization as a sideshow attraction.  And then there is the vicious native tribe near by...Not as good as the first two (which were great) but still very enjoyable. This film was a disaster--it took 2 years to make and went through multiple rewrites, reshoots, cutting, editing and was overhauled completely when a test audience hated it.  The film is pretty violent (for 1936) but the original was even more so with a vampire bat sequence that got completely cut out!  The sex has been toned down too--Jane is dressed VERY modestly this time around and she's fully clothed during the underwater swimming sequence (she was totally nude in ""Tarzan and his Mate"".  Still, this film isn't really for kids.  The violence IS pretty strong.  Also Tarzan and Jane's tree house is quite elaborate this time around.  And there are shots of Cheetah laughing that are hysterical.The acting varies--Weissmuller is very good as Tarzan--his emotions show clearly through his face (but he does look a little old in a few sequences); O'Hara is still bad as Jane and everybody else is TERRIBLE--especially Buckler and Herbert Munder (stuck with the thankless ""comic"" relief role).Still this is fast-moving with plenty of action.  Worth catching.",1
7,"The Hays Code brought the Tarzan Series down from Adult Adventure to Teen Adventure (this one) to the Kiddie Adventures to come after.""Tarzan Escapes"" was made prior to the Hays Code but was released after it took effect and therein is the Problem with the Third in the Series. It Suffers from Extended Reshoots and Editing the ""Good Stuff"". Although the Movie does Retain a bit of the Jungle Violence, the Nasty Natives of Previous Entries, and a Few Scenes of Terror, it Loses the Pre-Code Edge and is Replaced with some Clunky Scenes (Tarzan walking zombie like with depression and extended Cheetah shenanigans).Overall, the Story of Tarzan being Caged and put on Exhibition is a Nervous Anxiety and some Safari Scenes Impress, the much Talked About Ju-Ju is Only Talked About.After this, when the Hays Code and ""Boy"" showed up, the Series fell into a ""Flintstones"" Frolic that can at times be Witnessed in this one. The Beginning of the End for Tarzan as an Adult Adventure.",1
3,"Using tons of stock footage, not only from Trader Horn but also the first two films in the series (for example the alligator fight was used last time out) this is one of the weakest films in the MGM series. Its a huge let down after the classic Tarzan and His Mate which is possibly the best film in the series.The plot has Jane's cousins coming into the jungle to tell her that she has inherited a fortune if she'll come back to claim it. They are kind of in the bind since the relative that left her the money cut them out of the will.Hiring a great white hunter, who secretly wishes to capture Tarzan and sell him, the pair heads into the jungle where they run into the usual jungle troubles (more so because of the stock footage). After lots of talk Jane decides to go back to civilization and we get long sequences of Tarzan and Jame making kissy face. Finally into the last half hour the plot to capture Tarzan is put in motion and things at last become interesting as plans go awry and things look very grim for all concerned..Painfully dull film is clear evidence of a troubled production. the film seems to have been assembled from several different films with the first half hour playing as an almost exact repeats of the previous film. The middle third shows signs of having to stretch things out and having plot lines that ultimately went nowhere. The last third where Tarzan is captured and the party is put into peril is the point that the film finally comes to life (it also shows signs of the graphic violence that caused much of the need to re-shoot the film). To me its a great wonder how the series managed to continue on from here since this film isn't very good (except at the end).I would be hard pressed to explain it except I would have to say that it was the relationship between Weissmuller and O'Sullivan as Tarzan and Jane which kept people coming back. Its a beautifully acted pairing and really is one of the screens great couples.(I should probably also mention that this is the point that the film became less real and more fantastical with the appearance of the Tarzan tree house.) I really dislike the first hour or so of this film a great deal and find it a great waste of time and energy. If you can come in towards the end I would recommend giving the film a try. Otherwise I would just skip the whole film and move on to the next film in the series.",-1
7,"Jane's cousins come to Africa looking to take her back to England. They enlist the help of a big game hunter who, like every hunter in the Tarzan series, is evil. None of this goes over well with Tarzan. Third entry in MGM's Tarzan series is less impressive than the first two but still entertaining in its own right. Maureen O'Sullivan's charm and playful chemistry with Johnny Weissmuller is the best part of the movie. Actually, it's probably the best part of the entire series to me.As other reviewers have discussed, this one was meddled with by the studio, who deemed the original cut too violent after poor screenings. Unfortunately, we'll probably never know how good that version was. The biggest cut we know of is the much-talked about climax involving giant bats. It sounds pretty cool and I hope someday a copy of that cut exists so we can see it. Still, even with the cuts, the climax of this film is still exciting. It's an enjoyable film, even if it doesn't hold up well compared to the two that preceded it. Weissmuller and O'Sullivan are terrific. The rest of the cast is pretty good, too, with Herbert Mundin a standout. I can't imagine any fan of the series not liking this one, even if the spectre of ""what might have been"" hangs over it. Too bad about those bats, though.",1
6,"As incongruous as it may sound, I'm beginning to detect similar patterns between the ""Tarzan"" and the ""Rocky"" series, a hunch I'll use to structure my review of the misleadingly titled ""Tarzan Escapes"", directed by Richard Thorpe and an uncredited John Farrow.While the first ""Rocky"" film is more celebrated, ""Tarzan: the Ape Man"" is a true American classic nonetheless; marked by the legendary encounter of Tarzan and Jane, Johnny Weismuller and Maureen O'Sullivan who'd form one of the most endearing and enduring couples of Hollywood history just like Sylvester Stallone and Talia Shire with Rocky and Adrian. Their chemistry never inspired dubiousness and contributed to the film's best moments, which is saying a lot. And the second opus of both series marked a romantic culmination and ""Tarzan and his Mate"" featured some incredibly erotic shots, pinpointing the final breaths of creative freedom before the Hays Code would impose the most suffocating diktats of respectability.So ""Tarzan Escapes"" is the ""Rocky III"" of the series, there's an obvious change of tone that betrays its obedience to the rampant puritanism that will slowly affect American celluloid. Jane has traded her sexy top halter for a more modest clothing item though we're conceded some generous shots on her legs every once in a while. Meanwhile, the plot is just a throwaway excuse to challenge her relationship with Tarzan, some vague cousins need her to come back to London for some financial issues, a rather bland William Henry is the young and well meaning Eric Parker and Rita (Benita Hume) is like a Jane Parker from the first film without the self-confidence, the humor and the perkiness. On the casting department, the cousins are only there to remind us one last (?) time about Jane's roots.In a much showier role, there's the greedy explorer Captain Fry (John Buckley) who's so eager to help the Parkers to find Jane that we suspect his intentions might not be as pure as he pretends to, and to make the outsiders a tad more colorful and interesting, there's also Herbert Mundin playing Rawlins, the second in command in the comedy department... after Cheetah of course. I knew his face was familiar, he was the actor who flirted with Una O'Connor in ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" and was a nice addition to the film, a shame that he died in a car crash a few years later (sadly enough, even Buckley prematurely died in an accident). Finally, speaking of Cheetah, she's more and more present and is obviously the third wheel of the relationships' dynamics like Paulie in the ""Rocky"" franchise, though Cheetah was probably better-mannered.That exhaustive description leaves us with Johnny Weissmuller who's as athletic and at the top of his game for what's perhaps the less demanding role for a top athlete; and yet within his limited range of facial expressions and vocabulary (he made some progresses and so did Jane) he's perfect. And the plot, while not exactly revolutionary, is a solid vehicle to the usual characterization of both Tarzan and Jane as the king (and queen) of the jungle... with an exception this time: they have built their castle. They don't live in a cave anymore but in a sort of Flintstones-like treehouse where all the furniture and necessary equipment are available. It's cute in an urbane way, but the way it's all mundanely treated destroys all the values Tarzan proudly stood for: the adaptation not the triumph over nature, the raw and animal manhood conquering the heart of a bourgeois woman who realizes the futility of the Western comfort. Obviously, Jane did to Tarzan what victories did to Rocky... he got civilized... you can tell he doesn't feel comfortable, less than Cheetah anyway who had already made her marks.And speaking for myself, I had the uncomfortable feeling that the film was distancing itself too much from the original material and it wouldn't get any better. There were still a few reminiscences of the glowing romance between Tarzan and Jane, a magnificent kiss where Tarzan approaches his face and the camera zooms on Jane who, in a state of ecstatic self-abandonment, drops a lotus flowers on a lake. A moment like this makes the film worthy of its predecessor and it was so perfect that the film didn't even need another swimming session.Another aspect that didn't change either was the usual colonial racism displayed against the Natives and the way their deaths never carry any emotional resonance. I'm waiting for the ""Tarzan"" film where an African would play a more substantial role. It's true that the villains in the film (so far) are greedy explorers, but this time there's a difference since the standards of life that Jane escaped from in the first, and rejected in the second (the gifts she was offered) have been exported into Tarzan's life, which is a concession from the ape man's part. I can understand that one of the Hays Code' requirements was to establish that the Western civilization is a good, for lack of a better word, but the new house turns it into a joke.Another more serious ""joke"" is the misguided and disturbing moment where a lioness is shot because Rita, Jane's cousin cuddled one of her cubs, maybe it was self-defense but the mother was also reacting from instinct. It's very indicative of the attitude of a film wasn't exactly made with the idea that these images would chock in fifty years, just like Tintin's infamous adventures in Congo. And I guess within that naivety, only the romance between Tarzan and Jane emerges as the only reason to enjoy the series, that and a few thrills and comedic effect.On that level, the ending is perfect and Cheetah's scream is a clever nod to the audience, not to mention one of the best parts of the film.",1
7,"This may in fact have been the first movie in history to be the third installment in a series. It wasn't until much later that numbered sequels would even be applied to movies. I really do not like the title because it implies that Tarzan is captured and then he escapes from the city like King Kong. He is in fact captured in this movie, but he immediately escapes and it's pretty irrelevant to the rest of the movie. Anyway, this was still nice. I think my favorite bit would probably be how the sets still look great. I believe they used actual animals for this and it shows.I admit the plot could be better. It features Jane's cousin trying to bring her back to the city. It really is nice to see how this connects to the previous two films. It's not that much of a direct continuation, but still good. It's great to see all the characters and settings the original two movies had. While not a classic, it's still pretty enjoyable. It just has a very humble feeling to it and it's nice to see such an iconic star like Johnny Weismuller in such an iconic role. ***",1
9,"TARZAN ESCAPES (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1936), directed by Richard Thorpe, based on the characters created by Edgar Rice Burroughs, reunites Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan in their third outing as Tarzan and Jane. While this ranks as one of the finer films in the series, it's best known today mostly for an intense scene that doesn't exist in the finished product. Following the controversial TARZAN AND HIS MATE (1934) with such notables as Jane's skimpy two-piece outfit along with her long shot skinny dipping alongside Tarzan, TARZAN ESCAPES does have its moments of controversy such as some graphic violence, with much of it trimmed, hence the Production Code that had recently gone into effect.The story starts off with plot development and character introduction involving Rita and Eric (Benita Hume and William Henry) who hire Captain Fry (John Buckler, whose physical appearance resembles that of Basil Rathbone) to lead them to the Mulia Escarpment and locate their cousin, Jane Parker, living somewhere in the jungles of Africa. During their expedition, which consists of Herbert Henry Rawlins, better known as Jiggs (Herbert Mundin), and Bomba, (Darby Jones), Fry's native boy, the Parkers do find Jane (O'Sullivan), taking residence in a tree house with Tarzan (Weissmuller), her mate. After a happy reunion, Rita informs Jane of a large inheritance and must return to England in order to claim it. Learning that they have financed the expedition with their last savings, and being torn between her loyalty to her family and Tarzan, Jane agrees to go on the condition that she's spend an entire day with Tarzan before departing, with the indication that Tarzan understands that she will be return after signing the documents to have the couple rightfully claim the money. In the meantime, Fry, who reveals himself as a conniving villain, convinces Tarzan that Jane is never coming back and succeeds into tricking Tarzan into a specialty built metal cage where he attempts to take the jungle man back to civilization where Fry attempts to make money by showcasing him as a circus attraction.TARZAN ESCAPES has Tarzan doing just as the title indicates. After he is caged, and desperate in reclaiming Jane, he manages to break out with the help of his elephant friends, and avenge himself on the evil Fry. As mentioned earlier, the most celebrated scene missing from the final print is the one where Tarzan fights off devil bats and hostile pygmies in a haze-shrouded swamp. According to one of the ""Tarzan"" documentaries featuring O'Sullivan reminiscing about how the terrifying devil bat scene took nearly a week to complete, only to be deleted following a preview by which audiences found too intense. Although much of the movie had been toned down through edits and revisions, which explains why it was in production for nearly two years, the finished product of TARZAN ESCAPES can still be considered graphic for its time anyway, especially in what results with certain characters, especially Captain Fry, making this possibly the last ""adult oriented"" Tarzan adventure. Herbert Mundin as Jiggs, along with Tarzan's pet chimp, Cheetah, set the tone in breaking away from the seriousness in obtaining moments of amusement, such as Jiggs attempting to swing from tree to tree on Tarzan's vine with not much success. This became the last in the series to provide Jane with her operatic distress call as well as her leaping from the tree into the arms of Tarzan like a professional acrobat.As much as Johnny Weissmuller can be criticized for his bad acting at times, and doing nothing more than being Tarzan of the movies, belting out his jungle yells for example, he's more articulate than in the previous two films, with his speech consisting of mono syllables that would remain through the duration of the Tarzan/Weissmuller series, he convincingly shows the emotional impact and tender side to his character, especially the thought of losing Jane. In a rare instance used in the series, Tarzan's fight in him is gone and at this point doesn't care what happens to him as he lets himself get captured by hunters. He shows his true love for Jane in allowing her return to England, especially through those sentimental moments as the couple spend their last day together at their own private Garden of Eden swimming and resting themselves alongside the lake. This tender scene usually got the ax whenever this 90 minute movie played on a 90 minute time shot on commercial television, which could be shown that way without spoiling the continuity so to have longer ad time. Regardless of difficulties in getting this movie completed, this third MGM installment is certainly no disappointment. TARZAN ESCAPES, along with other Tarzan adventures produced by MGM, were distributed on video cassette in the early 1990s, and presented, with the exception of TARZAN THE APE MAN (1932), to have a successful run on American Movie Classics from 1997 to 2000, before premiering on Turner Classic Movies in June 2004 along with its distribution on DVD about the same time.(***) Next chapter: TARZAN FINDS A SON (1939).",1
8,"Tarzan Escapes was released on VHS in the UK by Warner Brothers as part of a box set which also includes Tarzan Finds a Son and Tarzan and His Mate. I enjoyed this one.Janes cousins, Eric and Rita arrive in the jungle to look for Jane to tell her she has inherited a lot of money. They arrive with Captain Fry, who plans to kidnap Tarzan and have him as part of his freak show. He does manage to get him into a cage but with the help of some of his elephant friends and Cheetah, he escapes and towards the end, gets his revenge when he makes Fry go back into a cave they just went through where there are hungry lizards and Fry is killed.As always, Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan are excellent as Tarzan and Jane.Tarzan Escapes is a must for any Tarzan fan. Great fun.Rating: 3 and a half stars out of 5.",1
6,"That's not to say this is not quite good. No Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan certainly shine as the romantic leads Tarzan and Jane. In fact, this may be the most romantic of all the Weissmuller films so if that's what attracts you, you'll likely love this. However if jungle adventure and fun is more up your alley, you may be slightly disappointed. Oh there are some surprisingly graphic attacks from enemy native tribes and Tarzan has an intense battle with a crocodile yet it doesn't seem quite enough somehow and doesn't make up for the story feeling slightly disconnected at times. There's a gaping plot hole here involving Captain Fry, after Tarzan is in his cage, later losing him. Also the lizards at the end are more likely to produce laughter than terror.",1
6,"A strange entry in the MGM series, 'Tarzan Escapes' eschews a predictable plot and at times wants to be a serious melodrama about Tarzan and Jane's relationship. Well, as serious as any such plot could be, anyway. The film reportedly was re-shot extensively because of excessive gore, and there are hints of such in the released version, both in the way certain natives are killed and in a cave where large, deadly lizards dwell. Perhaps all of this and more contribute to the weird way the film progresses, alternating between the aforementioned Tarzan/Jane soap opera and much jungle violence. There is also excessive comic relief provided by Herbert Mundin. Over the course of the series, particularly the episodes with Johnny Weismuller and Maureen O'Sullivan, it's made clear time and again that Tarzan and Jane are madly in love. One can certainly see why the Apeman is ape over Jane, but why on earth Jane feels the same for him is never adequately explained. No matter how many times she tries to explain it, it just doesn't make sense that a beautiful, sophisticated English woman should prefer living in a tree, barefoot and wearing a skimpy animal skin, with a monkey and a guy who has a vocabulary of about twenty words. It is hinted at, sometimes pretty heavy-handedly, that the jungle love they share beats a one-night stand in London any day, so maybe that's it. In any event, their unbreakable if inexplicable bond is tested in 'Tarzan Escapes,' when Jane agrees to return to England briefly with her two cousins to deal with some legal matters regarding a will. Tarzan doesn't take it well at all; he's convinced she's dumping him for good and will never return. He mopes around the jungle while Cheetah tries to cheer him up. Meanwhile, Captain Fry (John Buckler), leader of the safari, has plans to kidnap Tarzan and take him back to England as a circus attraction. Yeah, right. Give up that crazy dream. Fry eventually runs afoul of a dangerous tribe; Tarzan comes to the rescue and saves them all but realizing Fry's treachery, forces him back into a cave where those killer lizards reside, and that's the end of Fry. Though things were not nearly as standardized as they would be in later MGM films, we see the beginnings of recurring ideas and situations, such as the elaborate treehouse and its Flintstones-style amenities, like the elephant-operated elevator. (Why Tarzan needs an elevator when he can just run up the tree ten times as fast is another good question. It must be for Jane.) The production still bears the creakiness of early 30's film-making, despite an impressive use of varied sets and locales; there was a very noticeable change starting with the next film in the series. From then on, the MGM polish became unmistakable and would remain for the rest of the run. 'Tarzan Escapes', perhaps because of its extensive reworking, stands apart from other entries in the series and taken on its own terms, is very much worth seeing.",1
8,"This was the first Weissmuller Tarzan film I ever saw, back in the 1970's in the days of UHF TV, and while I enjoyed it then, I enjoy it more now, being able to see a less-redacted version via DVD. As an adult, I appreciate the clever and at times powerful script by Cyril Hume (who wrote 'Forbidden Planet,' the most perfect scifi film of all time) and I also appreciate the often artful camera work...the fleeting view of Tarzan as he first approaches the safari's camp, as well as the swimming scenes stand out in particular.As every other IMDb review points out, a few very grisly scenes were cut before theatrical release, and so there are a couple abrupt jumps in the story. Also, there is some usage of fast motion (to simulate more aggressive fighting), stock footage, and some of the comedy relief is also clumsy. And of course, the depiction of Africans is racist. These are the flaws in this picture, and are typical of the era. I forgive them since the overall experience of this picture is enjoyable and interesting.This is likely the most violent of the MGM Tarzan films, and certainly depicts Our Hero dispatching justice in a very cold, yet understandable, fashion. At the same time, this film has some of the most emotional and heart-rending moments of the series, and there is something vaguely messianic in the way Tarzan, believing himself betrayed by one he loves, willingly enters the cage, later to descend physically down a violently rocky slope into unconsciousness, only to re-emerge into the world commanding an army of avenging elephants.Weissmuller has all the moves down here, and utters mono-syllabic sentences with the strength of a conqueror or the vulnerability of three year old child, depending upon the needs of the script. There is a moment of genius when Tarzan says 'Secret?' to Jane...it's as if he is simultaneously asking for the definition of the word and asking Jane why in heaven's name she is keeping a secret from him. While Weissmuller was never a Lawrence Olivier, Lawrence Olivier never could have played Tarzan, so there you go.Besides fun and adventure, this film contains several extended commentaries on human behavior, on relationships, and on moral values. O'Sullivan gives her usual magnificent performance and there is suitable Tarzanic stage business throughout. Lovers of old adventure and fantasy films, as well as lovers of the Tarzan series, are likely to enjoy and appreciate this film.",1
9,"Unfortunately, the Hays Code no longer permitted the lovely Maureen O'Sullivan playing Jane, to wear the skimpy jungle bikini she wore that barely covered the essential parts of her anatomy in the first two Tarzan/Jane movies her and Johnny Weismueller did for MGM. She is still gorgeous but the bikini is now some sort of jungle miniskirt.While the sex had been toned down, no shortage of action and violence in this. Good plot as once again Jane is being deceived by family and an evil white hunter, Captain Fry (John Buckler) who intends to capture Tarzan to put on display. Fry is thoroughly detestable and ruthless. Tarzan gets to battle it out with bloodthirsty savages and wild animals. His battle royal with a crocodile that must be at least 25' long is a classic. Good performance by Cheeteh.",1
7,"If I was to summarize my feelings about ""Tarzan Escapes"" in one sentence, this is what I would write: I *loved* the first two Tarzan films, and I *like* the third film.""Tarzan Escapes"" isn't a bad film, but it's clear that the writers had used up a lot of their imagination on the first two installments. The basic premise is that Jane's cousins Rita and Eric go into the jungle to find Jane. Once again, they head to the Mutia Escarpment (the elephant graveyard), and they commission Captain Fry, along with his comedic friend Rawlins, to lead them there.The first half of this film is basically kiddie fare. The Rawlins character attempts (but never quite succeeds) at providing comic relief, and the animal scenes are less perilous and more comedic. However, about halfway through the movie, a sudden twist occurs, and the story takes on a much more serious tone. It's not too strong for kids, so they should still enjoy it all. And adults, if they can overlook the bad comedy in the first half, should find the overall film very satisfying.Tarzan has broadened his vocabulary a bit since the first two films, and his and and Jane's relationship is still sparkling. Cheeta has more of a role in this movie, and they've spiffed up their jungle décor considerably. (Only the castaways on Gilligan's Island have a more deluxe setup without electricity.)Several of the animal scenes are lifted from ""Tarzan and His Mate"", so some of the excitement and freshness are lost. But there is still plenty to get excited about. I did notice that the sound quality is much improved. (I had to watch parts of the first two films with subtitles just to understand what they were saying. The sound is much clearer in the third movie.)Overall, it's a rousing adventure film. It's nice to say hi to our jungle friends once again, and there are enough new elements to be more than just a rehash of the previous stories.",1

She's stressed about getting into Juilliard. Her parents (Mireille Enos, Joshua Leonard) are formerly alternative folks. They talk her into a family outing on a snow day and they get into an accident.Chloë Grace Moretz puts her incalculable charms at work. She brings as much life as possible to the rather conventional young adult melodrama. The romance doesn't have the best chemistry. It would help if Jamie Blackley is a more compelling actor. The flashback structure doesn't have enough drama to offer. The movie slowly runs out of story rather than build to a climax. The only question is whether she lives or dies.

Mia must make the mental decision to recover or move on and follow the light.

For people who couldn't cry enough over ""The Fault In Our Stars"" this film is here to help wrangle that last bit of moisture from your tear duct. Mom (Mireille Enos) explains life to Mia while doing dishes and inspired the title for my review.Actors gave a good performance for a script that was a bit formulaic. Newcomer Ali Milner did an excellent job as Liz, the friend.Parental Guide: No F-bombs, or nudity. Implied sex.",1
6,"I'm pretty sure the novel worked better than the movie itself. Which is by no way a fault of its main star. Nor the way the story evolves (cannot comment if the structure is the same as the book it is based on, as I haven't read that). It will also be touching and I'm sure you will be moved by how the story is portrayed.Still while we all can relate to many of the given themes here, the movie goes more on the romantic route than the dramatic one. Which is a shame because there are quite a few things that could've been played out better (imho). It's easy to keep up with the time frame, even if it might confuse a few people at first. What's important, is that you're always with the main character (no matter what your stance on religion, after Life and more things are, this is a story, nothing more nothing less). And Chloe takes another step (acting-wise) in the right direction",1

8,"If I Stay features movie star on the rise,Chloe Grace Moretz and gives her all in this young adult romantic film that tells the story of Mia,who is faced with the decision whether to live or to join her family,who all died in a car accident.In addition to that,there is a storyline involving her with regards to making a decision as to whether to pursue a musical career at Julliard or be with her love of her life,Adam portrayed by Jamie Blackley. This film directed by R.J. Cutler that has a supporting cast the includes Mireille Enos,Joshua Leonard,Aisha Hinds and veteran actor Stacy Keach is based on Gayle Foreman's novel of the same title is dominated by music and melodrama together with some elements of the supernatural wherein we see Mia in a spiritual existence as she sees the people who visits her while in coma fighting for her existence at the ICU.It was evident that the movie is directed at a particular audience namely young adults.Too bad that people not within that age group would find the movie lacking authenticity,emotionally manipulative and a tearjerker that modern movies at present move away from.Somehow even mature young adults belonging in that particular group would somehow find it clichéd and predictable as well and would lack appreciation for it.Aside from that,the love story involving Mia and Adam is far from believable as well considering that both barely have similar traits and characteristics.Even the type of music that they play are different from each other with one being classical music and the other being rock music.It just manages to put the familiar young adult romantic relationship that people of different characteristics can pull through a successful relationship.But overall,it just provides the viewer some confusion on their attraction to one another despite their lack of similarities character-wise.The performances in the film is satisfactory overall.But Chloe Grace Moretz was definitely far from satisfactory.It was outstanding as she was able to make the viewer empathize with her character as Mia with the many events of her life from falling in love with Adam;the pressure she felt during her audition at Julliard;the life-changing decisions she was about to make from either joining her parents and young brother who all failed to survive the car accident or joining her boyfriend by continuing her existence; and her maturity from being a young girl into a young adult the moment she entered into a relationship with Adam.Despite the emotional manipulation and melodramatic elements of the storyline involving her character, Moretz somehow minimized them through her performance as Mia including her indecision in either staying in existence or dying at deathbed to join her family who just passed away that somehow slowed the story down somehow and provided it some seemingly boring moments. In the end, one could see the potential she has and a great future that she possess as an actress in the years to come.In summary, Moretz's portrayal of Annie alone was able to lift this young adult romance film higher than just an average rating.",1
10,I like the bit at the start where the lion roared. Better than ghost I reckon,1
4,"I went into this blind. I knew nothing about the book it was based upon. It didn't take long before I realized this might not be my thing. It's obviously aimed at a younger audience. Judging by this I will assume the book is also one of those Young Adult type things. That isn't necessarily bad; I've enjoyed several of those movies over the years. This one, though, missed the mark. The narration and music obsession totally got on my nerves. We get it: you like music. 786 references is overkill. It doesn't even feel sincere. Chloe Moretz does a less than impressive job. She's one of the younger actors today whose career I can see either lasting a long time or fizzling out within a few years. We'll see. Her parents here are terrible. The dad is played by the guy from Blair Witch Project. I didn't even know he was still around. Stacy Keach gives the most memorable performance in the movie as the grandfather. The guy she falls madly in love with is a poorly written cliché of a Cameron Crowe character. He has no chemistry with Chloe and their love story is inane. Really, the whole script is just pretentious drivel that tugs on the heart strings with no subtlety at all. It's also overlong and often dull. It makes A Walk to Remember look like a classic.",-1

7,"Teenage Mia is a cello prodigy. She lives with her lovable younger brother and her impossibly awesome parents. She is a bit socially awkward which is why, at first, she doesn't respond easily to the interest shown in her by up and coming singer/guitarist Adam. But he is genuine, and their blooming relationship is marred only by conflict over their possible separation if her application to go to Juilliard is successful. Which is why she did't tell him she'd applied. Which is why he is upset with her. Who'd be a teenager in love, right? Things get a lot simpler when her family has a horrific car crash and she is lying in hospital at death's door faced with the choice of living or dying.This teen weepie involves Chloe Moretz doing an awful lot of running around hospital corridors barefoot, shouting things at people who can't hear her because she is in limbo, hovering between life and death. It could usefully have done with some special effects rather than people conveniently holding doors open just as she wants to run through. Yes I know, money.Moretz is as good as always in a film which, to me, was no better than OK. It concentrated rather too much on peevish teenagerness, and not enough on the fairly big issues which were implicit in its basic premise.The performances were good, though, especially Stacy Keach, better than I've ever seen him.",1
10,"This is a well balanced romantic drama. The movie has a good balance between family tragedy of a horrific car accident and teen romance of young love. Also the theme of music is well shared between classical cello and Pacific Northwest rock band. The romance is a convincing tale - not too passionate for their age but with the real problems of differing paths and East Coast (Juillard) vs West Coast (rock band). This is a problem that face many couples and it's good to see proper issues as the problem instead of trumped up melodrama. The story felt more real than ""The Fault in Our Stars"" and less sentimental too. In fact although the tale is a sad one, it's the best of the recent teen based romance movies far better than ""The Giver"".Chloe Grace Moretz proves she can do anything from horror (Carrie) to action (Kick Ass) to moving romantic drama. Her face is sensitive and expressive. Even though she is very pretty she is such a good actress she can still pull off the shy musical prodigy without being fake. Her love interest is played by Jamie Blackley who does a good job without overacting. He isn't too good looking so it's a believable romance. The ex rocker type parents seem like they couldn't have had such a beautiful daughter but never mind. Stacy Keach is surprisingly effective as her grandfather.Well done - moving, involving, rings true.",1
5,"'IF I STAY': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Teen melodrama flick, based on the popular YA novel (of the same name) by Gayle Forman. It tells the story of a teenager who has a major 'out-of-body experience', after being in a severe car accident, in which she must decide whether to go on living, or die; as her family did. It stars Chloe Grace Moretz, as the teen, and costars Jamie Blackley, Mireille Enos, Joshua Leonard, Liana Liberato and Stacey Keach. It was directed by R.J. Cutler and written by Shauna Cross (who also wrote the outstanding 2009 teen drama flick 'WHIP IT', and the novel it was based on). I found this movie to be pretty boring, and excessively cheesy as well.Moretz plays Mia Hall; a teenager that's in love with classical music, and playing cello, despite the fact that her parents, Kat (Enos) and Denny (Leonard), are really into rock music; and her dad was in a mildly successful alternative rock band (when he was younger). She falls in love with a rocker from school, as fate would have it, named Adam Wilde (Blackley). Just when she's deep into making really tough and dramatic teenage decisions, about her new love life, her family is involved in a horrific car accident; and Mia falls into a coma. She then experiences life 'out-of-body' and must decide whether to keep living, or pass on; as her parents did. Mia's past life is told through flashbacks.I like the premise of the movie, and I do like well made films adapted from young-adult novels, but this movie is just poorly made. It's way too melodramatic and badly paced; it's even excruciatingly dull at times. Both the director and the writer have made better movies than this, but they really dropped the ball here! I also like Moretz, in other films as well, but she gives a pretty unimpressive performance here too. Stacey Keach is the only person that does anything impressive, in this movie, but his part is too brief. Teens, and die-hard fans of the book, might fall for this sappy junk; but everyone else will be bored.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/yW1G90SYF_o",-1
6,"Really my header says it all. I expected this to be a lovely, heart wrenching drama/romance filled with teen angst and a ridiculously syrupy sweet story and honestly? It hardly was any of that. The story seemed to drag excruciatingly so and it jumps back and forth in a way that never really works. I actually thought 3/4 of the way through the movie that they were doing something clever, playing a trick on you where the flash backs were actually flash forwards and I was getting excited that something unique and clever would come out of this...and then...nothing. Dreary. Almost boring. How unfortunate! I haven't yet seen The Fault In My Stars but I'm hoping it is far better than this. I am glad to say that the cast for the most part saves this from being a complete awful mess. The cast is actually very good and I would even say that much of the dialogue and script is pretty good too. Its the plot and the pacing where the film truly stumbles. The chemistry with our lead ""Romeo and Juliette"" if you will is okay at best and with a romance full of passion and angst you want incredible chemistry. Any of the romantic classics the chemistry is phenomenal.I adore Chloe Grace Moretz. I think she is one of the best young talents in Hollywood period. Since the moment I saw her in Let Me In I knew she was a talent to be reckoned with. Her charisma on screen shines through here and her role is very good (though a little predictable) but she does well in it. This is definitely a starring vehicle for her and the slow pace doesn't take away from her performance which is very good. Jamie Blackley is her Romeo. He's decent. He plays the role well. The role is also painstakingly predictable. He's a young rocker with a hint of goth to him and he's created with the sole purpose to make teen girls swoon and I suppose he does that well. The chemistry between them is decent which helps. Mireille Enos and Joshua Leonard are fantastic as the free spirited parents of Moretz's Mia. Enos and Leonard have a lot of great lines in the film, very memorable life moments and they are fun together and as individual characters. Stacy Keach might give the best performance in the whole film. He is one to watch because he is quite honestly stunning. His scene beside Mia and his desperate speech to her is heart wrenching. Liana Liberato as Moretz's best friend is okay but very underused and just sort of there.So the cast ranges from good to great...so why does the movie fail? Simple. It is painfully predictable, horribly mis-paced, and very scattered in its story telling. I think this lays solely on the shoulders of our director and perhaps writers too. RJ Cutler has absolutely no experience in this genre and it has such a direct demographic that it is aimed at. Cutler is a pro at documentaries and at some Television but how would he get this job? Even screenwriter Shauna Cross who has done some good work is not right for this film. I often wonder what studios are thinking when they give scripts like this to people who don't have the right area of expertise. Its an average film aimed at young teen girls with too much sex to really appeal to that age group and not enough direction to make it worthwhile. Skip this one and wait for another romance with more oomph behind it. 6/10 (most of this rating if not all is for the cast.)",1
4,"Off the top, I cannot think of a film that brought with it higher expectations. In my review of KickAss2, I pointed out that Chloë Grace Moretz was not merely good in the film, she was the ONLY good thing in it, showing a knack for saucy dialog and delivery, and generally (given her age) being willing to go further with her character than other members of the cast twice or three times her age.And I have always had a weak spot for these tales of life between life, Enter the Void, Here Comes Mr. Jordan, Stairway to Heaven, these are some of the films that spring to mind.So, how can you not have a great film here? Easy? Terrible script (so bad it should never have made it to production) along with some really bad casting choices and top it off with some of the worst editing in the history of the medium.That last item is especially important since a film about someone wandering in limbo (real time) while having flashbacks (past time) requires editing at the Oscar level. Here it seems the budget can't even afford an editor NAMED Oscar.Chloë Grace Moretz, who verily stole KickAss2, and had the best lines in KickAss1, seems here lost and completely unconnected with her character or the hapless audience.In fact, it is veteran Stacy Keech who actually steals the few scenes that he has, and for mere moments in an otherwise forgettable exercise makes the viewer CARE about what happens next.Fans of Ms. Moretz (and there are many, including, don't forget, this scribe) need not feel compelled to shoot the messenger (reviewer) here, a quick glance at her bio shows her to be a very hot property now, with multiple projects underway, and many chances in her long career ahead to make up for this travesty.",-1
7,"""Sometimes you make choices and sometimes they make you."" Mia has a great and loving family. A boyfriend who is in love with her and she is one step away from her dream of going to Juilliard. All that changes after a car wreck leaves her alone and fighting for her life. Watching her family and friends at the hospital and looking back over her life she must decide to stay living and chase her dreams or let go and be with her family. First thing I have to say is that while this is a sad movie it wasn't as depressing as I was expecting. The movie did a really good job of making it emotional without feeling forced. The movie was able to stay away from becoming overly melodramatic or too cheesy. On the other hand though the movie was a little generic in some parts and you were able to see certain things coming. The whole movie you are trying to guess whether she will stay or go and I had a feeling that the choice would make or break the movie. I could see points for both sides and I have to say that I thought the ending was perfect. Overall, a movie that wasn't cheesy but it was a little generic in some parts. The ending was perfect and really helped the movie. This was better then I was expecting. I give it a B.",1
6,"If I Stay The worst thing about having to die young is living an eternity wearing nothing but oshkosh b'gosh clothing.Luckily, the half-dead girl in this drama doesn't shop in the kids' section.An aspiring cellist, Mia (Chloë Grace Moretz), is left in limbo after a car accident kills both her parents (Mireille Enos, Jamie Blackley).Near death, Mia oversees her comatose body, as her grandfather (Stacy Keach), best friend (Liana Liberato) and on-again/off-again rock-star boyfriend Adam (Jamie Blackley) wait by her hospital bedside.Reliving the events leading up to the collision, Mia's post-punk parents, her dream of Julliard, and her troubled romance with the touring Adam are explored in-depth.With its facile music factoids and obvious artistic love interest, this adaptation of the YA novel caters to weepy teen girls.However, more discerning minds will find it a trivial idealization of death. Besides, a real teen's life flashing before their eyes mostly consists of them texting. Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",1
6,"Greetings from Lithuania.""If I Stay"" (2014) is so sweet and cheezee that unfortunately it comes as a disappointment for me. There is absolutely no chemistry between two leads, and when a movie about love and life has no chemistry between lovers, it's a problem. ""If I Stay"" is nothing new, nothing original, just an empty eye candy at running time 1h 40 min. It drags. The pacing is OK but the screenplay is so predictable, so one dimensional and cheezee that at moments i had my eyes rolling over the screen. Chloë Grace Moretz has nothing to do in this flick, it's definitely far from her best. Overall, for 14 years old girls this will do just fine, for all older i can say, you can safely skip this. It's not a bad movie by any means, just unfortunately it's very predictable, it has nothing new or exciting to offer and at running time 100 min. it drags and repeats itself - it has well intentions, but unfortunately it just doesn't click.",1
8,"After a severe car accident, the girl in a coma has an out-of-body experience (astral projection) during which she observes people in her environment and remembers her life so far, trying to decide whether to wake up or let go.The basic premise is, at least from the perspective of my experience, quite original, but the movie overall is not. However, although there are a lot of clichés, the story is very emotional and believable, and it is easy to identify with well-acted characters. Visually beautiful, with well-blended flashbacks (which I usually do not like) and pleasant music. Chloë Grace Moretz proves once again that she is not just a pretty face. Of the nearly forty of her films I've seen, this is one of her best performances, and as movies in general, only ""Hugo,"" ""Let Me In,"" and ""The Poker House"" left a stronger impression on me.8/10.",1
4,"After loving the roles that Chloe Grace Moretz played in ""Carrie"" & ""The Equalizer"", I decided to give this one a shot after recently having watched (and enjoyed more than I thought) a similar teen drama in ""The Fault In Our Stars"". Unfortunately, I felt that this one was kind of based on a gimmick.For a basic plot summary, ""If I Stay"" tells the story of Mia (Moretz), a high school girl who plays a beautiful cello. This musical talent gets her noticed by cute guy Adam (Jamie Blackley) and she is awaiting a letter from Juilliard's music program. On a seemingly normal family drive, however, Mia is involved in a car crash putting the entire family in the hospital. As ""physical Mia"" fights for her life in the hospital, ""spirit Mia"" watches the action unfold as a kind of ghost entity, trying to discover what is happening to her and her family members. Many moments of the previous year are flashed-back to as Mia discovers what is really important in her life.The main problem with this film is that it seems to be based on what I consider to be a very gimmicky concept, that being ""spirit Mia"" watching herself (and her family) in the hospital interspersed with flashbacks. What purpose did that serve in the film besides to give Moretz more time to act? It all could have been done with Mia just laying in her hospital bed. All that would have been missed was a few reaction shots.Couple that with the fact that the story here didn't strike me as particularly strong to begin with. Maybe if one appreciates cello music more than I do, or is a sucker for sad movies, they will find more significance here, but I never felt that what I was watching made the jump from ""contrived"" to ""real"".The highlights? Moretz is still great in her role (as convoluted as it may be sometimes), while a grandfather character (played by Stacy Keach) practically steals the show with ever scene he is in. In a movie that should be filled with such emotion, it is telling that a guy on the screen in a very limited role has such an impact.Thus, while I know I shouldn't directly compare this to ""Fault In Our Stars"", it just so happens that I saw both within about a two-week span. ""Fault"" made me actually care about what was going on and drew me in. ""Stay""...not so much. At times I even got a little bored waiting for something to happen. Like I said, Chloe Grace Moretz is still solid, but it isn't enough to inject life into this vehicle.",-1
6,"Mia has an accident and she fells into coma. But her spirit is still alive, wondering the hospital halls, trying to decide whenever to stay alive and face a life as an orphan, or die and leave her love of her life behind. So, basically the trailer and the description don't impress easily, but If I stay is really a great film. Maybe the performances are a little weak, but the story is strong and vibrant. It is not just a teenage love story, its about music, family, death. And the director works the flashback (that are many) smoothly and that keeps the interest high throughout the movie. The after life questions were a little clumsily handled, but the end really satisfies the audience, as it is not too cliché, just enough for the movie's atmosphere. So 6 out of 10 for if I stay.",1
4,"Review:  I'm in two minds about this movie because I liked the intriguing out of body experience  footage, although she should have known that no one could hear her but I didn't like the corny love story which took over a majority of the storyline. Chloe's acting was also a bit annoying because she kept on wondering around the hospital in a daze. The movie is about an inspiring cello player who falls in love with a popular lead singer in a up and coming rock group. There's then this big accident which destroyed the whole family and leaves them with life threatening injuries. Whilst in hospital the main character, played by Chloe Grace Moretz, has an out of body experience and runs round the hospital, scared that she's going to loose her whole family. The movie then travels back in time to show how she met her boyfriend and her relationship with her family. The problem with this movie is that the love story really took over the whole plot, even though the family is fighting for there lives. I was waiting for ages for something to happen, and when it finally does, it's nothing that amazing. The teenagers got on my nerves after a while, especially the guy who was playing her boyfriend and the ending was proper corny. Anyway, I personally lost interest after a while and I don't think that the concept was executed that well. Not that great!Round-Up: Chloe Grace Moretz has been getting some major roles lately and she always seems to be playing the lead but I personally don't think that her performances have been that amazing. I think she was the wrong choice for Carrie and Kiss Ass 2 was really disappointing but she was great in the first Kick Ass and her small part in the Equalizer wasn't that bad. I don't think that she has had a role that has pushed her to the limit yet but at the ripe age of 18, she's got plenty of time to shine. She has achieved so much at such an early age so I hope that it all doesn't go to her head. The rest of the cast were mediocre along with the whole back and forth thing that got on my nerves. Anyway, the film made a healthy profit at the box office, due to the adverts showing all the best bits but I personally wasn't that impressed with the film. Budget: $11million Worldwide Gross: $78.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their romantic/dramas about a girl whose an inspiring cello player and falls in love with a rock star but she is close to death after a fatal car crash. 4/10",-1
1,"Music is a recurring literal and allegorical motif in If I Stay. In keeping with this tired trend, if If I Stay was a song, it would be a weapy Avril Lavigne ballad: fake, melodramatic, and boring. It's blandness to the nth degree, with little to no style OR substance to pull it out of its own self-absorbed pretension. Who will this movie appeal to? It's too slow for tweens, too tepid for adults. Unless you're looking for something stupid, vapid, depressing, clichéd, annoying, and laughless, don't bother. The movie's essentially a fantasy for shy teenage girls: the dreamy, popular older band-boy inexplicably notices you, pursues you, and falls in love with you. She's a shy but stuck-up classical cellist jerk. Her love interest is a selfishly immature hipster jerk. They are a match made in conceited jerk heaven! But when a tragic accident puts you on the brink of death, your conscience must decide: do I keep living, or do I avoid pain by dying? This pretense could make for some interesting storytelling, with a ghost having to watch her life play out without affecting itbut nope. Moretz, who I normally like, is given nothing to work with and turns in her worst performance to date. A bevy of Portlandia-style caricatures parade around screen shooting for authenticity and consistently missing. I couldn't contain my eye-rolling at the onslaught of cynical clichés and bad quips about the ""power"" of music. Some decent scenes of actual musicianship, a couple of good performances (Grandpa), and a modicum of sweetness are completely overwhelmed by the inauthentic and never-ending dullness.",-1
10,"Mia(Chloe Grace Moretz) a bright seventeen old, who is in hopes to go to Julliard, cause she is talented cello player. But one day could change all, when she gets into a serious car accident with her folks, starts having an out of body experience, she gets caught between life and death, and during that, we start to see things unfold in her life.Chloe Grace Moretz really gives the performance of her career, she just won't be thought of has Hit Girl, I would nominate her for a Oscar. And everybody else here really gives good performances. Because they feel real, not just acting. Bring plenty of handkerchiefs, I also liked the love story, and at times when you think the story is gonna go one way, it takes you by surprise.",1
6,"""If I Stay"" offers believable characters and a narrative that is enjoyable at times, and occasionally interesting, but is undercut by its silly central premise, that the movie barely shows anyway. It's as if the filmmakers knew it wasn't working, and just tacked it on out of obligation to the source text.Indeed, it's the kind of thing that works better on the printed page than up on the screen. The main character is involved in a car crash which puts her whole family on life support. She wanders around as an invisible ghost - though people still stop and move out of her way, clearly able to see her - and wonders if she should come back to earth.See, on the printed page you aren't noticing that a character is supposed to be invisible, and yet extras can still see her. The camera captures everything its pointed at; the writer directs your attention much more easily.The movie is mostly flashbacks anyway, making you wonder why the ghost stuff was even necessary.",1
6,"I have to say this particular Christian film I enjoyed very much. It might have
something to do with star Alyssa Addison and the character of the eternally
optimistic Iris Kreedle that she created.To say that Addison is socially a misfit is putting it mildly. But when Erin Bethea
who is looking for a roommate to share expenses with in their apartment she's
not in a position to choose.It starts off slow but Addison gradually wins over people. If not here personality which admittedly an acquired taste it's her work on behalf of a kid's
shelter. She's the very definite of generous. In fact Bethea gets downright
jealous.This is a reworking of the Pollyanna story which goes back to Mary Pickford in
silents and of course Hayley Mills for Disney Studios. Addison to be commended for creating this infectious personality. Once seen not likely to
be fogotten.",1
8,"Being in my 60s I usually find comedies based around young 'modern' people far from appealing! But I thought I'd give this one a go, and I'm very glad I did. As a whole Christian themed films have improved by leaps and bounds over the last decade or so. The bar has been set much higher than it was (by the likes of Jefferson Moore et al), and this film certainly reaches. Although it's a Christian film, just watch it with a mind to identifying with the characters in it. You won't be diappointed.",1
7,"GOD OF WAR is another fine historical war flick made as a collaboration between China and Hong Kong. It has that Hong Kong sensibility in the many action sequences, which are well-choreographed, gruesome, and hard-hitting. The film is one for lovers of Chinese cinema, featuring roles for two Hong Kong film legends, Sammo Hung and Yasuaki Kurata, and both get to show their mettle in some skilful one-to-one combat scenes. The rest is a mix of politics, strategy, and characterisation in the best Asian sense. There's a rather slow midsection but some great early battle sequences and a ferocious climax which lets rip for around 40 minutes or so.",1
4,"For a historical movie I have to admit I'm not too impressed by the result. Not that I had a very high opinion of Chinese movies before starting to watch God Of War, as most of the time you have alot of actors or extras overacting. For example it all feels unnatural when you see them running around, never saw anybody run this way (there is absolutely no way any Chinese will win a race if they all run like that). The only good thing about this movie are some fighting scenes but even those could have been much better. The movie is just too long, too repetitive, and to be honest their strategies are just becoming boring after awhile. It didn't do it to me and I'm pretty sure I won't be the only one that will be disappointed.",-1
7,"A good plot, more engaging than normal for the genre, did not have flights, dances in the air during the fights, but good fights, with all the charm and lightness of the Orientals ... A little long, which makes it a little tedious, because the plot is good, but it's not that impressive... Among the antagonists I highlight the character and the performance of the Pirate Samurai, great ending...",1
8,"God Of War is a pretty solid period war/action movie from director Gordon Chan(who directed some of my favorite movies, Fist Of Legend and Beast Cops). This is probably the best acting performance to date from leading man Wenzhuo aka Vincent Zhao. He is brilliant in the fight scenes and there is quite a bit of battle action to go around in this picture. The choreographed action looks great and is very fluent, but complex. The film also looks very sharp and has good character development and pacing. Sammo Hung appears only briefly, but has a memorable cameo and good chemistry with leading man Wenzhuo Zhao. The legendary Yasuaki Kurata gives a powerful performance as Japanese general and gives a lot of empathy and insight to the Japanese side of this historical conflict. This film has elements of Red Cliff and Warlords, but most reminds me of Korean movie The Admiral Roaring Tides. All above are quality productions and highly recommended and I am very impressed by this excellent film.",1
9,"I don't often watch historical Chinese movie but with God of War(2017) it a different story.Directed by Gordon Chan starring Sammo Hung,Wenzhuo Zhao and a handful of talented actors God of War deliver anything you want from a epic historical movie.The stand alone fight scene is well choreographed and the big action set pieces scene is just so bloody and brutal.Many fan of Sammo Hung will disappointed with this movie cause the real star is Wenzhuo Zhao when he sold the role as a brave general that also very afraid of his wife.It not the best movie China can offer but in the meantime it sure gonna entertain many people.Strongly suggest watch on theater",1
6,"This is good old cheesy fun. Some of the acting is pretty bad and some of the characters are one dimensional, but overall I enjoyed it. It looks great and some of the fighting scenes are pretty awesome. If you want a film where you can just kick back and switch your mind off, then this is it. 6.5 / 10 is about right for me.",1
8,"My preference is for period pieces over modern day settings (especialy not the Hong Kong cop thrillers). I watched this a day after rewatching the ""Seven Samuri"" and was inrtigued by the number of blunderblusses available given there were only three in 7 Samuri (set some decades later). Also I learned this must have taken place in the pre-isolationist period of Japan as they were trying to take over coastal China through pirate cloaking. I enjoyed the many subplots: ronin trying to be samuri, peasants trying to be soldiers but especially the singlemindedness of General Qi's wife.The film's cinematography (composition, colour, camera movement) was reminiscent of Kagemusha, the Shadow Warrior. The Japanese and Chinese were given a balance of presentation and at times I was not sure who to root for. Intrigues at the Chinese court placed the story line at another level. The Japanese general kept to the lie that he was no more than a pirate. An honourable undertaking in capturing this little known period (to Westerners at least) with elegance, elan and enthralling story telling.",1
8,"Wow, this was one hell of a ride! If you like martial arts and warfare, you NEED to watch this movie! The epic sword fighting scenes in particular, especially the final fight, are a must watch! None of that flying nonsense you get in Hero or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon either, this is (very) fast, gritty, and realistic sword fighting! And you get LOTS of it! There are also several intense and mesmerising scenes of warfare, and there's lots of bloody violence, so you better be ready for that. There is some great cinematography as well. It doesn't have the same kind of high caliber dramatic story or acting as movies like Red Cliff (although these are still good), and there isn't as much fancy strategy as in some other good warfare movies (but it still has a fair amount of it), but the action is top tier! Personally I found this to be one of the most satisfying movies I've watched all year, after having watched tons and tons of mediocre or disappointing movies both from The West and The East this year (including many I had high hopes for...). So if you like warfare and warfare strategy, martial arts, and especially sword fighting, or all of the above, then definitely watch this as soon as you can!",1
8,"I kept skipping over this movie due to the violence expected in such a war movie. But I finally gave in just so I could remove the movie from my queue and I was pleasantly surprised to find an engaging, well-acted, historic movie. Bloody fight scenes were done without excessive violence (as compared to other war movies). So at least I could sit through those without feeling nauseated. There were some plot lines that caused me to scratch my head, such as why the general's wife was so agitated by the general. And the final, closing scene showing her waiting for him then disappearing into the house, closing the door, was puzzling and didn't quite make the impact. Other than that, there were many memorable moments to savor, especially the final showdown fight scene--epic! This is not a propaganda movie by any means: if your country is attacked by pirates, from any country, you'd do your damnedest to protect it and drive them away, wouldn't you? The movie presented the pirates' side with equal respect and dignity. I agree with another reviewer that there were times I didn't know whom I should be rooting for. The Japanese General, in particular, was presented as noble, dignified and clever in warcraft, and his love for his nephew shone. He could have escaped, but he stayed; for the shame of returning from a failed war campaign was too great to bear. So the captain went down with his ship. And he showed great humility, to boot. When the Chinese General asked him for his name, his response was simply, what's so important in a name. He deemed his stature as a great samurai being relegated to just a pirate, per se, was degrading to his name. And this proud samurai chose to die his own way. I couldn't help but respect the character.",1
4,"All four stars for only, ONLY introducing Qi Jiguang to people who aren't aware of him. While I'm sure that's most people, this ""film"" is also a massive disservice to an amazing warrior.I realize Chinese film is notorious for putting a Chinese favoured twist on events, but this leaves the border of ludicrous far behind. To clarify, I don't mind wire stunts (i recall only one in this), I know what the symbolism is. That kind of ludicrous can't touch this. As if that weren't enough, plot holes and ridiculous logistics (they can't even keep the numbers straight) totally ruined any chance of me liking this movie even a little, I had to force myself to watch it to the end.To add insult to injury, Sammo is barely in it, which feels like robbery - but maybe he saw what was going on and ran for the hills... I sure would have.",-1
9,"I enjoyed watching this movie. I gave it only 9 stars because I felt that the relationships between the characters, husband-wife, friendships between soldiers and army men (generals, officers etc) were lacking substance. There is a lot of room for improvement regarding these connections between the characters but the movie compensate this fact with good fighting scenes and war strategies. Overall you will not be disappointed if you watch this movie because it is what it said it would be: historical war movie from 1575 China.",1
7,"I watched this on Netflix, and their discription of the film was something along the lines of ""a maverick leader and a clever young general take on the Japanese pirates amid bureaucratic intrigue in Ming Dynasty China"".
In reality, the film is more ""a clever young general takes on Japanese pirates"" with bureaucratic intrigue in Ming Dynasty China as a mere backdrop. The film does alllude to bureaucratic politics in the first half of the film, but it is left to the wayside into the second half with no mention of it at the conclusion of the story. We're sort of left hanging about the characters who appeared in the first half that were involved in the politics of the Ming Dynasty.The second half of the film focuses on two battles - and that's fine. However with a fairly crowded cast, some of the characters' death are left me feeling unempathetic. Had the film focused on developing these certain characters more in the first half of the film, it would've been more impactful. We simply didn't get time to grow attached to the characters that die.Personally, I think the movie would've been better if it just focused on the general chasing the pirates and with very light sprinkles of his maverick leader trying to get him the funds for his army. Then the first half of the film could focus on the general training his troops, and the second half can be the battles.
The movie also gets bogged down with comedic scenes between the General and his wife. I found it touching and funny, but it did make me stop and wonder when the battles were going to happen, this film is around the 2hr mark.However, these scenes were all to humanise the General and his wife, who plays an integral part in one of the battles later on in the film. She ticks the standard ""badass waifu"" that we all wish had our backs, and the actress does a pretty good job of convincing me that she's exhaustedly and desperately hacking away at Japanese soldiers.Now it would be jarring to see a 5ft6 petite woman carving her way through katanna wielding troops, but the film does it in a way that she manages to get the jump on them in the heat of battle, rather than going toe to toe with countless men. And of course, a few people have to bail her out in battle - she's not a Mary Sue (which is to be expected because Asian cinema knows how to write strong yet not overpowered female characters) So point in favour to the creative minds behind that.Next up, I appreciate how the film takes the time to develop the Japanese characters, from the wise leader, to the young and honourable samurai, and the dishonourable ronins.
The film makes a clear distinction that the ronin are the ones doing the messy work, and are barbaric in their behaviour much to the disgust of their samurai leaders. The samurai aren't the cliche evil Japanese characters we see so much in Chinese film, which is a nice change of pace for once. ""Ip Man"" was a bit too heavy handed on the anti-Japanese sentiment.Finally we have the action. It's good, no shaky cam and well choreographed scenes make it worth the wait. It's no ""Red Cliff"", but it is more than adequate and not as fantastical as other similar epics such as ""The Curse of the Golden Flower"" - which is a good thing.Overall, I enjoyed the film and the battle scenes definitely made up for the wait.",1
9,"It is a great movie, accurately telling the history between Japan and China in Ming dynasty. I especially love the 1-1 fight scene of General Qi and Commander Kumasawa and the languages were spoken in both Mandarin and Japanese. It also showed the characters of Chinese and Japanese. If you know nothing about the history, you might get bored, but you will enjoy this movie very much if you know a little bit of the story.",1

6,"There are no less than six production company intros before God of War has even begun, giving an idea of the amount of money and co-operation necessary to make this film possible. Fortunately, they come together to pull off some of the most impressive battle sequences seen this decade. Unfortunately, God of War has similar pitfalls to other films of this genre and blockbuster Chinese films in general; a distinct lack of human engagement.The year is 1557. A Japanese invasion force made up of trained samurai and bloodthirsty mercenaries have taken the Chinese coastal town of Cengang. After his previous success against such 'pirates', it befalls the renowned General Qi (Wenzhuo Zhao) to finish the siege and purge this great force from China for good.What could have been outright propaganda, rapacious Japanese against the noble Chinese, is actually a somewhat layered film with established characters and motives on both sides of the fight. The respect of the filmmakers passes down to the leads, the rivalry of Qi and Commander Kumasawa (Yasuaki Kurata) reminiscent of Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) and his French adversary in Master and Commander.God of War is attentive to a fault when it comes to historical authenticity, a middle section bloated by talk of an internal Chinese politics that never impacts the narrative at large. An early element of the plot is a Japanese general imprisoned on the Chinese mainland; this isn't followed up on as the plot progresses.As a lead, Qi is a cipher. The audience never really feels his irritation at the Chinese higher command, nor at the sacrifices he and his men must make for victory. Great effort is made to mourn characters thinly established.The most enjoyment I had with any of the characters was Lady Qi (Regina Wan). While at first her subplot feels as if it is going through the motions to justify a female lead, as the film progresses and she becomes more integral she is a joy to watch, asserting herself both against her husband and the Japanese invaders.Where the film really stands out is not in character development but in its set-pieces. The film opens with a visceral attempt to lift a siege, and every battle henceforth is an escalation. Gunpowder (a Chinese invention) explodes across the screen. Even in the heat of battle, director Gordon Chan can focus on visual flourishes as tiny as the twist of a spear. A minor point is that the definition of the Japanese army is 'pirates', which makes me wish there had been a little bit more plundering and naval warfare.The film makes a success of its martial arts sequences, hand to hand combat deftly interwoven with the clashing of armies. The highlight is when Qi faces off against a miner in order to secure his service, in a sequence that comes closest to any social subtext in the film.God of War is the sort of film the Politburo loves to see, a spectacular and historic representation of an ascendant China. It's also far more watchable and authentic than this year's mess, The Great Wall. Alas, God of War stands as more a film of spectacle than substance, and while enjoyable at times may not linger in the memory. The wait for Chinese films that can combine Sixth-Generation character study with state-approved high production budgets continues.",1

2. Proper leadership (like Xi jinping) can defeat all comers.
3. Women can fight, but in the end, they should stay home and wait for their husbands. Just what the Chinese government wants for its women. The five stars are for the fighting scenes, which were choreographed pretty well. Costuming was pretty good.",-1
